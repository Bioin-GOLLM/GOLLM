Broadband Dielectric Properties of Ex Vivo Bovine Liver Tissue Characterized at 
Ablative Temperatures.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the thermal and frequency dependence of dielectric 
properties of ex vivo liver tissue - relative permittivity and effective 
conductivity - over the frequency range 500 MHz to 6 GHz and temperatures 
ranging from 20 to 130 °C.
METHODS: We measured the dielectric properties of fresh ex vivo bovine liver 
tissue using the open-ended coaxial probe method (n = 15 samples). Numerical 
optimization techniques were utilized to obtain parametric models for 
characterizing changes in broadband dielectric properties as a function of 
temperature and thermal isoeffective dose. The effect of heating tissue at rates 
over the range 6.4-16.9 °C/min was studied. The measured dielectric properties 
were used in simulations of microwave ablation to assess changes in simulated 
antenna return loss compared to experimental measurements.
RESULTS: Across all frequencies, both relative permittivity and effective 
conductivity dropped sharply over the temperature range 89 - 107 °C. Below 
91 °C, the slope of the effective conductivity changes from positive values at 
lower frequencies (0.5-1.64 GHz) to negative values at higher frequencies 
(1.64-6 GHz). The maximum achieved correlation values between transient 
reflection coefficients from measurements and simulations ranged between 0.83 - 
0.89 and 0.68 - 0.91, respectively, when using temperature-dependent and 
thermal-dose dependent dielectric property parameterizations.
CONCLUSION: We have presented experimental measurements and parametric models 
for characterizing changes in dielectric properties of bovine liver tissue at 
ablative temperatures.
SIGNIFICANCE: The presented dielectric property models will contribute to the 
development of ablation systems operating at frequencies other than 2.45 GHz, as 
well as broadband techniques for monitoring growth of microwave ablation zones.
