Here, we present a protocol to assess demyelination in the corpus callosum of an 
acute cuprizone mouse model, which is routinely used to induce demyelination for 
studying myelin regeneration in the rodent brain. We describe the tracing of 
neural stem cells via intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen into adult 
Gli1CreERT2;Ai9 mice and the induction of demyelination with cuprizone diet. We 
also detail EdU administration, cryosectioning of the mouse brain, EdU labeling, 
and immunofluorescence staining to examine proliferation and myelination. For 
complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to 
Radecki et al. (2020).1.
