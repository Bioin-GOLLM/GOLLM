The cohesin complex controls faithful chromosome segregation by pairing sister 
chromatids after DNA replication until mitosis. In addition, it is crucial for 
hierarchal three-dimensional organization of the genome, transcription 
regulation and maintaining DNA integrity. The core complex subunits SMC1A, SMC3, 
STAG1/2, and RAD21 as well as its modulators, have been found to be recurrently 
mutated in human cancers. The mechanisms by which cohesin mutations trigger 
cancer development and disease progression are still poorly understood. Since 
cohesin is involved in a range of chromosome-related processes, the outcome of 
cohesin mutations in cancer is complex. Herein, we discuss recent discoveries 
regarding cohesin that provide new insight into its role in tumorigenesis.
