It has been found that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) exerts 
cytoprotection against Abeta amyloid-induced neuronal cell death. Deposits of 
Abeta amyloid are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Here, we examined whether IGF-I exerts protective activity against cell death 
induced by a familial AD (FAD)-linked mutant of amyloid precursor protein (APP), 
and we found that IGF-I protected cells from toxicity of FAD-associated V642I 
mutant of APP in multiple cell systems. IGFBP-3 blocked this action of IGF-I, 
but not of des(1-3)IGF-I, which was as active as IGF-I in the presence of 
IGFBP-3. The data also demonstrated that the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) mediates 
the protective activity of IGF-I. The antagonizing function of the IGF-I/IGF-IR 
system against V642I-APP, which is further antagonized by IGFBP-3, provides a 
molecular clue to the understanding of AD pathophysiology and to the 
establishment of potential therapy for AD.
