Febrile seizures are frequently accompanied by stress-induced hyperglycemia. 
Herein, we report the case of a 1.5-yr-old girl with hyperglycemia during 
febrile seizures who was subsequently diagnosed with glucokinase (GCK) 
maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), considering its distinction from 
stress hyperglycemia. Following the development of febrile seizures owing to 
adenovirus infection, the patient presented a casual blood glucose level was 185 
mg/dL. She had a multigenerational family history of diabetes and a hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.4%. Owing to the persistent glucose intolerance until the 
age of 5 years, genetic testing was performed, which revealed a heterozygous 
mutation in GCK, and the patient was diagnosed with GCK-MODY. Precise diagnosis 
of GCK-MODY individuals is important to avoid administering unnecessary 
antidiabetic medications. Even during hyperglycemia under stress, 
multigenerational diabetes and mildly elevated HbA1c levels can suggest 
GCK-MODY.
