The purpose of this review is to systematically examine the scientific evidence 
investigating selenium's relationship with COVID-19, aiming to support, or 
refute, the growing hypothesis that supplementation could prevent COVID-19 
etiopathogenesis. In fact, immediately after the beginning of the COVID-19 
pandemic, several speculative reviews suggested that selenium supplementation in 
the general population could act as a silver bullet to limit or even prevent the 
disease. Instead, a deep reading of the scientific reports on selenium and 
COVID-19 that are available to date supports neither the specific role of 
selenium in COVID-19 severity, nor the role of its supplementation in the 
prevention disease onset, nor its etiology.
