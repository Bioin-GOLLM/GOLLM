Chemically defined media for yeast cultivation (CDMY) were developed to support 
fast growth, experimental reproducibility, and quantitative analysis of growth 
rates and biomass yields. In addition to mineral salts and a carbon substrate, 
popular CDMYs contain seven to nine B-group vitamins, which are either enzyme 
cofactors or precursors for their synthesis. Despite the widespread use of CDMY 
in fundamental and applied yeast research, the relation of their design and 
composition to the actual vitamin requirements of yeasts has not been subjected 
to critical review since their first development in the 1940s. Vitamins are 
formally defined as essential organic molecules that cannot be synthesized by an 
organism. In yeast physiology, use of the term "vitamin" is primarily based on 
essentiality for humans, but the genome of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
reference strain S288C harbours most of the structural genes required for 
synthesis of the vitamins included in popular CDMY. Here, we review the 
biochemistry and genetics of the biosynthesis of these compounds by S. 
cerevisiae and, based on a comparative genomics analysis, assess the diversity 
within the Saccharomyces genus with respect to vitamin prototrophy.
