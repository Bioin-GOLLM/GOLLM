Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequently observed malignant gynecologic 
disease in developed countries. There is a strong association between the 
established risk factor obesity and the incidence of EC. Furthermore, the rate 
of women with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2 is increasing worldwide, 
correspondingly leading to a higher prevalence of EC. Understanding the adipose 
tissue as an endocrine organ, elementary pathophysiological pathways of 
tumorigenesis have been revealed. This includes the fundamental role of 
hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperestrogenemia, as well as 
interactions with a chronic proinflammatory microenvironment. Therapeutic 
options potentially include metformin or bariatric surgery. Moreover, changes in 
individual lifestyle such as weight reduction, physical activity, and an 
awareness of healthy nutrition are effective in preventing the disease.
