Mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is strongly associated with 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension. These disorders share 
underlying pathophysiology related to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that 
may be clinically insightful. In particular, activity of the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular 
disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection. Cardiovascular disease and 
pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels, which may increase the 
virulence of SARS-CoV-2 within the lung and heart. Conversely, mechanistic 
evidence from related coronaviruses suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection may 
downregulate ACE2, leading to toxic overaccumulation of angiotensin II that 
induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. RAS 
inhibition could mitigate this effect. With conflicting mechanistic evidence, we 
propose key clinical research priorities necessary to clarify the role of RAS 
inhibition in COVID-19 mortality that could be rapidly addressed by the 
international research community.
