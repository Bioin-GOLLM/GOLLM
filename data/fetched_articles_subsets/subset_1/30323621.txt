BACKGROUND: Radix Tetrastigma hemsleyani flavone (RTHF) is extracted from a 
traditional Chinese medicinal herb T. hemsleyani, which is conventionally used 
as a folk medicine for its anti-inflammation activity and antiviral activity. In 
this study, the effects of RTHF on inhibiting malignant biological properties in 
colorectal cancer (CRC) were evaluated by conducting both in vitro and in vivo 
experiments, and the underlying mechanism was investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry 
assays were performed to evaluate the proliferation of RTHF-treated colon tumor 
cells. Migration and invasion capacities were also tested by cell wound scratch 
assay and Transwell invasion assay. Moreover, the antitumor effects of RTHF on 
azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis-related CRC were 
investigated in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, Western blot and/or quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to evaluate 
the expressions of Lgr5, Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and E-cadherin.
RESULTS: These experiments showed that RTHF could decrease the cell growth 
kinetics and clone-forming capacity. RTHF could also dose dependently induce 
cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
process. Furthermore, downregulation of β-catenin activation and downstream 
protein expression were detected in CRC cells after being treated with RTHF. 
RTHF daily gavage suppressed the number and size of CRC in mice and inhibited 
Lgr5 and Cyclin D1 expressions in tumor tissue.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RTHF treatment inhibits colorectal tumor growth, 
decreases Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity, and downregulates target genes' 
expression.
