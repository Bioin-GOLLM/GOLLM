The phosphatase Rtr1 has been implicated in dephosphorylation of the RNA 
Polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD) during transcription elongation 
and in regulation of nuclear import of RNAPII. Although it has been shown that 
Rtr1 interacts with RNAPII in yeast and humans, the specific mechanisms that 
underlie Rtr1 recruitment to RNAPII have not been elucidated. To address this, 
we have performed an in-depth proteomic analysis of Rtr1 interacting proteins in 
yeast. Our studies revealed that hyperphosphorylated RNAPII is the primary 
interacting partner for Rtr1. To extend these findings, we performed 
quantitative proteomic analyses of Rtr1 interactions in yeast strains deleted 
for CTK1, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the CTD kinase I (CTDK-I) 
complex. Interestingly, we found that the interaction between Rtr1 and RNAPII is 
decreased in ctk1Î” strains. We hypothesize that serine-2 CTD phosphorylation is 
required for Rtr1 recruitment to RNAPII during transcription elongation.
