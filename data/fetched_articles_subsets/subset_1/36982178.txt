Protein glycosylation, including sialylation, involves complex and frequent 
post-translational modifications, which play a critical role in different 
biological processes. The conjugation of carbohydrate residues to specific 
molecules and receptors is critical for normal hematopoiesis, as it favors the 
proliferation and clearance of hematopoietic precursors. Through this mechanism, 
the circulating platelet count is controlled by the appropriate platelet 
production by megakaryocytes, and the kinetics of platelet clearance. Platelets 
have a half-life in blood ranging from 8 to 11 days, after which they lose the 
final sialic acid and are recognized by receptors in the liver and eliminated 
from the bloodstream. This favors the transduction of thrombopoietin, which 
induces megakaryopoiesis to produce new platelets. More than two hundred enzymes 
are responsible for proper glycosylation and sialylation. In recent years, novel 
disorders of glycosylation caused by molecular variants in multiple genes have 
been described. The phenotype of the patients with genetic alterations in GNE, 
SLC35A1, GALE and B4GALT is consistent with syndromic manifestations, severe 
inherited thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic complications.
