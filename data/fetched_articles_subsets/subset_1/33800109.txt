5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is an amino acid derivative and a precursor of 
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). The photophysical feature of PpIX is clinically used 
in photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These clinical 
applications are potentially based on in vitro cell culture experiments. Thus, 
conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro 5-ALA PDT 
experiments is meaningful and may provide opportunities to consider future 
perspectives in this field. We conducted a systematic literature search in 
PubMed to summarize the in vitro 5-ALA PDT experiments and calculated the 
effectiveness of 5-ALA PDT for several cancer cell types. In total, 412 articles 
were identified, and 77 were extracted based on our inclusion criteria. The 
calculated effectiveness of 5-ALA PDT was statistically analyzed, which revealed 
a tendency of cancer-classification-dependent sensitivity to 5-ALA PDT, and 
stomach cancer was significantly more sensitive to 5-ALA PDT compared with 
cancers of different origins. Based on our analysis, we suggest a standardized 
in vitro experimental protocol for 5-ALA PDT.
