The contribution of genetic factors to the memory is widely acknowledged. 
Research suggests that these factors include genes involved in the dopaminergic 
pathway, as well as the genes for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The activity of the products of 
these genes is affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 
genes. This study investigates the association between memory and SNPs in genes 
involved in the dopaminergic pathway, as well as in the BDNF and MTHFR genes, in 
a sample of healthy individuals. The sample includes 134 Taiwanese undergraduate 
volunteers of similar cognitive ability. The Chinese versions of the Wechsler 
Memory Scale (WMS-III) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) were 
employed. Our findings indicate that the BDNF Met66Val polymorphism and dopamine 
receptor D3 (DRD3) Ser9Gly polymorphism are associated significantly with 
long-term auditory memory. Further analysis detects no significant associations 
in the other polymorphisms and indices. Future replicated studies with larger 
sample sizes, and studies that consider different ethnic groups, are encouraged.
