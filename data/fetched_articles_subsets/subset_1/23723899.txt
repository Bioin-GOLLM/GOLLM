The mol-ecular conformation of the title compound, C41H29ClN4O3S, is stabilized 
by intra-molecular C-H⋯O and C-H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds. The thia-zole ring adopts an 
envelope conformation with the N atom as the flap, while the pyrrolidine ring 
has a twisted conformation on the N-C bond involving the spiro C atom. The β 
la-ctam ring makes dihedral angles of 39.74 (15) and 16.21 (16)° with the mean 
planes of the thia-zole and pyrrolidine rings, respectively. The thia-zole ring 
mean plane makes dihedral angles of 23.79 (13) and 70.88 (13) ° with the 
pyrrolidine and cyclo-pentane rings, respectively, while the pyrrolidine ring 
makes a dihedral angle of 85.63 (13)° with the cyclo-pentane ring. The O atom 
attached to the β la-ctam ring deviates from its mean plane by 0.040 (2) Å, 
while the O atom attached to the cyclo-pentane ring deviates from its mean plane 
by 0.132 (2) Å. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, 
forming chains along [010], and C-H⋯π and π-π inter-actions [centroid-centroid 
distance = 3.6928 (17) Å].
