In patients with atherosclerotic complications of diabetes, impaired 
neovascularization of ischemic tissue in the myocardium and lower limb limits 
the ability of these tissues to compensate for poor perfusion. We identified 10 
novel insulin-regulated genes, among them Adm, Cited2, and Ctgf, which were 
downregulated in endothelial cells by insulin through FoxO1. 
CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail 2 (CITED2), which was 
downregulated by insulin by up to 54%, is an important negative regulator of 
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and impaired HIF signaling is a key mechanism 
underlying the impairment of angiogenesis in diabetes. Consistent with 
impairment of vascular insulin action, CITED2 was increased in cardiac 
endothelial cells from mice with diet-induced obesity and from db/db mice and 
was 3.8-fold higher in arterial tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes than 
control subjects without diabetes. CITED2 knockdown promoted endothelial tube 
formation and endothelial cell proliferation, whereas CITED2 overexpression 
impaired HIF activity in vitro. After femoral artery ligation, induction of an 
endothelial-specific HIF target gene in hind limb muscle was markedly 
upregulated in mice with endothelial cell deletion of CITED2, suggesting that 
CITED2 can limit HIF activity in vivo. We conclude that vascular insulin 
resistance in type 2 diabetes contributes to the upregulation of CITED2, which 
impairs HIF signaling and endothelial proangiogenic function.
