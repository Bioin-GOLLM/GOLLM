BACKGROUND: We have recently found a phenomenon that spontaneous regeneration of 
a hyaline cartilage-like tissue can be induced in a large osteochondral defect 
by implanting a double-network (DN) hydrogel plug, which was composed of 
poly-(2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) and poly-(N, N'-Dimetyl 
acrylamide), at the bottom of the defect. The purpose of this study was to 
clarify gene expression profile of the regenerated tissue in comparison with 
that of the normal articular cartilage.
METHODS: We created a cylindrical osteochondral defect in the rabbit femoral 
grooves. Then, we implanted the DN gel plug at the bottom of the defect. At 2 
and 4 weeks after surgery, the regenerated tissue was analyzed using DNA 
microarray and immunohistochemical examinations.
RESULTS: The gene expression profiles of the regenerated tissues were 
macroscopically similar to the normal cartilage, but showed some minor 
differences. The expression degree of COL2A1, COL1A2, COL10A1, DCN, FMOD, SPARC, 
FLOD2, CHAD, CTGF, and COMP genes was greater in the regenerated tissue than in 
the normal cartilage. The top 30 genes that expressed 5 times or more in the 
regenerated tissue as compared with the normal cartilage included type-2 
collagen, type-10 collagen, FN, vimentin, COMP, EF1alpha, TFCP2, and GAPDH 
genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The tissue regenerated by using the DN gel was genetically similar 
but not completely identical to articular cartilage. The genetic data shown in 
this study are useful for future studies to identify specific genes involved in 
spontaneous cartilage regeneration.
