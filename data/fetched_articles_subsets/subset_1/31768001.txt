Imaging techniques for quantifying changes in the hierarchical structure of 
deforming joints are constrained by destructive sample treatments, sample-size 
restrictions and lengthy scan times. Here, we report the use of fast low-dose 
pink-beam synchrotron X-ray tomography in combination with mechanical loading at 
nanometric precision for in situ imaging, at resolutions below 100â€‰nm, of the 
mechanical strain in intact untreated joints under physiologically realistic 
conditions. We show that in young, older and osteoarthritic mice, hierarchical 
changes in tissue structure and mechanical behaviour can be simultaneously 
visualized, and that the tissue structure at the cellular level correlates with 
the mechanical performance of the whole joint. We also use the tomographic 
approach to study the colocalization of tissue strains to specific chondrocyte 
lacunar organizations within intact loaded joints and to explore the role of 
calcified-cartilage stiffness on the biomechanics of healthy and pathological 
joints.
