OBJECTIVES: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common skeletal 
disorder. This study was conducted to demonstrate the association between DDH 
and a polymorphism rs9277935 of COL11A2 gene.
RESULTS: A significant difference in genotype distribution in a recessive model 
(TT+GT vs. GG) between two groups (P=0.017) was demonstrated. Analysis in female 
patients showed significantly greater frequency of minor allele G(0.49 vs. 0.43, 
p=0.024) and significantly higher distribution of GG genotype (p=0.006). DDH 
patients were found to have significantly lower COL11A2 expression than 
controls. Moreover, DDH patients with rs9277935 genotype TT have a significantly 
increased expression of COL11A2 than those with genotype GG. COL11A2 
demonstrated chondrogenic properties in vitro.
CONCLUSION: Polymorphism rs9277935 of gene COL11A2 is a functional variant 
regulating the expression and the chondrogenic properties of COL11A2 in DDH in 
Chinese Han population.
METHODS: A case-control candidate gene association study was conducted in 945 
patients (350 radiologically confirmed DDH patients and 595 healthy controls). 
Difference of COL11A2 expression in hip joint tissue was compared between the 
patients and the controls. Allelic difference in Col11a2 expression by rs9277935 
was assessed with luciferase activity. Chondrogenic effects of Col11a2 signaling 
on BMSCs were also determined in vitro.
