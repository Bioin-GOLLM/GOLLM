Given the immune system's importance for cancer surveillance and treatment, we 
have investigated how it may be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection of cancer 
patients. Across some heterogeneity in tumor type, stage, and treatment, 
virus-exposed solid cancer patients display a dominant impact of SARS-CoV-2, 
apparent from the resemblance of their immune signatures to those for COVID-19+ 
non-cancer patients. This is not the case for hematological malignancies, with 
virus-exposed patients collectively displaying heterogeneous humoral responses, 
an exhausted T cell phenotype and a high prevalence of prolonged virus shedding. 
Furthermore, while recovered solid cancer patients' immunophenotypes resemble 
those of non-virus-exposed cancer patients, recovered hematological cancer 
patients display distinct, lingering immunological legacies. Thus, while solid 
cancer patients, including those with advanced disease, seem no more at risk of 
SARS-CoV-2-associated immune dysregulation than the general population, 
hematological cancer patients show complex immunological consequences of 
SARS-CoV-2 exposure that might usefully inform their care.
