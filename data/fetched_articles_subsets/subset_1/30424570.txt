Genome stability requires tight regulation of DNA replication to ensure that the 
entire genome of the cell is duplicated once and only once per cell cycle. In 
mammalian cells, origin activation is controlled in space and time by a 
cell-specific and robust program called replication timing. About 100,000 
potential replication origins form on the chromatin in the gap 1 (G1) phase but 
only 20⁻30% of them are active during the DNA replication of a given cell in the 
synthesis (S) phase. When the progress of replication forks is slowed by 
exogenous or endogenous impediments, the cell must activate some of the inactive 
or "dormant" origins to complete replication on time. Thus, the many origins 
that may be activated are probably key to protect the genome against replication 
stress. This review aims to discuss the role of these dormant origins as 
safeguards of the human genome during replicative stress.
