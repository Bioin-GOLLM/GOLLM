Members of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family recognize intracellular pathogens 
and recruit a variety of effector molecules, including pro-caspases and kinases, 
which in turn are implicated in cytokine processing and NF-kappaB activation.In 
order to elucidate the intricate network of NLR signaling, which is still 
fragmentary in molecular terms, we applied comprehensive yeast two-hybrid 
analysis for unbiased evaluation of physical interactions between NLRs and their 
adaptors (ASC, CARD8) as well as kinase RIPK2 and inflammatory caspases (C1, C2, 
C4, C5) under identical conditions. Our results confirmed the interaction of 
NOD1 and NOD2 with RIPK2, and between NLRP3 and ASC, but most importantly, our 
studies revealed hitherto unrecognized interactions of NOD2 with members of the 
NLRP subfamily. We found that NOD2 specifically and directly interacts with 
NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRP12. Furthermore, we observed homodimerization of the RIPK2 
CARD domains and identified residues in NOD2 critical for interaction with 
RIPK2.In conclusion, our work provides further evidence for the complex network 
of protein-protein interactions underlying NLR function.
