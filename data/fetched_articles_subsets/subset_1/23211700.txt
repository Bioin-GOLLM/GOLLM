Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by development abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and childhood 
cancers. Compelling evidence indicates a common genetic basis for FA and 
breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility. Recently, biallelic germ-line mutations in 
SLX4 have been demonstrated to cause a previously unknown FA subtype (FA-P). We 
address the role of SLX4/FANCP in breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility by 
conducting a comprehensive mutation scanning in 486 index cases from 
non-BRCA1/BRCA2 multiple-case breast and/or ovarian cancer families (non-BRCA1/2 
families) from Spain. We detected one unequivocal loss-of-function mutation 
(p.Glu1517X). In addition, one missense change (p.Arg372Trp) predicted to be 
pathogenic by in silico analysis co-segregates with disease in one family. 
Overall, the study indicates that SLX4 mutation screening will have a very low 
impact (if any) in the genetic counseling of non-BRCA1/2 families.
