Different types of DNA damages caused by ionizing radiation may enhance the 
cancer risk in exposed individuals. Inherited variations in DNA repair genes 
cause the inter-individual variability in response to ionizing radiation. The 
purpose of this study was to determine the association between single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) of two important DNA repair genes (XRCC1 R399Q and XRCC3 
T241M) and the level of DNA damage investigated by micronucleus (MN) frequency 
in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 120 industrial radiographers (IR) and 120 
non-exposed control individuals. The frequencies of MN and nucleoplasmic bridges 
were significantly higher in the IR group than in the control group 
(33.83 ± 11.96 vs. 7.47 ± 2.96, p < 0.0001 and 1.69 ± 1.86 vs. 0.12 ± 0.33, 
p < 0.0001). MN frequencies in the IR group were associated with the cumulative 
radiation doses (p < 0.0001, r = 0.58 for last 1 year of exposure and 
p < 0.0001, r = 0.67 for last 5 years of exposure). Polymorphism of XRCC3 T241M 
was associated with higher MN frequencies in the IR group. However, the same 
result was not observed between XRCC3 SNP and MN frequency in the control group. 
Consequently, XRCC3 241Met alleles may cause the increased DNA damage in the 
industrial radiographers.
