BACKGROUND: Proteasome subunit beta type 1 (PSMB1) rs12717 polymorphism, a 
single nucleotide polymorphism with unknown functional effect, was recently 
reported to influence response to bortezomib-based therapy in follicular 
lymphoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the prognostic impact of this 
polymorphism in 211 consecutively diagnosed multiple myeloma cases, and 
performed in vitro experiments to look into its functional consequences.
RESULTS: On univariate analysis, patients carrying the variant G allele showed 
significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) with a pattern suggestive 
of a gene-dose effect (PFS 26.4, 22.3, and 16.4 months in C/C, C/G, and G/G 
patients, respectively, P = .002). On multivariate analysis, carrying the G/G 
genotype was a significant independent risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio 
[HR] 2.29, P < .001) with a similar trend in C/G carriers (HR 1.33, P = .097) 
when compared with the major allele carrier C/C cohort. Our subsequent in vitro 
analyses demonstrated significantly reduced protease activity in proteasomes of 
individuals with G/G genotype compared with that of C/C carriers, despite that 
PSMB1 expression and proteasome assembly remained unaltered. Bortezomib 
exhibited a lower inhibitory capacity on the caspase- and trypsin-like activity 
of proteasomes from G/G individuals.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that carriership of PSMB1 rs12717 minor allele is 
predictive for suboptimal response with bortezomib treatment, which could be 
explained by less active proteasomes that are less sensitive to bortezomib, and 
myeloma cells consequently relying on other escape mechanisms to cope with the 
abundance of misfolded proteins.
