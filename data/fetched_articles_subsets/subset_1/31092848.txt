F1-ATPase is a rotary motor protein in which the central γ-subunit rotates 
inside the cylinder made of α3β3 subunits. To investigate interactions between 
the γ shaft and the cylinder at the molecular scale, load was imposed on γ 
through a polystyrene bead by three-dimensional optical trapping in the 
direction along which the shaft penetrates the cylinder. Pull-out event was 
observed under high-load, and thus load-dependency of lifetime of the 
interaction was estimated. Notably, accumulated counts of lifetime were 
comprised of fast and slow components. Both components exponentially dropped 
with imposed loads, suggesting that the binding energy is compensated by the 
work done by optical trapping. Because the mutant, in which the half of the 
shaft was deleted, showed only one fast component in the bond lifetime, the slow 
component is likely due to the native interaction mode held by multiple 
interfaces.
