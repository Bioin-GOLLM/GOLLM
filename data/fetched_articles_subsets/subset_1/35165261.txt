Retinal neurodegeneration develops early in the course of diabetic retinopathy 
(DR), and our previous research showed that succinate accumulation results in 
retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) dysfunction in the retinas of rats with DR. 
Succinate can enhance lysine succinylation, but the succinylation of DR is not 
well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of the succinylome in 
DR and identified the key factor in this process. TMT labeling and LC-MS/MS 
analysis were combined to quantify the differentially succinylated proteins 
between vitreous humor (VH) samples from DR and non-DR patients. A total of 74 
sites in 35 proteins were differentially succinylated between DR and non-DR 
vitreous humor samples, among which succinylation of the K108 site of optineurin 
(OPTN K108su) in the defense response was enriched by GO analysis based on the 
biological process category. Then, using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic 
rat model, R28 cells and primary rat RGCs (rRGCs), we demonstrated that OPTN 
underwent lysine succinylation in the retinas of rats with DR and that OPTN 
K108su mediated autophagic flux blockade under high-glucose (HG) conditions. 
Sirt5 can desuccinylate OPTN K108su, thus protecting RGCs function from high 
glucose-induced RGCs autophagic flux blockade in the diabetic retina. Overall, 
desuccinylation of OPTN is an essential adaptive mechanism for ameliorating 
autophagic flux blockade in RGCs under DR conditions, and targeting the 
Sirt5-desuccK108-OPTN axis may thus open an avenue for therapeutic intervention 
in RCGs dysfunction.
