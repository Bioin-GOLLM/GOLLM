Correct assembly of thin filaments composed of actin and actin-binding proteins 
is of crucial importance for properly functioning muscle cells. Tropomyosin 
(Tpm) mediates the binding of tropomodulin (Tmod) and leiomodin (Lmod) at the 
slow-growing, or pointed, ends of the thin filaments. Together these proteins 
regulate thin filament lengths and actin dynamics in cardiac muscle. The K15N 
mutation in the TPM1 gene is associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy 
(DCM) but the effect of this mutation on Tpm's function is unknown. In this 
study, we introduced the K15N mutation in striated muscle α-Tpm (Tpm1.1) and 
investigated its interaction with actin, Tmod and Lmod. The mutation caused a 
∼3-fold decrease in the affinity of Tpm1.1 for actin. The binding of Lmod and 
Tmod to Tpm1.1-covered actin filaments also decreased in the presence of the 
K15N mutation. Furthermore, the K15N mutation in Tpm1.1 disrupted the inhibition 
of actin polymerization and affected the competition between Tmod1 and Lmod2 for 
binding at the pointed ends. Our data demonstrate that the K15N mutation alters 
pointed end dynamics by affecting molecular interactions between Tpm1.1, Lmod2 
and Tmod1.
