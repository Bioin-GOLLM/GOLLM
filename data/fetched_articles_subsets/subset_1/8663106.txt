The properties of two mutant PriA proteins, PriA C439Y and PriA C445Y have been 
used to reveal the role of PriB during assembly of the phiX174-type primosome. 
The replication defects of both mutant PriA proteins could be rescued by high 
concentrations of DnaT. Analysis of the formation of intermediate complexes in 
primosome assembly and the effect of PriB on PriA binding to DNA demonstrated 
that the mutant PriA proteins could not form a PriA-PriB complex on DNA carrying 
a primosome assembly site. Consequently, the mutant proteins also could not form 
PriA-PriB-DnaT complexes at concentrations of DnaT sufficient to form such a 
complex with wild-type PriA. In addition, PriB was found to stabilize wild-type 
but not mutant PriA proteins on DNA. At high concentrations of DnaT, both mutant 
and wild-type PriA proteins could form a PriA-DnaT complex and support 
PriB-independent phiX174 complementary strand DNA replication. Thus, during 
primosome assembly, PriB facilitates complex formation between PriA and DnaT.
