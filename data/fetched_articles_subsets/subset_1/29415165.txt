Single gene defects that impair lymphocyte cytotoxicity can predispose to severe 
viral infection that normally remains subclinical. The classic severe 
presentation is hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Here, we report the case of 
a neonate who presented with cytomegalovirus palatal ulceration and bocavirus 
pneumonitis secondary to impaired cytotoxicity caused by biallelic mutations in 
the UNC13D gene.
