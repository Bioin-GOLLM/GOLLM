Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is caused by infections with intracellular parasites 
of the Leishmania Viannia subgenus, including Leishmania guyanensis. The 
pathology develops after parasite dissemination to nasopharyngeal tissues, where 
destructive metastatic lesions form with chronic inflammation. Currently, the 
mechanisms involved in lesion development are poorly understood. Here we show 
that metastasizing parasites have a high Leishmania RNA virus-1 (LRV1) burden 
that is recognized by the host Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) to induce 
proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Paradoxically, these TLR3-mediated 
immune responses rendered mice more susceptible to infection, and the animals 
developed an increased footpad swelling and parasitemia. Thus, LRV1 in the 
metastasizing parasites subverted the host immune response to Leishmania and 
promoted parasite persistence.
