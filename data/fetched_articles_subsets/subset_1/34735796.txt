Biofilms are community architectures adopted by bacteria inclusive of a 
self-formed extracellular matrix that protects resident bacteria from diverse 
environmental stresses and, in many species, incorporates extracellular DNA 
(eDNA) and DNABII proteins for structural integrity throughout biofilm 
development. Here, we present evidence that this eDNA-based architecture relies 
on the rare Z-form. Z-form DNA accumulates as biofilms mature and, through 
stabilization by the DNABII proteins, confers structural integrity to the 
biofilm matrix. Indeed, substances known to drive B-DNA into Z-DNA promoted 
biofilm formation whereas those that drive Z-DNA into B-DNA disrupted extant 
biofilms. Importantly, we demonstrated that the universal bacterial DNABII 
family of proteins stabilizes both bacterial- and host-eDNA in the Z-form in 
situ. A model is proposed that incorporates the role of Z-DNA in biofilm 
pathogenesis, innate immune response, and immune evasion.
