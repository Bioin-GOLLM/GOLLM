Pancreatic cancer (PC) is featured with low survival rate and poor outcomes. 
Herein, we found that the expression of caspase-recruitment domain-containing 
protein 9 (CARD9), predominantly expressed in innate immune cells, was 
positively related to the prognosis of PC patients. CARD9-deficient PC mice 
exhibited rapider cancer progression and poorer survival rate. CARD9 knockout 
decreased dendritic cell (DC) maturation and impaired DC ability to activate T 
cells in vivo and in vitro. Adoptive DC transfer confirmed that the role of 
CARD9 deficiency in PC relied on DCs. Creatine was identified as the most 
significant differential metabolite between WT DCs and CARD9-/- DCs wherein it 
played an essential role in maintaining DC maturation and function. CARD9 
deficiency led to decreased creatine levels in DCs by inhibiting the 
transcription of the creatine-specific transporter, solute carrier family 6 
member 8 (SLC6A8). Furtherly, CARD9 deletion blocked p65 activation by 
abolishing the formation of CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex, which prevented the 
binding between p65 and SLC6A8 promoter. These events decreased the creatine 
transport into DCs, and led to DC immaturity and impairment in antitumor 
immunity, consequently promoting PC progression.
