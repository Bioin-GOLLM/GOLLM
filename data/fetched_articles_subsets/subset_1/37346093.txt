BACKGROUND: Early investigations linking language and genetics were focused on 
the evolution of human communication in populations with developmental speech 
and language disorders. Recently, studies suggest that genes may also modulate 
recovery from post-stroke aphasia.
AIMS: Our goal is to review current literature related to the influence of 
genetics on post-stroke recovery, and the implications for aphasia 
rehabilitation. We describe candidate genes implicated by empirical findings and 
address additional clinical considerations.
MAIN CONTRIBUTION: We describe existing evidence and mechanisms supporting 
future investigations into how genetic factors may modulate aphasia recovery and 
propose that two candidate genes, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 
apolipoprotein E (APOE), may be important considerations for future research 
assessing response to aphasia treatment. Evidence suggests that BDNF is 
important for learning, memory, and neuroplasticity. APOE influences cognitive 
functioning and memory in older individuals and has also been implicated in 
neural repair. Moreover, recent data suggest an interaction between specific 
alleles of the BDNF and APOE genes in influencing episodic memory.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic influences on recovery from aphasia have been largely 
unexplored in the literature despite evidence that genetic factors influence 
behaviour and recovery from brain injury. As researchers continue to explore 
prognostic factors that may influence response to aphasia treatment, it is time 
for genetic factors to be considered as a source of variability. As the field 
moves in the direction of personalized medicine, eventually allied health 
professionals may utilize genetic profiles to inform treatment decisions and 
education for patients and care partners.
