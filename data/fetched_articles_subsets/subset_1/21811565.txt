In oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs), an enzyme which has been extensively studied 
as a target for hypocholesterolemic or antifungal drugs, a lipophilic channel 
connects the surface of the protein with the active site cavity. Active site and 
channel are separated by a narrow constriction operating as a mobile gate for 
the substrate passage. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae OSC, two aminoacidic residues 
of the channel/constriction apparatus, Ala525 and Glu526, were previously showed 
as critical for maintaining the enzyme functionality. In this work sixteen novel 
mutants, each bearing a substitution at or around the channel constrictions, 
were tested for their enzymatic activity. Modelling studies showed that the most 
functionality-lowering substitutions deeply alter the H-bond network involving 
the channel/constriction apparatus. A rotation of Tyr239 is proposed as part of 
the mechanism permitting the access of the substrate to the active site. The 
inhibition of OSC by squalene was used as a tool for understanding whether the 
residues under study are involved in a pre-catalytic selection and docking of 
the substrate oxidosqualene.
