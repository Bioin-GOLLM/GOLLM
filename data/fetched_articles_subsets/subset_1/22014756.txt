Two new marine-derived sesquiterpene benzoquinones which we designate as 
neopetrosiquinones A (1) and B (2), have been isolated from a deep-water sponge 
of the family Petrosiidae. The structures were elucidated on the basis of their 
spectroscopic data. Compounds 1 and 2 inhibit the in vitro proliferation of the 
DLD-1 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line with IC(50) values of 3.7 and 
9.8 μM, respectively, and the PANC-1 human pancreatic carcinoma cell line with 
IC(50) values of 6.1 and 13.8 μM, respectively. Neopetrosiquinone A (1) also 
inhibited the in vitro proliferation of the AsPC-1 human pancreatic carcinoma 
cell line with an IC(50) value of 6.1 μM. The compounds are structurally related 
to alisiaquinone A, cyclozonarone, and xestoquinone.
