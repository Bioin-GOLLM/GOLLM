Interstitial microdeletions at chromosome 19p13.3 are frequently associated with 
a constellation of clinical features including macrocephaly, characteristic 
face, intellectual disability, and sleep apnea. Previous studies in 25 patients 
with 19p13.3 microdeletions have revealed loss of MAP2K2 in 24 patients and that 
of PIAS4 and ZBTB7A in 23 patients, suggesting that these three adjacent genes 
are candidate genes for the phenotypic development in 19p13.3 microdeletions. We 
identified a de novo likely pathogenic heterozygous missense variant of ZBTB7A 
(NM_015898.3:c.1152C>G, p.(Cys384Trp)) in a Japanese boy with macrocephaly, 
intellectual disability, and sleep apnea. This variant affects the conserved 
cysteine residue forming the coordinate bond with Zn2+ ion at the first zinc 
finger domain, and is predicted to exert a dominant-negative effect because of 
the generation of homo- and hetero-dimers with the wild-type and variant ZBTB7A 
proteins. The results argue for a critical relevance of ZBTB7A to the 
development of most, but probably not all, of the 19p13.3 microdeletion 
phenotype.
