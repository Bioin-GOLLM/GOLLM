The genome of the Halomonas elongata type strain DSM 2581, an industrial 
producer, was reevaluated using the Illumina HiSeq2500 technology. To resolve 
duplication-associated ambiguities, PCR products were generated and sequenced. 
Outside of duplications, 72 sequence corrections were required, of which 24 were 
point mutations and 48 were indels of one or few bases. Most of these were 
associated with polynucleotide stretches (poly-T stretch overestimated in 19 
cases, poly-C underestimated in 15 cases). These problems may be attributed to 
using 454 technology for original genome sequencing. On average, the original 
genome sequence had only one error in 56 kb. There were 23 frameshift error 
corrections in the 29 protein-coding genes affected by sequence revision. The 
genome has been subjected to major reannotation in order to substantially 
increase the annotation quality.
