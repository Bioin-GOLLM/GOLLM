The transcription factors Batf3 and IRF8 are required for the development of 
CD8α(+) conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), but the basis for their actions has 
remained unclear. Here we identified two progenitor cells positive for the 
transcription factor Zbtb46 that separately generated CD8α(+) cDCs and CD4(+) 
cDCs and arose directly from the common DC progenitor (CDP). Irf8 expression in 
CDPs required prior autoactivation of Irf8 that was dependent on the 
transcription factor PU.1. Specification of the clonogenic progenitor of CD8α(+) 
cDCs (the pre-CD8 DC) required IRF8 but not Batf3. However, after specification 
of pre-CD8 DCs, autoactivation of Irf8 became Batf3 dependent at a CD8α(+) 
cDC-specific enhancer with multiple transcription factor AP1-IRF composite 
elements (AICEs) within the Irf8 superenhancer. CDPs from Batf3(-/-) mice that 
were specified toward development into pre-CD8 DCs failed to complete their 
development into CD8α(+) cDCs due to decay of Irf8 autoactivation and diverted 
to the CD4(+) cDC lineage.
