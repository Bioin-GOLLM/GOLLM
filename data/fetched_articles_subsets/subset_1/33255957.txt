Cryptosporidiumparvum is a clinically important eukaryotic parasite that causes 
the disease cryptosporidiosis, which manifests with gastroenteritis-like 
symptoms. The protist has mitosomes, which are organelles of mitochondrial 
origin that have only been partially characterized. The genome encodes a highly 
reduced set of transport proteins of the SLC25 mitochondrial carrier family of 
unknown function. Here, we have studied the transport properties of one member 
of the C. parvum carrier family, demonstrating that it resembles the 
mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier of eukaryotes. However, this carrier has a broader 
substrate specificity for nucleotides, transporting adenosine, thymidine, and 
uridine di- and triphosphates in contrast to its mitochondrial orthologues, 
which have a strict substrate specificity for ADP and ATP. Inspection of the 
putative translocation pathway highlights a cysteine residue, which is a serine 
in mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers. When the serine residue is replaced by 
cysteine or larger hydrophobic residues in the yeast mitochondrial ADP/ATP 
carrier, the substrate specificity becomes broad, showing that this residue is 
important for nucleotide base selectivity in ADP/ATP carriers.
