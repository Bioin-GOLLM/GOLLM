BACKGROUND: X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is a progressive hereditary 
nephropathy caused by mutations in the type IV collagen alpha chain 5 gene 
(COL4A5). Although many COL4A5 mutations have previously been identified, 
pathogenic synonymous mutations have not yet been described.
METHODS: A family with XLAS underwent mutational analyses of COL4A5 by PCR and 
direct sequencing, as well as transcript analysis of potential splice site 
mutations. In silico analysis was also conducted to predict the disruption of 
splicing factor binding sites. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of kidney biopsies was 
used to detect α2 and α5 chain expression.
RESULTS: We identified a hemizygous point mutation, c.876A>T, in exon 15 of 
COL4A5 in the proband and his brother, which is predicted to result in a 
synonymous amino acid change, p.(Gly292Gly). Transcript analysis showed that 
this mutation potentially altered splicing because it disrupted the splicing 
factor binding site. The kidney biopsy of the proband showed lamellation of the 
glomerular basement membrane (GBM), while IHC revealed negative α5(IV) staining 
in the GBM and Bowman's capsule, which is typical of XLAS.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a synonymous COL4A5 substitution being 
responsible for XLAS. Our findings suggest that transcript analysis should be 
conducted for the future correct assessment of silent mutations.
