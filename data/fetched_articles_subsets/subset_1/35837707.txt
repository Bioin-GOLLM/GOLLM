PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Giant cell tumors of bone (GCTB) are intermediate, locally 
aggressive primary bone tumors. For conventional GCTB, surgery remains treatment 
of choice. For advanced GCTB, a more important role came into play for systemic 
therapy including denosumab and bisphosphonates over the last decade.
RECENT FINDINGS: In diagnostics, focus has been on H3F3A (G34) driver mutations 
present in GCTB. The most frequent mutation (G34W) can be detected using 
immunohistochemistry and is highly specific in differentiating GCTB from other 
giant cell containing tumors. PD-L1 expression can be used as biological marker 
to predict higher recurrence risks in GCTB patients.The use of 
bisphosphonate-loaded bone cement is under investigation in a randomized 
controlled trial. A new technique consisting of percutaneous microwave ablation 
and bisphosphonate-loaded polymethylmethacrylate cementoplasty was proposed for 
unresectable (pelvic) GCTB.Increased experience with use of denosumab raised 
concern on elevated recurrence rates. However, conclusions of meta-analyses 
should be interpreted with risk of indication bias in mind. Several small 
studies are published with short-course denosumab (varying from 3 to 6 doses). 
One small trial directly compared denosumab and zoledronic acid, with no 
statistical differences in radiological and clinical outcome, and 
nonsignificantly higher recurrence rate after denosumab. As bisphosphonates 
directly target neoplastic stromal cells in GCTB, larger directly comparative 
trials are still warranted.
SUMMARY: Neoadjuvant denosumab is highly effective for advanced GCTB, and a 
short-course is advised to facilitate surgery, whereas increased recurrence 
rates remain of concern. Randomized controlled trials are conducted on 
bisphosphonate-loaded bone cement and on optimal dose and duration of 
neoadjuvant denosumab. PD-L1 could be a potential new therapy target in GCTB.
