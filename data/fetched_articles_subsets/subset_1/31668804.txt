Current approaches to reducing the latent HIV reservoir entail first 
reactivating virus-containing cells to become visible to the immune system. A 
critical second step is killing these cells to reduce reservoir size. Endogenous 
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) may not be adequate because of cellular 
exhaustion and the evolution of CTL-resistant viruses. We have designed a 
universal CAR-T cell platform based on CTLs engineered to bind a variety of 
broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. We show that this platform, 
convertibleCAR-T cells, effectively kills HIV-infected, but not uninfected, CD4 
T cells from blood, tonsil, or spleen and only when armed with anti-HIV 
antibodies. convertibleCAR-T cells also kill within 48 h more than half of the 
inducible reservoir found in blood of HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral 
therapy. The modularity of convertibleCAR-T cell system, which allows 
multiplexing with several anti-HIV antibodies yielding greater breadth and 
control, makes it a promising tool for attacking the latent HIV reservoir.
