BACKGROUND: There is a marked variation in clinical phenotypes that have been 
associated with mutations in FKRP, ranging from severe congenital muscular 
dystrophies to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I).
METHODS: We screened the FKRP gene in two cohorts totaling 87 patients with the 
LGMD phenotype.
RESULTS: The c.826C>A, p.L276I mutation was present in six patients and a 
compound heterozygote mutation in a seventh patient. Six patients had a mild 
LGMD2I phenotype, which resembles that of Becker muscular dystrophy. The other 
patient had onset before the age of 3 years, and thus may follow a more severe 
course.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that LGMD2I may be common in certain North 
American populations. This diagnosis should be considered early in the 
evaluation of LGMD.
