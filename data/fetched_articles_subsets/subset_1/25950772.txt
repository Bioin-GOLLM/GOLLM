Ras genes are frequently activated in human cancers, but the mutant Ras proteins 
remain largely "undruggable" through the conventional small-molecule approach 
owing to the absence of any obvious binding pockets on their surfaces. By 
screening a combinatorial peptide library, followed by structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) analysis, we discovered a family of cyclic peptides 
possessing both Ras-binding and cell-penetrating properties. These 
cell-permeable cyclic peptides inhibit Ras signaling by binding to Ras-GTP and 
blocking its interaction with downstream proteins and they induce apoptosis of 
cancer cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of developing cyclic 
peptides for the inhibition of intracellular protein-protein interactions and of 
direct Ras inhibitors as a novel class of anticancer agents.
