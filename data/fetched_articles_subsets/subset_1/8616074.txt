Although mutations of the p53 tumour-suppressor gene have been observed 
occasionally in the advanced stages of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), they 
have not been detected in early refractory anaemia (RA) or RA with ring 
sideroblasts phases. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and 
direct sequencing, we searched for p53 mutations in a patient who progressed 
from RA to overt leukaemia. A p53 mutation at codon 249 (AGG to ATG) was 
observed in RA, RA with excess of blasts in transformation and overt leukaemia. 
We describe a case of MDS with p53 mutation at codon 249 detected in the RA 
phase.
