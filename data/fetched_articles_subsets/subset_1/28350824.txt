Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) is a complex multi-organ disease resulting from 
total body exposure to high doses of radiation. Individuals can be exposed to 
total body irradiation (TBI) in a number of ways, including terrorist 
radiological weapons or nuclear accidents. In order to determine whether an 
individual has been exposed to high doses of radiation and needs countermeasure 
treatment, robust biomarkers are needed to estimate radiation exposure from 
biospecimens such as blood or urine. In order to identity such candidate 
biomarkers of radiation exposure, high-resolution proteomics was used to analyze 
plasma from non-human primates following whole body irradiation (Co-60 at 6.7 Gy 
and 7.4 Gy) with a twelve day observation period. A total of 663 proteins were 
evaluated from the plasma proteome analysis. A panel of plasma proteins with 
characteristic time- and dose-dependent changes was identified. In addition to 
the plasma proteomics study reported here, we recently identified candidate 
biomarkers using urine from these same non-human primates. From the proteomic 
analysis of both plasma and urine, we identified ten overlapping proteins that 
significantly differentiate both time and dose variables. These shared plasma 
and urine proteins represent optimal candidate biomarkers of radiation exposure.
