Fooling enzymes with mock amides: Analogues of apicidin, a cyclic-tetrapeptide 
inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), were designed with a 1,4- or 
1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole in place of a backbone amide bond to fix the 
bond in question in either a trans-like or a cis-like configuration. Thus, the 
binding affinity of distinct peptide conformations (see picture) could be 
probed. One analogue proved in some cases to be superior to apicidin as an HDAC 
inhibitor.
