Amino acids are integral components of cancer metabolism. The non-essential 
amino acid asparagine supports the growth and survival of various cancer cell 
types. Here, different mass spectrometry approaches were employed to identify 
lower aspartate levels, higher aspartate/glutamine ratios and lower 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolite levels in asparagine-deprived sarcoma 
cells. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide hydride (NADH) ratios were consistent with redirection of TCA cycle 
flux and relative electron acceptor deficiency. Elevated lactate/pyruvate ratios 
may be due to compensatory NAD+ regeneration through increased pyruvate to 
lactate conversion by lactate dehydrogenase. Supplementation with exogenous 
pyruvate, which serves as an electron acceptor, restored aspartate levels, 
NAD+/NADH ratios, lactate/pyruvate ratios and cell growth in asparagine-deprived 
cells. Chemicals disrupting NAD+ regeneration in the electron transport chain 
further enhanced the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of asparagine 
depletion. We speculate that reductive stress may be a major contributor to the 
growth arrest observed in asparagine-starved cells.
