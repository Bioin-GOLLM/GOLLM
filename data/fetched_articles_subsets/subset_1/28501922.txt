PURPOSE: The consumption of Brazil nuts has been associated with benefits to 
lipid metabolism and reductions in total cholesterol and LDL concentrations. 
They are the richest natural source of selenium which has essential functions in 
human physiology. Genetic polymorphisms in Selenoprotein P could impair lipid 
and glucose metabolisms. The aim of this work was to verify the influence of 
polymorphisms in genes for selenoproteins on blood lipid levels after dietary 
supplementation with Brazil nuts in healthy adults.
METHODS: The study included 130 healthy volunteers selected at the University of 
São Paulo, Brazil. They were supplemented with one nut a day for 8 weeks, 
followed by 8 weeks without intervention. The following analyses were performed: 
anthropometric measurements, serum fasting glucose, lipid profile, C-reactive 
protein and plasma MDA levels. The volunteers were genotyped for SNPs rs1050450, 
rs3811699, rs1800699, rs713041, rs3877899, rs7579, rs34713741, and rs5845 in 
genes for selenoproteins.
RESULTS: The concentrations of total cholesterol and fasting glucose levels 
decreased after 8 weeks of supplementation (p < 0.05). Glucose levels were 
modulated by rs3877899 in SEPP1, with significantly lower levels observed for 
individuals with the GA + AA genotype (p = 0.025). In addition, rs7579 was 
associated with cholesterol concentrations, which were significantly lower for 
individuals with the GG genotype (p = 0.053).
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with one Brazil nut a day for 8 weeks reduced total 
cholesterol and glucose levels. Furthermore, our results suggest that rs3877899 
might be associated with glucose concentrations and rs7579 with cholesterol 
concentrations. Therefore, the effect of genetic variations should be considered 
in future nutritional interventions evaluating the response to Brazil nut 
supplementation.
