In the title compound, [Cd(SO(4))(C(12)H(8)N(2))(2)]·C(3)H(8)O(2), the Cd(II) 
atom has a distorted octa-hedral coordination composed of four N atoms from two 
chelating 1,10-phenanthroline ligands and two O atoms from an O,O'-bidentate 
sulfate group. The two chelating NCCN groups subtend a dihedral angle of 
82.21 (9)°. The Cd(II) ion, the S atom and the middle C atom of the 
propane-1,3-diol solvent mol-ecule are located on special positions, site 
symmetry 2. The solvate features a pair of O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds with the 
uncoordinated O atoms of the sulfate ion. The OH group of the propane-1,3-diol 
solvent is disordered over two positions of equal occupancy.
