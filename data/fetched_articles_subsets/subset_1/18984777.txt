OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to screen adolescents with type 1 
diabetes using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to 1) test the 
hypothesis that using a preset sleep time results in an overdiagnosis of 
abnormal nocturnal dipping in systolic blood pressure and 2) assess the 
reproducibility of an abnormal nocturnal systolic blood pressure dip.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For aim 1, ABPM from 53 adolescent patients with 
type 1 diabetes was reviewed. Nocturnal dips in systolic blood pressure 
calculated by actual sleep time were compared with those from a preset sleep 
time. For aim 2, blood pressure monitoring from 98 patients using actual 
reported sleep time was reviewed. Reproducibility of the nocturnal dip in 
systolic blood pressure was assessed in a subset of "nondippers."
RESULTS: For aim 1, the actual mean +/- SE decline in nocturnal systolic blood 
pressure was 11.6 +/- 4.7%, whereas the mean decline in nocturnal systolic blood 
pressure calculated using the preset sleep time was 8.8 +/- 4.9% (P < 0.0001). 
For aim 2, 64% of patients had a normal nocturnal decline in systolic blood 
pressure (14.9 +/- 3.1% mmHg), whereas 36% had an abnormal dip (5.7 +/- 2.8% 
mmHg). Repeat ABPM performed in 22 of the 35 nondippers revealed that only 36% 
had abnormal systolic dipping confirmed on the repeat ABPM.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of actual reported sleep time is required to accurately 
determine the nocturnal dip in systolic blood pressure. Repeating ABPM in 
nondippers is essential to confirm this abnormality.
