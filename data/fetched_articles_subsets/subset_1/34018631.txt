BACKGROUND: QRFPR is a recently identified member of the G protein-coupled 
receptor and is an orphan receptor for 26Rfa, which plays important role in the 
regulation of many physiological functions.
METHODS: Here, we employed whole exome sequencing (WES) to examine the patients 
with intellectual disability (ID) and difficulty in feeding. We performed SIFT 
and PolyPhen2 predictions for the variants. The structure model was built from 
scratch by I-TASSER. Here, results derived from a number of cell-based 
functional assays, including shRNA experiment, intracellular Ca2+ measurement, 
the expression of PI3 K-AKT-mTOR, and phosphorylation. The functional effect of 
QRFPR variants on PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling was evaluated in vitro transfection 
experiments.
RESULT: Here, we identified two QRFPR variants at c.202 T>C (p.Y68H) and 
c.1111C>T (p.R371W) in 2 unrelated individuals. Structural analysis revealed 
that p.Y68H and p.R371W variants may affect the side chain structure of adjacent 
amino acids causing reduced binding of QRFPR to 26Rfa. The results show that 
QRFPR stimulated by 26Rfa leading to the transient rise of intracellular Ca2+ . 
The QRFPR variations p.Y68H and p.R371 W can reduce the mobilization of 
intracellular Ca2+ . The phosphorylation levels of the PI3K, Akt, and mTOR were 
significantly up- or downregulated by QRFPR overexpression or silencing, 
respectively. The QRFPR variations inhibited PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, resulting 
in downregulation of p-mTOR.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that QRFPR acts as important role in 
neurodevelopment, and the effects of QRFPR are likely to be mediated by the Ca2+ 
-dependent PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways. Importantly, these findings provide a 
foundation for future elucidation of GPCR-mediated signaling and the 
physiological implications.
