There are many processes in which the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ 
or nociceptin) is involved in the brain. The role of nociceptin in learning and 
memory holds promise in modulating these processes in health and disease in the 
human brain. This review summarizes the body of research focused on N/OFQ and 
its specific receptor, the nociceptin receptor (NOP receptor), in learning and 
memory, and its potential mechanisms of action, in which acetylcholine, NMDA 
receptor, and noradrenaline may be critical. Finally, the association between 
NOP receptor and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric disorder 
with altered fear learning, is examined as one of the potential outcomes 
resulting from pathological consequences of dysregulation of N/OFQ-NOP receptor 
in the brain.
