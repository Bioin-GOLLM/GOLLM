OBJECTIVE: Mutation analysis of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) epsilon 
subunit gene in patients with sporadic or autosomal recessive congenital 
myasthenic syndromes (CMS).
BACKGROUND: The nicotinic AChR of skeletal muscle is a neurotransmitter-gated 
ion channel that mediates synaptic transmission at the vertebrate neuromuscular 
junction. Mutations in its gene may cause congenital myasthenic syndromes. A 
recently described mutation in exon 12 of the AChR epsilon subunit 
(epsilon1267delG) disrupts the cytoplasmic loop and the fourth transmembrane 
region (M4) of the AChR epsilon subunit.
METHODS: Forty-three CMS patients from 35 nonrelated families were clinically 
classified as sporadic cases of CMS (group III according to European 
Neuromuscular Centre consensus) and were analyzed for epsilon1267delG by PCR 
amplification and sequence analysis.
RESULTS: The authors report the complete genomic sequence and organization of 
the gene coding for the epsilon subunit of the human AChR (accession number 
AF105999). Homozygous epsilon1267delG was identified in 13 CMS patients from 11 
independent families. All epsilon1267delG families were of Gypsy or southeastern 
European origin. Genotype analysis indicated that they derive from a common 
ancestor (founder) causing CMS in the southeastern European Gypsy population. 
Phenotype analysis revealed a uniform pattern of clinical features including 
bilateral ptosis and mild to moderate fatigable weakness of ocular, facial, 
bulbar, and limb muscles.
CONCLUSIONS: The mutation epsilon1267delG might be frequent in European 
congenital myasthenic syndrome patients of Gypsy ethnic origin. In general, 
patients (epsilon1267delG) were characterized by the onset of symptoms in early 
infancy, the presence of ophthalmoparesis, positive response to 
anticholinesterase treatment, and the benign natural course of the disease.
