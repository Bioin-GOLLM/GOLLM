Cyclophilins are chaperone proteins that play important roles in signal 
transduction. Among them, cyclophilins A, B, C, and D were widely associated 
with inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. Cyclophilins A and C have been 
proposed as coronary artery disease biomarkers. However, less is known about 
their relationship with cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, this study aimed 
to determine the association between cyclophilin A, B, C, and D and 
cardiovascular risk factors in coronary artery disease. Serum levels of 
cyclophilins were measured in 167 subjects (subdivided according to 
cardiovascular risk factors presence). This study reveals that cyclophilin A and 
C are elevated in patients regardless of the risk factors presence. Moreover, 
cyclophilin B is elevated in male patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, 
or high glucose levels. In addition, cyclophilins A, B, and C were significantly 
correlated with cardiovascular risk factors, but only cyclophilin B was 
associated with type 2 diabetes. The multivariate analysis strengthens the 
predictive value for coronary artery disease presence of cyclophilin A 
(>8.2 ng/mL) and cyclophilin C (>17.5 pg/mL) along with the cardiovascular risk 
factors tobacco, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and high glucose and cholesterol 
levels. Moreover, the risk of coronary artery disease is increased in presence 
of cyclophilin B levels above 63.26 pg/mL and with hypertension or dyslipidemia 
in male patients. Consequently, cyclophilins A and C serum levels are reinforced 
as useful coronary artery disease biomarkers, meanwhile, cyclophilin B is a 
valuable biomarker in the male population when patients are also suffering from 
hypertension or dyslipidemia.
