TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4), a calcium permeable TRP ion 
channel, is known to play a key role in endocytosis. However, whether it 
contributes to exocytosis remains unclear. Here, we report that activation of 
TRPV4 induced massive exocytosis in both melanoma A375 cell and heterologous 
expression systems. We show here that, upon application of TRPV4-specific 
agonists, prominent vesicle priming from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was 
observed, followed by morphological changes of mitochondrial crista may lead to 
cell ferroptosis. We further identified interactions between TRPV4 and 
folding/vesicle trafficking proteins, which were triggered by calcium entry 
through activated TRPV4. This interplay, in turn, enhanced TRPV4-mediated 
activation of folding and vesicle trafficking proteins to promote exocytosis. 
Our study revealed a signaling mechanism underlying stimulus-triggered 
exocytosis in melanoma and highlighted the role of cellular sensor TRPV4 ion 
channel in mediating ferroptosis.
