Hepatitis C (HCV) is a major cause of liver disease, in which a third of 
individuals with chronic HCV infections may develop liver cirrhosis. In a 
chronic HCV infection, host immune factors along with the actions of HCV 
proteins that promote viral persistence and dysregulation of the immune system 
have an impact on immunopathogenesis of HCV-induced hepatitis. The genome of HCV 
encodes a single polyprotein, which is translated and processed into structural 
and nonstructural proteins. These HCV proteins are the target of the innate and 
adaptive immune system of the host. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like 
receptors and Toll-like receptors are the main pattern recognition receptors 
that recognize HCV pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This interaction 
results in a downstream cascade that generates antiviral cytokines including 
interferons. The cytolysis of HCV-infected hepatocytes is mediated by perforin 
and granzyme B secreted by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer (NK) 
cells, whereas noncytolytic HCV clearance is mediated by interferon gamma 
(IFN-γ) secreted by CTL and NK cells. A host-HCV interaction determines whether 
the acute phase of an HCV infection will undergo complete resolution or progress 
to the development of viral persistence with a consequential progression to 
chronic HCV infection. Furthermore, these host-HCV interactions could pose a 
challenge to developing an HCV vaccine. This review will focus on the role of 
the innate and adaptive immunity in HCV infection, the failure of the immune 
response to clear an HCV infection, and the factors that promote viral 
persistence.
