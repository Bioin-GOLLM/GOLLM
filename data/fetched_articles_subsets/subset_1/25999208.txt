A series of 17 new analogues of trypsin inhibitor SFTI-1 were designed and 
synthesized to obtain matriptase-2 inhibitors. A number of the modified bicyclic 
peptides displayed much higher affinity towards matriptase-2 than towards the 
highly homologous matriptase-1. Replacement of Lys5 by Arg in the wild-type 
SFTI-1 led to an 11-fold increase in the matriptase-2 inhibitory activity. 
Replacement of Arg2 by its enantiomer (D-arginine) slightly lowered the 
inhibition of matriptase-2, but almost completely abolished the affinity towards 
matriptase-1, thus yielding the most selective matriptase-2 inhibitor. This is 
the first report describing inhibitors of the recently discovered matriptase-2 
based on the SFTI-1 structure. The results showed that SFTI-1 is a promising 
scaffold for the design of potent and selective inhibitors of this enzyme.
