This paper reviews the metabolism of new designer drugs of abuse that have 
emerged on the black market during the last years and is an update of a review 
published in 2005. The presented review contains data concerning the so-called 
2C compounds (phenethylamine type) such as 
4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine (2C-B), 
4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine (2C-I), 
2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-beta-phenethylamine (2C-D), 
4-ethyl-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine (2C-E), 
4-ethylthio-2,5-dimethoxy-beta-phenethylamine (2C-T-2), and 
2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthio-beta-phenethylamine (2C-T-7), beta-keto designer 
drugs such as 2-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)butan-1-one (butylone, 
bk-MBDB), 2-ethylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-one (ethylone, 
bk-MDEA), 2-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylene notdioxy notphenyl)propan-1-one 
(methylone, bk-MDMA), and 2-methylamino-1-p-tolylpropane-1-one (mephedrone, 
4-methyl-methcathinone), pyrrolidino notphenones such as 
4-methyl-pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (MPBP) and alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone 
(PVP), phencyclidine-derived drugs such as N (1 phenylcyclohexyl) propanamine 
(PCPr), N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-2-ethoxyethanamine (PCEEA), 
N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3-methoxypropanamine (PCMPA), and 
N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-2-methoxyethanamine (PCMEA), tryptamines such as 
5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyl nottryptamine (5-MeO-DIPT), and finally 
alpha-methylfentanyl (alpha-MF) and 3-methylfentanyl (3-MF). Papers have been 
considered and reviewed on the identification of in vivo or in vitro human or 
animal metabolites and the cytochrome P450 or monoamineoxidase 
isoenzyme-dependent metabolism.
