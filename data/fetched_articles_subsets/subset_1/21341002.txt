The prothrombin gene has recently been investigated as a candidate gene for 
venous thrombosis risk in selected individuals with a history of venous 
thrombosis (1). A genetic variation in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the 
prothrombin gene, a G to A transition at nucleotide position 20210, was found in 
18% of selected patients with a personal and family history of venous 
thrombosis, in 6.2% of unselected consecutive patients with a first episode of 
deep vein thrombosis, and in 2.3% of healthy control subjects (1).
