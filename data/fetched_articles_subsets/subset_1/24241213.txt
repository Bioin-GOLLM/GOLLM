Effect of dairy proteins on gluten-free dough behavior, and nutritional and 
technological properties of gluten-free bread was evaluated. Experimental 
doughs, containing dairy powders, showed low consistency. Obtained gluten-free 
breads were rich in proteins, and, regarding the energy value delivered by 
proteins, they could be considered as a source of proteins or high in proteins. 
Applied dairy proteins affected the technological properties of experimental 
breads causing a significant (p < 0.05) increase of the specific volume, crust 
darkening, and crumb lightness, depending on the dairy supplementation level, 
rather than the protein type. Dairy proteins incorporated at a 12% level, 
significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the hardness; nevertheless, the highest 
amount of proteins tested led to the opposite effect. These results indicate 
that milk proteins tested could be successfully added to gluten-free bread with 
beneficial effects on technological and nutritional properties.
