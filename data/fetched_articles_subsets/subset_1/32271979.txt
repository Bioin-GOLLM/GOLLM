TET family enzymes are known for oxidation of the 5-methyl substituent on 
5-methylcytosine (5mC) in DNA. 5mC oxidation generates the stable base 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), starting an indirect, multi-step process that 
ends with reversion of 5mC to unmodified cytosine. While probing the nucleobase 
determinants of 5mC recognition, we discovered that TET enzymes are also 
proficient as direct N-demethylases of cytosine bases. We find that 
N-demethylase activity can be readily observed on substrates lacking a 5-methyl 
group and, remarkably, TET enzymes can be similarly proficient in either 
oxidation of 5mC or demethylation of N4-methyl substituents. Our results 
indicate that TET enzymes can act as both direct and indirect demethylases, 
highlight the active-site plasticity of these FeII /α-ketoglutarate-dependent 
dioxygenases, and suggest activity on unexplored substrates that could reveal 
new TET biology.
