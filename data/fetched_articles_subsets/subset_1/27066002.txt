Within tumors, some areas are less oxygenated than others. Since their home 
ground is under chronic hypoxia, tumor cells adapt to this condition by 
activating aerobic glycolysis; however, this hypoxic environment is very harsh 
for incoming immune cells. Deprivation of oxygen limits availability of energy 
sources and induces accumulation of extracellular adenosine in tumors. 
Extracellular adenosine, upon binding with adenosine receptors on the surface of 
various immune cells, suppresses pro-inflammatory activities. In addition, 
signaling through adenosine receptors upregulates a number of anti-inflammatory 
molecules and immunoregulatory cells, leading to the establishment of a 
long-lasting immunosuppressive environment. Thus, due to hypoxia and adenosine, 
tumors can discourage antitumor immune responses no matter how the response was 
induced, whether it was spontaneous or artificially introduced with a 
therapeutic intention. Preclinical studies have shown the significance of 
adenosine in tumor survival strategy by demonstrating tumor regression after 
inactivation of adenosine receptors, inhibition of adenosine-producing enzymes, 
or reversal of tissue hypoxia. These promising results indicate a potential use 
of the inhibitors of the hypoxia-adenosine pathway for cancer immunotherapy.
