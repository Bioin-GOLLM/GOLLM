BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a major lifestyle disease 
endangering human health worldwide. Patients with T2DM face varying degrees of 
loneliness, which adversely affects their family and the larger society. This 
study investigates the serial multiple mediating roles of depression and 
self-perceived burden between family function and loneliness in the T2DM 
population of China.
METHODS: In total, 260 T2DM patients were included. They rated themselves based 
on UCLA Loneliness Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety 
Scale, Family Care Index, and Self-Perceived Burden Scale. Pearson and Spearman 
correlation analyses were conducted to clarify the association among variables. 
The SPSS macro-PROCESS program was used for a series of multiple mediation 
analyses.
RESULTS: Family function, depression, self-perceived burden, and loneliness were 
significantly correlated (P < 0.01). Family function not only has a direct 
negative impact (effect = -2.809; SE = 0.213; 95%CI: LL = -3.228, UL = -2.390) 
on loneliness, but also has an indirect impact on loneliness through the 
independent mediating role of depression (effect = -0.862; SE = 0.165; 95%CI: LL 
= -1.202, UL = -0.567) and self-perceived burden (effect = -0.288; SE = 0.107; 
95%CI: LL = -0.525, UL = -0.114) and the chain mediating role of depression and 
self-perceived burden (effect = -0.202; SE = 0.066; 95%CI: LL = -0.342, UL = 
-0.088).
CONCLUSIONS: Diversified interventions aimed at improving family function of 
T2DM patients would help in reducing the level of depression and self-perceived 
burden, and ultimately reducing loneliness.
