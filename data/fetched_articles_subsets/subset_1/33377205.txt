Discoidin domain receptors (DDR), including DDR1 and DDR2, are special types of 
the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. DDR are activated by 
binding to the triple-helical collagen and, in turn, DDR can activate signal 
transduction pathways that regulate cell-collagen interactions involved in 
multiple physiological and pathological processes such as cell proliferation, 
migration, apoptosis, and cytokine secretion. Recently, DDR have been found to 
contribute to various diseases, including cancer. In addition, aberrant 
expressions of DDR have been reported in various human cancers, which indicates 
that DDR1 and DDR2 could be new targets for cancer treatment. Considerable 
effort has been made to design DDR inhibitors and several molecules have shown 
therapeutic effects in pre-clinical models. In this article, we review the 
recent literature on the role of DDR in cancer progression, the development 
status of DDR inhibitors, and the clinical potential of targeting DDR in cancer 
therapies.
