We observed earlier that there are 5 nucleotide polymorphisms in the protein 
coding sequence of the acid beta-galactosidase gene between the C57BL/6J and 
DBA/2J strains of mice. Two of them result in amino acid substitutions. 
Consequences of the difference in the primary amino acid sequence were studied 
by introducing the two DBA polymorphisms into the C57BL cDNA, individually and 
in combination, by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and expressing the 
resultant cDNAs in the COS-1 cell expression system. Introduction of one 
polymorphism, Asn517-->Asp into the C57BL cDNA, did not alter the acid 
beta-galactosidase activity in the transfected COS-1 cells, while introduction 
of Gly539-->Arg completely abolished the catalytic activity. When both 
polymorphisms were introduced together, as in the DBA mice, however, the acid 
beta-galactosidase activity was restored to that of the C57BL level. Thus, 
Asn517-->Asp appears to counteract the activity-abolishing effect of 
Gly539-->Arg, although it does not by itself raise the catalytic activity. All 
four types of cDNA generated similarly large amounts of stable mRNA in COS-1 
cells. These results do not explain the significantly low acid 
beta-galactosidase activity in tissues of DBA mice, described earlier and also 
confirmed in this study.
