Marinobacter is the abundant and important algal-associated and hydrocarbon 
biodegradation bacteria in the ocean. However, little knowledge about their 
phages has been reported. Here, a novel siphovirus, vB_MalS-PS3, infecting 
Marinobacter algicola DG893(T), was isolated from the surface waters of the 
western Pacific Ocean. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that 
vB_MalS-PS3 has the morphology of siphoviruses. VB_MalS-PS3 was stable from -20 
to 55°C, and with the latent and rise periods of about 80 and 10 min, 
respectively. The genome sequence of VB_MalS-PS3 contains a linear, 
double-strand 42,168-bp DNA molecule with a G + C content of 56.23% and 54 
putative open reading frames (ORFs). Nineteen conserved domains were predicted 
by BLASTp in NCBI. We found that vB_MalS-PS3 represent an understudied viral 
group with only one known isolate. The phylogenetic tree based on the amino acid 
sequences of whole genomes revealed that vB_MalS-PS3 has a distant evolutionary 
relationship with other siphoviruses, and can be grouped into a novel viral 
genus cluster with six uncultured assembled viral genomes from metagenomics, 
named here as Marinovirus. This study of the Marinobacter phage vB_MalS-PS3 
genome enriched the genetic database of marine bacteriophages, in addition, will 
provide useful information for further research on the interaction between 
Marinobacter phages and their hosts, and their relationship with algal blooms 
and hydrocarbon biodegradation in the ocean.
