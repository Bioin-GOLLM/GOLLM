BACKGROUND: Mutations in the gene COL17A1 coding for type XVII collagen cause 
non-Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (nH-JEB).
OBJECTIVES: Here we give an overview of the genotype-phenotype correlation in 12 
patients from the Netherlands with type XVII collagen-deficient nH-JEB.
PATIENT AND METHODS: Family and personal history and clinical presentation were 
recorded from each patient, and skin biopsies of intact and bullous skin were 
taken for immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The mutations were 
identified by analysing the patient's DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells.
RESULTS: DNA analysis identified five novel deletions: 1284delA, 1365delC, 
3236delT, 3600-3601delCT and 4425delT. Interestingly, we identified a new 
patient, homozygous for 4425delT, with an exceptionally mild blistering 
phenotype. All together, three patients had more localized blistering confined 
to hands, lower legs and face, absent or very mild nail dystrophy, normal 
primary hair and sparse secondary hair. Nine patients had generalized 
blistering, nail dystrophy, sparse primary and absent secondary hair. All 12 
patients had amelogenesis imperfecta (enamel pitting). Immunofluorescence (IF) 
antigen mapping with monoclonal antibodies 1A8C and 1D1 that bind to type XVII 
collagen, but not to its 97-kDa fragment was completely negative in patients 
with generalized blistering, whereas reduced in patients with localized 
blistering.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that in patients with COL17A1 mutations a localized 
nH-JEB phenotype can be differentiated from a generalized nH-JEB phenotype by IF 
antigen mapping. The data are important for genetic counselling at early age 
when the clinical phenotype is not yet clear.
