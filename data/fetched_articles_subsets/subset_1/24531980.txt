Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Herein we 
report a case of a 49-year-old woman who developed bilateral knee pain. Imaging 
procedures revealed multiple long bone lesions and a well-defined 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid mass in the left breast. The breast mass was 
resected, and an open biopsy was performed on the right femoral lesion. Both 
specimens revealed involvement by histiocytic infiltrates with features 
suggestive of ECD. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected by DNA sequencing and 
immunohistochemistry.
