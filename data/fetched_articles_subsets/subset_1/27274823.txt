BACKGROUND: Post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is an immune 
complex-mediated glomerular injury that typically resolves. Dominant C3 
deposition is characteristic of PIGN, but with the emergence of C3 
glomerulonephritis (C3GN) as a distinct entity, it is unclear how the pathologic 
similarities between PIGN and C3GN should be reconciled. Therefore, 
nephrologists and nephropathologists need additional guidance at the time of 
biopsy.
METHODS: We studied 23 pediatric and young adult patients diagnosed with PIGN. 
Patients were divided into two groups, one with co-dominance between C3 and 
immunoglobulins and the other meeting proposed diagnostic criteria for C3GN. 
Clinical and pathological features were compared.
RESULTS: No clinical and/or pathological features could distinguish between 
those with C3-co-dominant deposits and those with C3 dominance. Nearly all 
patients in both groups regained their baseline renal function without clinical 
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the identification of abnormalities of the alternative 
pathway of complement is characteristic of C3GN, testing is not widely available 
and the turnaround time often exceeds 1 month. Our study found that PIGN with 
either co-dominant or dominant C3 deposition in a cohort of young patients has 
excellent short-term outcomes. Close clinical observation for persistent 
abnormalities, such as hypocomplementemia, prolonged hematuria or proteinuria, 
is recommended to single out patients that may harbor intrinsic complement 
abnormalities.
