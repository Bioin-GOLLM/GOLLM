High albumin concentrations in the proximal tubule of the kidney causes 
tubulointerstitial injury, but how this process occurs is not completely known. 
To address the signal transduction pathways mis-regulated in renal injury, we 
studied the modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes by 
physiologic and pathophysiologic albumin concentrations in proximal tubule 
cells. Physiologic albumin concentrations activated the 
PI3K/mTORC2/PKB/mTORC1/S6 kinase (S6K) pathway, but pathophysiologically high 
albumin concentrations overactivated mTORC1 and inhibited mTORC2 activity. This 
control process involved the activation of ERK1/2, which promoted the inhibition 
of TSC2 and activation of S6K. Furthermore, S6K was crucial to promoting the 
over activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of mTORC2. Megalin expression at the 
luminal membrane is reduced by high concentrations of albumin. In addition, 
knockdown of megalin mimicked all the effects of pathophysiologic albumin 
concentrations, which disrupt normal signal transduction pathways and lead to an 
overactivation of mTORC1 and inhibition of mTORC2. These data provide new 
perspectives for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind the effects of 
albumin on the progression of renal disease.
