A computational approach for identification and assessment of genomic sequence 
variability (GeneSV) is described. For a given nucleotide sequence, GeneSV 
collects information about the permissible nucleotide variability (changes that 
potentially preserve function) observed in corresponding regions in genomic 
sequences, and combines it with conservation/variability results from protein 
sequence and structure-based analyses of evaluated protein coding regions. 
GeneSV was used to predict effects (functional vs. non-functional) of 37 amino 
acid substitutions on the NS5 polymerase (RdRp) of dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2), 
36 of which are not observed in any publicly available DENV-2 sequence. 32 novel 
mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the RdRp were generated using a 
DENV-2 reverse genetics system. In 81% (26 of 32) of predictions tested, GeneSV 
correctly predicted viability of introduced mutations. In 4 of 5 (80%) mutants 
with double amino acid substitutions proximal in structure to one another GeneSV 
was also correct in its predictions. Predictive capabilities of the developed 
system were illustrated on dengue RNA virus, but described in the manuscript a 
general approach to characterize real or theoretically possible variations in 
genomic and protein sequences can be applied to any organism.
