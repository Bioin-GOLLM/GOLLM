Sec1/Munc18-family (SM) proteins are required for SNARE-mediated membrane 
fusion, but their mechanism(s) of action remain controversial. Using 
single-molecule force spectroscopy, we found that the SM protein Munc18-1 
catalyzes step-wise zippering of three synaptic SNAREs (syntaxin, VAMP2, and 
SNAP-25) into a four-helix bundle. Catalysis requires formation of an 
intermediate template complex in which Munc18-1 juxtaposes the N-terminal 
regions of the SNARE motifs of syntaxin and VAMP2, while keeping their 
C-terminal regions separated. SNAP-25 binds the templated SNAREs to induce full 
SNARE zippering. Munc18-1 mutations modulate the stability of the template 
complex in a manner consistent with their effects on membrane fusion, indicating 
that chaperoned SNARE assembly is essential for exocytosis. Two other SM 
proteins, Munc18-3 and Vps33, similarly chaperone SNARE assembly via a template 
complex, suggesting that SM protein mechanism is conserved.
