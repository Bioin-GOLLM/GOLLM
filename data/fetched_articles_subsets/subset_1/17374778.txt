The interferon-induced human MxA protein belongs to the dynamin superfamily of 
large GTPases and accumulates in the cytoplasm. MxA is a key component of the 
innate antiviral response and has previously been shown to inhibit several 
viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes of both polarities and a DNA virus. In 
addition, MxA also targets two double-stranded RNA viruses, Infectious bursal 
disease virus and a mammalian reovirus as shown in this study. Thus, the 
antiviral spectrum of human MxA is broader than hitherto suspected. 
Interestingly, virus growth was not affected in cells expressing MxA(E645R), a 
mutant form of MxA that showed antiviral activity against orthomyxoviruses.
