BACKGROUND: The association between spondyloarthropathy and Crohn's disease is 
well known. A risk for evolution to Crohn's disease has already been shown in 
the subgroup of patients with spondyloarthropathy associated with chronic gut 
inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the reported polymorphisms in the CARD15 gene, 
a susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease, are associated with the presence of 
preclinical intestinal inflammation observed in spondyloarthropathies.
METHODS: 104 patients with spondyloarthropathies were studied. All underwent 
ileocolonoscopy with biopsies between 1983 and 2004. The prevalence of three 
single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CARD15 gene (R702W, G908R, and 1007fs) 
was assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain 
reaction (RFLP-PCR); the patients were compared with an ethnically matched 
Crohn's disease population and a control population.
RESULTS: The carrier frequency of R702W, G908R, or 1007fs variants in the 
spondyloarthropathy populations (20%) was similar to the control population 
(17%), but increased to 38% in the spondyloarthropathy subgroup with chronic gut 
inflammation. This frequency was significantly higher than in the other 
spondyloarthropathy subgroups (p = 0.001) or the control group (p = 0.006), but 
not different from the Crohn's disease group (49%) (NS). This indicates that 
CARD15 polymorphisms are associated with a higher risk for development of 
chronic gut inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: CARD15 gene polymorphisms clearly identify a subgroup of patients 
with spondyloarthropathies associated with chronic intestinal inflammation.
