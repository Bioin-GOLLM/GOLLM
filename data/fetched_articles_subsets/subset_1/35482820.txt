The nucleoside analog remdesivir (RDV) is a Food and Drug 
Administration-approved antiviral for treatment of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Thus, it is critical to 
understand factors that promote or prevent RDV resistance. We passaged 
SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of GS-441524, the parent 
nucleoside of RDV. After 13 passages, we isolated three viral lineages with 
phenotypic resistance as defined by increases in half-maximal effective 
concentration from 2.7- to 10.4-fold. Sequence analysis identified nonsynonymous 
mutations in nonstructural protein 12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp): 
V166A, N198S, S759A, V792I, and C799F/R. Two lineages encoded the S759A 
substitution at the RdRp Ser759-Asp-Asp active motif. In one lineage, the V792I 
substitution emerged first and then combined with S759A. Introduction of S759A 
and V792I substitutions at homologous nsp12 positions in murine hepatitis virus 
demonstrated transferability across betacoronaviruses; introduction of these 
substitutions resulted in up to 38-fold RDV resistance and a replication defect. 
Biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp encoding S759A demonstrated a roughly 
10-fold decreased preference for RDV-triphosphate (RDV-TP) as a substrate, 
whereas nsp12-V792I diminished the uridine triphosphate concentration needed to 
overcome template-dependent inhibition associated with RDV. The in 
vitro-selected substitutions identified in this study were rare or not detected 
in the greater than 6 million publicly available nsp12-RdRp consensus sequences 
in the absence of RDV selection. The results define genetic and biochemical 
pathways to RDV resistance and emphasize the need for additional studies to 
define the potential for emergence of these or other RDV resistance mutations in 
clinical settings.
