Live viral vectors expressing foreign antigens have shown great promise as 
vaccines against viral diseases. However, safety concerns remain a major problem 
regarding the use of even highly attenuated viral vectors. Using the rabies 
virus (RV) envelope protein as a carrier molecule, we show here that inactivated 
RV particles can be utilized to present Bacillus anthracis protective antigen 
(PA) domain-4 in the viral membrane. In addition to the RV glycoprotein (G) 
transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, a portion of the RV G ectodomain was 
required to express the chimeric RV G anthrax PA on the cell surface. The novel 
antigen was also efficiently incorporated into RV virions. Mice immunized with 
the inactivated recombinant RV virions exhibited seroconversion against both RV 
G and anthrax PA, and a second inoculation greatly increased these responses. 
These data demonstrate that a viral envelope protein can carry a bacterial 
protein and that a viral carrier can display whole polypeptides compared to the 
limited epitope presentation of previous viral systems.
