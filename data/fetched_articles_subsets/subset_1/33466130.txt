BACKGROUND: Polymorphism in miR-27a rs895819 has been associated with breast 
cancer (BC) risk, but studies have reported inconsistent results. This 
meta-analysis investigated the possible association between miR-27a rs895819 
polymorphism and BC risk.
METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and the Chinese National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were systematically searched to identify 
relevant studies in English and Chinese. Meta-analyses were performed to examine 
the association between miR-27a rs895819 and BC susceptibility.
RESULTS: A total of 16 case-control studies involving 6118 cases and 7042 
controls were included. Analysis using five genetic models suggested no 
significant association between miR-27a rs895819 polymorphism and BC risk in the 
total population, or specifically in Asian or Chinese subpopulations. In the 
Caucasian subpopulation, however, the G-allele and AG genotype at rs895819 were 
significantly associated with decreased BC risk according to the allelic model 
(OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.97, P = .004) and heterozygous model (OR 0.89, 95% CI 
0.81-089, P = .02), while the wild-type AA genotype was significantly associated 
with increased BC risk according to the dominant model (OR 1.13, 95% CI 
1.03-1.24, P = .007).
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that among Caucasians, the wild-type AA 
genotype at rs895819 may confer increased susceptibility to BC, while the 
G-allele and AG genotype may be protective factors. These conclusions should be 
verified in large, well-designed studies.
