Fluorinated carbohydrates have found many applications in the glycosciences. 
Typically, these contain fluorination at a single position. There are not many 
applications involving polyfluorinated carbohydrates, here defined as 
monosaccharides in which more than one carbon has at least one fluorine 
substituent directly attached to it, with the notable exception of their use as 
mechanism-based inhibitors. The increasing attention to carbohydrate physical 
properties, especially around lipophilicity, has resulted in a surge of interest 
for this class of compounds. This review covers the considerable body of work 
toward the synthesis of polyfluorinated hexoses, pentoses, ketosugars, and 
aminosugars including sialic acids and nucleosides. An overview of the current 
state of the art of their glycosidation is also provided.
