Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) regulate bidirectional transport between the 
nucleus and the cytoplasm. Intrinsically disordered FG-Nups line the NPC lumen 
and form a selective barrier, where transport of most proteins is inhibited 
whereas specific transporter proteins freely pass. The mechanism underlying 
selective transport through the NPC is still debated. Here, we reconstitute the 
selective behaviour of the NPC bottom-up by introducing a rationally designed 
artificial FG-Nup that mimics natural Nups. Using QCM-D, we measure selective 
binding of the artificial FG-Nup brushes to the transport receptor Kap95 over 
cytosolic proteins such as BSA. Solid-state nanopores with the artificial 
FG-Nups lining their inner walls support fast translocation of Kap95 while 
blocking BSA, thus demonstrating selectivity. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics 
simulations highlight the formation of a selective meshwork with densities 
comparable to native NPCs. Our findings show that simple design rules can 
recapitulate the selective behaviour of native FG-Nups and demonstrate that no 
specific spacer sequence nor a spatial segregation of different FG-motif types 
are needed to create selective NPCs.
