The title coordination polymer, {[Co2(C15H7O7)(OH)(C14H14N4)]·0.25H2O} n , was 
synthesized under hydro-thermal conditions. The asymmetric unit contains two 
Co(2+) ions, one L (3-) anion originating from 
5-(4-carb-oxy-phen-oxy)isophthalic acid (H3 L), one OH(-) ligand, one 
1,4-bis-[(1H-imidazol-l-yl)meth-yl]benzene (bix) ligand and one disordered 
lattice water mol-ecule (occupancy 0.25). The two Co(2+) ions have different 
environments. One has an octa-hedral O4N2 coordin-ation sphere, defined by four 
O atoms from three carboxyl-ate groups and one OH(-) ligand, and two N atoms 
from two symmetry-related bix ligands. The other has a trigonal-bipyramidal O5 
coordination sphere resulting from three carboxyl-ate groups and two OH(-) 
ligands. The dihedral angles between the two benzene rings in the L (3-) ligand 
and between the benzene ring and the two imidazole rings in the bix ligand are 
67.05 (15), 75.27 (17) and 82.05 (17)°, respectively. Four neighbouring Co(2+) 
ions are linked by six carboxyl-ate groups and two μ 3-OH ligands, forming a 
butterfly-shaped secondary building unit (SBU). These SBUs are connected by L 
(3-) anions into layers parallel to (1-10). Adjacent layers are cross-linked by 
the bix ligands, forming a three-dimensional framework that has a bimodal 
(3,8)-connected tfz-d topology. The disordered lattice water mol-ecule is 
located in the voids of the framework and has O⋯O and O⋯N contacts of 2.81 (2) 
and 2.95 (2) Å, suggesting medium-strength hydrogen bonds. The title compound 
may be a good candidate for artificial eye lenses.
