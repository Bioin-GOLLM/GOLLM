Sulfonylureas are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Despite 
awareness of their effects on cardiac physiology, a knowledge gap exists 
regarding their effects on cardiovascular events in real-world populations. 
Prior studies reported sulfonylurea-associated cardiovascular death but not 
serious arrhythmogenic endpoints like sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or ventricular 
arrhythmia (VA). We assessed the comparative real-world risk of SCA/VA among 
users of second-generation sulfonylureas: glimepiride, glyburide, and glipizide. 
We conducted two incident user cohort studies using five-state Medicaid claims 
(1999-2012) and Optum Clinformatics commercial claims (2000-2016). Outcomes were 
SCA/VA events precipitating hospital presentation. We used Cox proportional 
hazards models, adjusted for high-dimensional propensity scores, to generate 
adjusted hazard ratios (aHR). We identified 624,406 and 491,940 sulfonylurea 
users, and 714 and 385 SCA/VA events, in Medicaid and Optum, respectively. 
Dataset-specific associations with SCA/VA for both glimepiride and glyburide 
(vs. glipizide) were on opposite sides of and could not exclude the null 
(glimepiride: aHRMedicaid 1.17, 95% CI 0.96-1.42; aHROptum 0.84, 0.65-1.08; 
glyburide: aHRMedicaid 0.87, 0.74-1.03; aHROptum 1.11, 0.86-1.42). Database 
differences in data availability, populations, and documentation completeness 
may have contributed to the incongruous results. Emphasis should be placed on 
assessing potential causes of discrepancies between conflicting studies 
evaluating the same research question.
