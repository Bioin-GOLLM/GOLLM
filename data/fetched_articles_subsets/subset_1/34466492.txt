BACKGROUND: THAP11 is a recently discovered pluripotency factor and described as 
an important gene that involved in embryonic stem cells self-renewal and embryo 
development, which works independently with other known pluripotency factors. We 
aimed to overexpressed the THAP11 gene in primary fibroblast cells to determine 
the effects of the THAP11 on these cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The THAP11 gene was amplified using PCR followed by 
ligation into pCDH vector and lentiviral particle production in HEK293T cells by 
using psPAX2 and pMD2.G helper vectors. The human fibroblast cells were 
transduced using viral particles and after confirmation overexpression, the key 
pluripotency factors were estimated using real-time PCR and changes in 
proliferation rate was measured by the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5 
diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test.
RESULTS: The overexpression of THAP11 in fibroblast cells leads to increase the 
expression level of Sox2, Oct4, Nanog and Klf4 as key pluripotency genes and a 
decrease in proliferation rate according to MTT results.
CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that we are faced with a molecule with double 
features, which could be involved in pluripotency and proliferation suppressor 
simultaneously. It seems that the roles of THAP11 in pluripotency are so complex 
and attributed to other regulatory molecules.
