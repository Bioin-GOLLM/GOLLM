Cyanobacteria have attracted much attention as hosts to recycle CO2 into 
valuable chemicals. Although cyanobacteria have been engineered to produce 
various compounds, production efficiencies are too low for commercialization. 
Here we engineer the carbon metabolism of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to 
improve glucose utilization, enhance CO2 fixation and increase chemical 
production. We introduce modifications in glycolytic pathways and the Calvin 
Benson cycle to increase carbon flux and redirect it towards carbon fixation. 
The engineered strain efficiently uses both CO2 and glucose, and produces 
12.6 g l-1 of 2,3-butanediol with a rate of 1.1 g l-1 d-1 under continuous light 
conditions. Removal of native regulation enables carbon fixation and 
2,3-butanediol production in the absence of light. This represents a significant 
step towards industrial viability and an excellent example of carbon metabolism 
plasticity.
