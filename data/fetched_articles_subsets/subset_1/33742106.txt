ATM and ATR are conserved regulators of the DNA damage response linked to 
cancer. Comprehensive DNA sequencing efforts identified ~4,000 cancer-associated 
mutations in ATM/ATR; however, their cancer implications remain largely unknown. 
To gain insights, we identify functionally important conserved residues in ATM, 
ATR and budding yeast Mec1ATR via cancer genome datamining and a functional 
genetic analysis, respectively. Surprisingly, only a small fraction of the 
critical residues is in the active site of the respective enzyme complexes, 
implying that loss of the intrinsic kinase activity is infrequent in 
carcinogenesis. A number of residues are solvent accessible, suggestive of their 
involvement in interacting with a protein-partner(s). The majority, buried 
inside the respective enzyme complexes, might play a structural or regulatory 
role. Together, these findings identify evolutionarily conserved ATM, ATR, and 
Mec1ATR residues involved in diverse aspects of the enzyme function and provide 
fresh insights into the elusive genotype-phenotype relationships in ATM/ATR and 
their cancer-associated variants.
