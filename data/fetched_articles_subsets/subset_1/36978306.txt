The dramatic increase in infections caused by critically multidrug-resistant 
bacteria is a global health concern. In this study, we characterized the 
antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) of K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, E. cloacae 
and A. baumannii isolated from both surgical wound and rectal swab of a single 
Italian patient. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS and the 
antimicrobial susceptibility was carried out by Vitek 2 system. The 
characterization of ARGs was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
methodology (MiSeq Illumina apparatus). K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and E. 
cloacae were resistant to most β-lactams and β-lactam/β-lactamases inhibitor 
combinations. A. baumannii strain was susceptible only to colistin. The presence 
of plasmids (IncN, IncR, IncFIB, ColRNAI and Col (MGD2)) was detected in all 
Enterobacterales but not in A. baumannii strain. The IncN plasmid and blaNDM-1 
gene were found in K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and E. cloacae, suggesting a 
possible transfer of this gene among the three clinical species. Conjugation 
experiments were performed using K. pneumoniae (1 isolate), P. mirabilis (2 
isolates) and E. cloacae (2 isolates) as donors and E. coli J53 as a recipient. 
The blaNDM-1 gene was identified by PCR analysis in all transconjugants 
obtained. The presence of four different bacterial species harboring resistance 
genes to different classes of antibiotics in a single patient substantially 
reduced the therapeutic options.
