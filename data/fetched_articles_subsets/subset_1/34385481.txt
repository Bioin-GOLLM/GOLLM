The Early Cretaceous Hami Pterosaur Fauna in Northwest China preserves a large 
number of specimens of the sexually dimorphic pteranodontoid pterosaur 
Hamipterus tianshanensis, including 3D eggs and embryos. During the last decade, 
several more fossils have been collected in this area, including three 
somphospondylan sauropod specimens. The first is Silutitan sinensis gen. et sp. 
nov., which consists of an articulated middle to posterior cervical vertebrae 
series. The second, Hamititan xinjiangensis gen. et sp. nov., consists of an 
incomplete articulated caudal sequence that could be assigned to lithostrotian 
titanosaurs based on the strongly procoelous caudal vertebrae with lateral 
concave surface, as well as marked ventrolateral ridges. The third specimen 
consists of four sacral vertebral elements, apparently unfused, with exposed 
camellate internal bone and regarded as somphospondylan. Cladistic analyses 
based on different datasets recovered Silutitan sinensis as an euhelopodid 
closely related to Euhelopus and Hamititan xinjiangensis as a titanosaur. 
Besides the pterosaur Hamipterus and one theropod tooth, these dinosaurs are the 
first vertebrates reported in this region, increasing the diversity of the fauna 
as well as the information on Chinese sauropods, further supporting a widespread 
diversification of somphospondylans during the Early Cretaceous of Asia.
