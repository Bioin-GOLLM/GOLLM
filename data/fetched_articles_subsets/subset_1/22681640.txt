BACKGROUND: A growing number of clinical and basic research studies have 
implicated immunological abnormalities as being associated with and potentially 
responsible for the cognitive and behavioral deficits seen in autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) children. Here we test the hypothesis that immune-related gene 
loci are associated with ASD.
FINDINGS: We identified 2,012 genes of known immune-function via Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis. Family-based tests of association were computed on the 22,904 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 2,012 immune-related genes on 
1,510 trios available at the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) repository. 
Several SNPs in immune-related genes remained statistically significantly 
associated with ASD after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Specifically, we 
observed significant associations in the CD99 molecule-like 2 region (CD99L2, 
rs11796490, P = 4.01 × 10-06, OR = 0.68 (0.58-0.80)), in the jumonji AT rich 
interactive domain 2 (JARID2) gene (rs13193457, P = 2.71 × 10-06, OR = 0.61 
(0.49-0.75)), and in the thyroid peroxidase gene (TPO) (rs1514687, 
P = 5.72 × 10-06, OR = 1.46 (1.24-1.72)).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that despite the lack of a general enrichment 
of SNPs in immune function genes in ASD children, several novel genes with known 
immune functions are associated with ASD.
