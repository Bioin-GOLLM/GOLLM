An important consequence of infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant is protective 
humoral immunity against other variants. However, the basis for such 
cross-protection at the molecular level is incompletely understood. Here, we 
characterized the repertoire and epitope specificity of antibodies elicited by 
infection with the Beta, Gamma and WA1 ancestral variants and assessed their 
cross-reactivity to these and the more recent Delta and Omicron variants. We 
developed a method to obtain immunoglobulin sequences with concurrent rapid 
production and functional assessment of monoclonal antibodies from hundreds of 
single B cells sorted by flow cytometry. Infection with any variant elicited 
similar cross-binding antibody responses exhibiting a conserved hierarchy of 
epitope immunodominance. Furthermore, convergent V gene usage and similar public 
B cell clones were elicited regardless of infecting variant. These convergent 
responses despite antigenic variation may account for the continued efficacy of 
vaccines based on a single ancestral variant.
