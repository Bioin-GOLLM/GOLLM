Podosomes are compartmentalized actin-rich adhesions, defined by their ability 
to locally secrete proteases and remodel extracellular matrix. Matrix remodeling 
by endothelial podosomes facilitates invasion and thereby vessel formation. 
However, the mechanisms underlying endothelial podosome formation and function 
remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Septin2, Septin6, and Septin7 are 
required for maturation of nascent endothelial podosomes into matrix-degrading 
organelles. We show that podosome development occurs through initial 
mobilization of the scaffolding protein Tks5 and F-actin accumulation, followed 
by later recruitment of Septin2. Septin2 localizes around the perimeter of 
podosomes in close proximity to the basolateral plasma membrane, and 
phosphoinositide-binding residues of Septin2 are required for podosome function. 
Combined, our results suggest that the septin cytoskeleton forms a diffusive 
barrier around nascent podosomes to promote their maturation. Finally, we show 
that Septin2-mediated regulation of podosomes is critical for endothelial cell 
invasion associated with angiogenesis. Therefore, targeting of Septin2-mediated 
podosome formation is a potentially attractive anti-angiogenesis strategy.
