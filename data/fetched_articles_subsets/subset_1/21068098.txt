BACKGROUND: Evidence is beginning to emerge that there may be susceptibility 
loci for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that 
are common to both diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms that have been 
reported to be associated with SLE in a UK cohort of patients with RA and 
controls.
METHODS: 3962 patients with RA and 9275 controls were included in the study. 
Eleven SNPs mapping to confirmed SLE loci were investigated. These mapped to the 
TNFSF4, BANK1, TNIP1, PTTG1, UHRF1BP1, ATG5, JAZF1, BLK, KIAA1542, ITGAM and 
UBE2L3 loci. Genotype frequencies were compared between patients with RA and 
controls using the trend test.
RESULTS: The SNPs mapping to the BLK and UBE2L3 loci showed significant evidence 
for association with RA. Two other SNPs, mapping to ATG5 and KIAA1542, showed 
nominal evidence for association with RA (p=0.02 and p=0.02, respectively) but 
these were not significant after applying a Bonferroni correction. Additionally, 
a significant global enrichment in carriage of SLE alleles in patients with RA 
compared with controls (p=9.1×10(-7)) was found. Meta-analysis of this and 
previous studies confirmed the association of the BLK and UBE2L3 gene with RA at 
genome-wide significance levels (p<5×10(-8)). Together, the authors estimate 
that the SLE and RA overlapping loci, excluding HLA-DRB1 alleles, identified so 
far explain ∼5.8% of the genetic susceptibility to RA as a whole.
CONCLUSION: The findings confirm the association of the BLK and UBE2L3 loci with 
RA, thus adding to the list of loci showing overlap between RA and SLE.
