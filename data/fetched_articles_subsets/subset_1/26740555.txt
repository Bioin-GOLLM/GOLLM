Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Genome-wide association studies 
based largely on common alleles have identified over 100 schizophrenia risk 
loci, but it is also evident from studies of copy number variants (CNVs) and 
from exome-sequencing studies that rare alleles are also involved. Full 
characterization of the contribution of rare alleles to the disorder awaits the 
deployment of sequencing technology in very large sample sizes, meanwhile, as an 
interim measure, exome arrays allow rare non-synonymous variants to be sampled 
at a fraction of the cost. In an analysis of exome array data from 13 688 
individuals (5585 cases and 8103 controls) from the UK, we found that rare 
(minor allele frequency < 0.1%) variant association signal was enriched among 
genes that map to autosomal loci that are genome-wide significant (GWS) in 
common variant studies of schizophrenia genome-wide association study (PGWAS = 
0.01) as well as gene sets known to be enriched for rare variants in sequencing 
studies (PRARE = 0.026). We also identified the gene-wise equivalent of GWS 
support for WDR88 (WD repeat-containing protein 88), a gene of unknown function 
(P = 6.5 × 10(-7)). Rare alleles represented on exome chip arrays contribute to 
the genetic architecture of schizophrenia, but as is the case for GWAS, very 
large studies are required to reveal additional susceptibility alleles for the 
disorder.
