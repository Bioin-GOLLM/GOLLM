BACKGROUND: Ribavirin (RBV) is an essential component of most current hepatitis 
C (HCV) treatment regimens and still standard of care in the combination with 
pegylated interferon (pegIFN) to treat chronic HCV in resource limited settings. 
Study results in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are contradicting as to whether RBV 
concentration correlates with sustained virological response (SVR).
METHODS: We included 262 HCV treatment naïve HIV/HCV-coinfected Swiss HIV Cohort 
Study (SHCS) participants treated with RBV and pegIFN between 
01.01.2001-01.01.2010, 134 with HCV genotype (GT) 1/4, and 128 with GT 2/3 
infections. RBV levels were measured retrospectively in stored plasma samples 
obtained between HCV treatment week 4 and end of therapy. Uni- and multivariable 
logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between RBV 
concentration and SVR in GT 1/4 and GT 2/3 infections. The analyses were 
repeated stratified by treatment phase (week 4-12, 13-24, >24) and IL28B 
genotype (CC versus CT/TT).
RESULTS: SVR rates were 35.1% in GT 1/4 and 70.3% in GT 2/3 infections. Overall, 
median RBV concentration was 2.0 mg/L in GT 1/4, and 1.9 mg/L in GT 2/3, and did 
not change significantly across treatment phases. Patients with SVR had similar 
RBV concentrations compared to patients without SVR in both HCV genotype groups. 
SVR was not associated with RBV levels ≥2.0 mg/L (GT 1/4, OR 1.19 [0.5-2.86]; GT 
2/3, 1.94 [0.78-4.80]) and ≥2.5 mg/L (GT 1/4, 1.56 [0.64-3.84]; GT 2/3 2.72 
[0.85-8.73]), regardless of treatment phase, and IL28B genotype.
CONCLUSION: In HIV/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegIFN/RBV, therapeutic 
drug monitoring of RBV concentrations does not enhance the chance of HCV cure, 
regardless of HCV genotype, treatment phase and IL28B genotype.

the framework of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, supported by the Swiss National 
Science Foundation (grant # 148522), by SHCS project #650, and by an 
unrestricted grant from Roche Pharma AG. Roche Pharma AG had no influence on the 
study design, or the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. They 
were not involved in writing the manuscript or in the submission process. Roche
