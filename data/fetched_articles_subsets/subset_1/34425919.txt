Increasing evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously 
reported that the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface, formed by the 
choroid plexus epithelial (CPE) cells, releases an increased amount of EVs into 
the CSF in response to peripheral inflammation. Here, we studied the importance 
of CP-mediated EV release in AD pathogenesis. We observed increased EV levels in 
the CSF of young transgenic APP/PS1 mice which correlated with high amyloid beta 
(Aβ) CSF levels at this age. The intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of Aβ 
oligomers (AβO) in wild-type mice revealed a significant increase of EVs in the 
CSF, signifying that the presence of CSF-AβO is sufficient to induce increased 
EV secretion. Using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo approaches, we identified the 
CP as a major source of the CSF-EVs. Interestingly, AβO-induced, CP-derived EVs 
induced pro-inflammatory effects in mixed cortical cultures. Proteome analysis 
of these EVs revealed the presence of several pro-inflammatory proteins, 
including the complement protein C3. Strikingly, inhibition of EV production 
using GW4869 resulted in protection against acute AβO-induced cognitive decline. 
Further research into the underlying mechanisms of this EV secretion might open 
up novel therapeutic strategies to impact the pathogenesis and progression of 
AD.
