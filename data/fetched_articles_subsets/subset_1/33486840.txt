OBJECTIVES: Autosomal-dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta (ADHCAI) 
shows phenotypic heterogeneity. Our aim was to characterise the ADHCAI 
phenotypes, tooth properties and genotypes.
METHODS: Three unrelated ADHCAI probands and seven additional affected members 
of the three families were recruited. Mutations were identified by exome and 
Sanger sequencing, and haplotypes by SNP array. Tooth colour, roughness, 
density, nanohardness, minerals and ultrastructure were investigated.
RESULTS: Ten participants were heterozygous for the FAM83H mutation c.1387C>T 
(p.Gln463*). All shared a 3.43 Mbp region on chromosome 8q24.3 encompassing the 
FAM83H variant, indicating a common ancestry. The c.1387C>T was estimated to be 
23.8 generations or 600 years. The FAM83H enamel had higher roughness and lower 
lightness, density, nanohardness, and calcium and phosphorus levels than 
controls. Blunted enamel rods, wide interrod spaces and disorganised 
dentinoenamel junctions were observed. Evaluating the patients with the same 
mutation and reviewing others with different mutations in FAM83H revealed that 
the FAM83H heterogeneous phenotypes are age-influenced. Tooth colour and surface 
texture change with ageing.
CONCLUSIONS: FAM83H enamel demonstrated decreased lightness, density, hardness, 
calcium, phosphorus and defective ultrastructure. We have identified that the 
phenotypic variation in FAM83H-associated ADHCAI is age-related. Awareness of 
the correlation between age and clinical features of FAM83H-ADHCAI can help 
dentists make an accurate diagnosis.
