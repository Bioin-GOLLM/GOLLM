The role of microtubules (MTs) in steroid hormone-dependent human glucocorticoid 
receptor (hGR) activation/translocation is controversial. It was demonstrated 
recently that colchicine (COL) down-regulates hGR-driven genes in primary human 
hepatocytes by a mechanism involving inhibition of hGR translocation to the 
nucleus. To investigate whether inhibition of hGR translocation is the sole 
reason for its inactivation, we used human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) as a 
model. Herein we present evidence that perturbation of microtubules in HeLa 
cells leads to rapid time- and dose-dependent degradation of hGR protein. 
Degradation is proteasome mediated as revealed by its reversibility by 
proteasome inhibitor MG132. Moreover, degradation was observed for neither 
wt-hGR nor hGR mutants S226A and K419A in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. 
On the other hand, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) seems not to be involved in the 
process because JNK inhibitor 1,9-Pyrazoloanthrone (SP600125) does not reverse 
hGR degradation. Similarly, another hGR functional antagonist, nuclear factor 
kappa beta (NFkappaB), did not play any role in the degradation process.
