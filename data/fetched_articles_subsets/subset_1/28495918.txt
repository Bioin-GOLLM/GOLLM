Bone marrow morphology is a strong discriminator between chronic eosinophilic 
leukemia, not otherwise specified and reactive idiopathic hypereosinophilic 
syndrome.

Chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified can be difficult to 
distinguish from idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome according to the current 
World Health Organization guideline. To examine whether the morphological 
features of bone marrow might aid in the differential diagnosis of these two 
entities, we studied a total of 139 patients with a diagnosis of chronic 
eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (n=17) or idiopathic 
hypereosinophilic syndrome (n=122). As a group, abnormal bone marrow 
morphological features, resembling myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative 
neoplasm or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, were identified in 
40/139 (27%) patients: 16 (94%) of those with chronic eosinophilic leukemia and 
24 (20%) of those with hypereosinophilic syndrome. Abnormal bone marrow 
correlated with older age (P<0.001), constitutional symptoms (P<0.001), anemia 
(P=0.041), abnormal platelet count (P=0.002), organomegaly (P=0.008), elevated 
lactate dehydrogenase concentration (P=0.005), abnormal karyotype (P<0.001), as 
well as the presence of myeloid neoplasm-related mutations (P<0.001). Patients 
with abnormal bone marrow had shorter survival (48.1 months versus not reached, 
P<0.001), a finding which was independent of other confounding factors 
(P<0.001). The association between abnormal bone marrow and shorter survival was 
also observed in hypereosinophilic syndrome patients alone. In summary, most 
patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified and a 
proportion of those with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome show abnormal 
bone marrow features similar to the ones encountered in patients with 
myelodysplastic syndromes, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm or 
BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm. Among patients who are currently 
considered to have idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, abnormal bone marrow 
is a strong indicator of clonal hematopoiesis. Similar to other myeloid 
neoplasms, bone marrow morphology should be one of the major criteria to 
distinguish patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified 
or clonal hypereosinophilic syndrome from those with truly reactive idiopathic 
hypereosinophilic syndrome.
