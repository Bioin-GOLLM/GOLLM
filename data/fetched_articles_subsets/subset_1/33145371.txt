Limitations to successful gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) can 
comprise pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to the vector capsid that can 
block cellular entry, or inefficient transduction of target cells that can lead 
to sub-optimal expression of the therapeutic transgene. Recombinant serotype 3 
AAV (AAV3) is an emerging candidate for liver-directed gene therapy. In this 
study, we integrated rational design by using a combinatorial library derived 
from AAV3B capsids with directed evolution by in vitro selection for 
liver-targeted AAV variants. The AAV3B-DE5 variant described herein was 
undetectable in the original viral library but gained a selective advantage upon 
in vitro passaging in human hepatocarcinoma spheroid cultures. AAV3B-DE5 
contains 24 capsid amino acid substitutions compared with AAV3B, distributed 
among all five variable regions, with strong selective pressure on VR-IV, VR-V, 
and VR-VII. In vivo, AAV3B-DE5 demonstrated improved human hepatocyte tropism in 
a liver chimeric mouse model. Importantly, this variant exhibited reduced 
seroreactivity to human intravenous immunoglobulin (i.v. Ig), as well as 
individual serum samples from 100 healthy human donors. Therefore, molecular 
evolution using a combinatorial library platform generated a viral capsid with 
high hepatocyte tropism and enhanced evasion of pre-existing AAV neutralizing 
antibodies.
