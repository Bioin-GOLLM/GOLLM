The aspartate and tyrosine aminotransferases from Escherichia coli have 43% 
sequence identity and nearly identical active sites. Both are equally good 
enzymes for dicarboxylate substrates, but the latter transaminates aromatic 
amino acids 1000 times faster. In an attempt to discover the critical residues 
for this differential substrate specificity, the aspartate aminotransferase 
mutant V39L has recently been prepared. It showed improved Kcat/Km values for 
aspartate, glutamate and tyrosine and the corresponding oxo acids, mainly due to 
two to ten times lower Km values. For example, the Km values of V39L (wild type) 
for Asp and Glu are 0.12 (1.0) and 0.85 (2.7) mM respectively. The mutant was 
co-crystallized with 30 mM maleate from both polyethylene glycol and ammonium 
sulfate. Both structures were solved and refined to R-factors of 0.22 and 0.20 
at 2.85 and 2.5 A resolution respectively. They bear strong resemblance to the 
closed structure of the wild type enzyme complexed with maleate. The unexpected 
feature is that, for the first time, the closed form was produced in crystals 
grown from ammonium sulfate. It is concluded that the mutation has shifted the 
conformational equilibrium towards the closed form, which leads to generally 
reduced substrate Kms.
