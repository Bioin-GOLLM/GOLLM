Newborns commonly develop physiological hyperbilirubinemia (also known as 
jaundice). With increased bilirubin levels being observed in breast-fed infants, 
breast-feeding has been recognized as a contributing factor for the development 
of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin undergoes selective metabolism by 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and becomes a water soluble glucuronide. 
Although several factors such as gestational age, dehydration and weight loss, 
and increased enterohepatic circulation have been associated with breast 
milk-induced jaundice (BMJ), deficiency in UGT1A1 expression is a known cause of 
BMJ. It is currently believed that unconjugated bilirubin is metabolized mainly 
in the liver. However, recent findings support the concept that extrahepatic 
tissues, such as small intestine and skin, contribute to bilirubin 
glucuronidation during the neonatal period. We will review the recent advances 
made towards understanding biological and molecular events impacting BMJ, 
especially regarding the role of extrahepatic UGT1A1 expression.
