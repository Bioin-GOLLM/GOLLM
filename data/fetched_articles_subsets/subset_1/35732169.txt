INTRODUCTION: The variants of the gene for nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor 
protein (NOS1AP) are associated with schizophrenia and cardiovascular deficits 
involving corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation. Here, we investigated a 
possible pharmacogenetic effect of antipsychotic treatment on QTc length in 
interaction with two NOS1AP variants (rs12143842 and rs10494366) whose minor 
alleles are associated with increased QTc interval length.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electrocardiographic (ECG) and 
genotype data of 239 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. We converted 
antipsychotics dosage to chlorpromazine equivalents and defined daily doses. We 
analysed the effects of the minor (i. e. rs12143842-CT/TT and rs10494366-GT/GG) 
and major (i. e. rs12143842-CC and rs10494366-TT) allele genotypes to QTc 
interval for female and male participants separately.
RESULTS: As expected, rs12143842 and rs10494366 exhibit strong linkage 
disequilibrium. Both polymorphisms had no direct effect on antipsychotic use or 
QTc interval. However, there was a continuous increase in QTc interval with 
increasing antipsychotic dosage in males. For both variants, positive 
correlation of QTc length with antipsychotic dosage was found in homozygous male 
carriers of the major alleles (i. e. rs12143842-CC and rs10494366-TT), but not 
in minor allele carriers. There was no significant interaction between 
antipsychotic dosage and QTc interval for either genotype in female patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a significant interaction was found between both 
NOS1AP variants, rs12143842 and rs10494366, and antipsychotic treatment on the 
QTc interval in a sex-dependent manner. Our findings might be relevant for 
adequate antipsychotic treatment in rs12143842 and rs10494366 major allele 
carriers.
