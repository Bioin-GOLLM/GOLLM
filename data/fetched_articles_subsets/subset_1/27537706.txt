PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to assess exome data for preemptive 
pharmacogenetic screening for 203 clinically relevant pharmacogenetic variant 
positions from the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase and Clinical Pharmacogenetics 
Implementation Consortium and identify copy-number variants (CNVs) in CYP2D6.
METHODS: We examined the coverage and genotype quality of 203 pharmacogenetic 
variant positions in 973 exomes compared with five genomes and with five 
genotyping chip data sets. Then, we determined the agreement of exome and chip 
genotypes by evaluating concordance in a three-way comparison of exome, genome, 
and chip-based genotyping at 1,929 variant positions in five individuals. 
Finally, we evaluated the utility of exomes for detecting CYP2D6 CNVs.
RESULTS: For 5 individuals examined for 203 pharmacogenetic variants (5 × 203 = 
1,015), 998/1,015 were identified by genome, 849/1,015 were identified by exome, 
and 295/1,015 by genotyping chip. Thirty-six pharmacogenetic star allele 
variants with moderate to strong Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation 
Consortium (CPIC) therapeutic recommendations were identified in 973 exomes. 
Exomes had high (98%) genotype concordance with chip-based genotyping. CYP2D6 
CNVs were identified in 57/973 exomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Exomes outperformed the current chip-based assay in detecting more 
important pharmacogenetic variant positions and CYP2D6 CNVs for preemptive 
pharmacogenetic screening. Tools should be developed to derive pharmacogenetic 
variants from exomes.Genet Med 19 3, 357-361.
