PURPOSE: In a large cohort of 373 pediatric patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) 
with a severe cardiovascular phenotype, we explored the proportion of patients 
with MFS with a pathogenic FBN1 variant and analyzed whether the type/location 
of FBN1 variants was associated with specific clinical characteristics and 
response to treatment. Patients were recruited on the basis of the following 
criteria: aortic root z-score > 3, age 6 months to 25 years, no prior or planned 
surgery, and aortic root diameter < 5 cm.
METHODS: Targeted resequencing and deletion/duplication testing of FBN1 and 
related genes were performed.
RESULTS: We identified (likely) pathogenic FBN1 variants in 91% of patients. 
Ectopia lentis was more frequent in patients with dominant-negative (DN) 
variants (61%) than in those with haploinsufficient variants (27%). For DN FBN1 
variants, the prevalence of ectopia lentis was highest in the N-terminal region 
(84%) and lowest in the C-terminal region (17%). The association with a more 
severe cardiovascular phenotype was not restricted to DN variants in the 
neonatal FBN1 region (exon 25-33) but was also seen in the variants in exons 26 
to 49. No difference in the therapeutic response was detected between genotypes.
CONCLUSION: Important novel genotype-phenotype associations involving both 
cardiovascular and extra-cardiovascular manifestations were identified, and 
existing ones were confirmed. These findings have implications for prognostic 
counseling of families with MFS.
