BACKGROUND: Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is one of the most severe type in 
male infertility, and the genetic causes of NOA with meiotic arrest remain 
elusive.
METHODS: Four Chinese families with NOA participated in the study. We performed 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the four NOA-affected patients in four 
pedigrees. The candidate causative gene was further verified by Sanger 
sequencing. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
were carried out to evaluate the stage of spermatogenesis arrested in the 
patients with NOA.
RESULTS: We identified two novel homozygous frameshift mutations of MSH4 and two 
novel compound heterozygous variants in MSH4 in four pedigrees with NOA. 
Homozygous loss of function (LoF) variants in MSH4 was identified in the 
NOA-affected patient (P9359) in a consanguineous Chinese family (NM_002440.4: 
c.805_812del: p.V269Qfs*15) and one patient with NOA (P21504) in another Chinese 
family (NM_002440.4: c.2220_2223del:p.K741Rfs*2). Also, compound heterozygous 
variants in MSH4 were identified in two NOA-affected siblings (P9517 and P9517B) 
(NM_002440.4: c.G1950A: p.W650X and c.2179delG: p.D727Mfs*11), and the patient 
with NOA (P9540) (NM_002440.4: c.G244A: p.G82S and c.670delT: p.L224Cfs*3). 
Histological analysis demonstrated lack of spermatozoa in seminiferous tubules 
of all patients and IHC showed the spermatogenesis arrested at the meiotic 
prophase I stage. Consistent with the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, 
all of these mutations were inherited from heterozygous parental carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified that six novel mutations in MSH4 responsible for 
meiotic arrest and NOA. And these results provide researchers with a new insight 
to understand the genetic etiology of NOA and to identify new loci for genetic 
counselling of NOA.
