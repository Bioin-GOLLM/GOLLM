OBJECTIVE: A C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 
1858 of human protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 complementary DNA carries the 
highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among all non-HLA genetic variants. 
This C1858T SNP converts an arginine (R620) to a tryptophan (W620), but it is 
unclear why it has such a strong impact on RA, a disease characterized by 
anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. The aim of this study was to test the 
hypothesis that PTPN22 regulates protein citrullination.
METHODS: The level of citrullinated proteins in immune cells was quantified by 
Western blotting. The physical interaction between PTPN22 and peptidyl arginine 
deiminase type 4 (PAD-4), which is one of the enzymes that catalyzes protein 
citrullination, was examined by coimmunoprecipitation. Neutrophils were 
collected from healthy donors carrying the C1858T SNP and healthy donors not 
carrying this SNP. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was 
examined by immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: PTPN22 physically interacted with PAD-4, and a deficiency in PTPN22 
enhanced protein citrullination. This abnormality was reversed by exogenous 
wild-type PTPN22 or catalytically dead mutant PTPN22. The R-to-W conversion 
rendered PTPN22 unable to interact with PAD-4 and suppress citrullination. The 
C1858T SNP was associated with hypercitrullination in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and a heightened propensity for spontaneous formation of NETs, 
which is a PAD-4-dependent process.
CONCLUSION: PTPN22 is an inhibitor of PAD-4 and protein citrullination. This 
function of PTPN22 is independent of its phosphatase activity but requires R620. 
Our data not only establish a molecular link between PTPN22 and PAD-4, but also 
suggest that the C1858T SNP increases the risk of RA by enhancing protein 
citrullination and spontaneous formation of NETs.
