The Cys282-->Tyr mutation in the HFE gene is carried by the majority of 
hereditary hemochromatosis patient chromosomes, yet some patients do not seem to 
harbor any mutation in this gene. This suggests a possibility that these 
patients may have a mutation in other genes in the same pathway as HFE. We 
analyzed the cDNA sequences of transferrin receptor (TFR), which was recently 
shown to interact with HFE, in twenty-one hereditary hemochromatosis patients 
including sixteen individuals who did not carry a Cys282-->Tyr mutation. A 
nucleotide substitution (424A-->G), which resulted in the Ser142-->Gly amino 
acid substitution, was the only amino acid polymorphism detected in the open 
reading frame of the TFR gene in these patients. This amino acid substitution 
was a rather common polymorphism in the general population (49%) and its 
frequency did not significantly differ in the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) 
patients regardless of the HFE genotype. Thus, amino acid changes in the TFR 
gene do not appear to play a role in HH even when the patients do not have a HFE 
mutation. However, this study does not rule out the possibility of the 
involvement of mutations in non-coding regions.
