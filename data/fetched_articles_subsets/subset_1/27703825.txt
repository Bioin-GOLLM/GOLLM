Solitary epidural space metastasis of a malignant tumor is rare. We encountered 
a 79-year-old male patient with solitary metastatic epidural tumor who developed 
paraplegia and dysuria. The patient had undergone total gastrectomy for gastric 
cancer followed by chemotherapy 8 months priorly. The whole body was examined 
for suspected metastatic spinal tumor, but no metastases of the spine or 
important organs were observed, and a solitary mass was present in the thoracic 
spinal epidural space. The mass was excised for diagnosis and treatment and was 
histopathologically diagnosed as metastasis from gastric cancer. No solitary 
metastatic epidural tumor from gastric cancer has been reported in English. 
Among the Japanese, 3 cases have been reported, in which the outcome was poor in 
all cases and no definite diagnosis could be made before surgery in any case. 
Our patient developed concomitant pneumonia after surgery and died shortly after 
the surgery. When a patient has a past medical history of malignant tumor, the 
possibility of a solitary metastatic tumor in the epidural space should be 
considered.
