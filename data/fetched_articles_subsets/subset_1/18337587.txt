BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (ARHSP) with thin 
corpus callosum (TCC) is a common form of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia. 
The genetic lesion underlying ARHSP-TCC was localized to chromosome 15q13-q15 
and given the designation SPG11. Recently, the gene encoding spatacsin 
(KIAA1840) has been shown to contain mutations that underlie the majority of 
ARHSP-TCC cases.
METHODS: We present a complete analysis of the 40 coding exons of this gene in 
patients with sporadic (n = 25) or familial (20 probands) complex hereditary 
spastic paraplegia with and without thinning of the corpus callosum.
RESULTS: We identified seven mutations, including deletions, insertions, and 
nonsense mutations, which were all predicted to lead to premature truncation of 
the protein.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that mutations on KIAA1840 are frequent in complex 
autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia but an infrequent cause of 
sporadic complex hereditary spastic paraplegia.
