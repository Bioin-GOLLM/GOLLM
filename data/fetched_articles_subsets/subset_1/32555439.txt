Auditory neuropathy is an important entity in childhood sensorineural hearing 
loss. Due to diverse etiologies and clinical features, the management is often 
challenging. This study used an integrative patient-history, audiologic, 
genetic, and imaging-based approach to investigate the etiologies and audiologic 
features of 101 children with auditory neuropathy. Etiologically, 48 (47.5%), 16 
(15.8%), 11 (10.9%), and 26 (25.7%) children were categorized as having 
acquired, genetic, cochlear nerve deficiency-related, and indefinite auditory 
neuropathy, respectively. The most common causes of acquired and genetic 
auditory neuropathy were prematurity and OTOF mutations, respectively. Patients 
with acquired auditory neuropathy presented hearing loss earlier (odds ratio, 
10.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-47.4), whereas patients with genetic auditory 
neuropathy had higher presence rate of distortion product otoacoustic emissions 
(odds ratio, 10.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-85.4). In patients with 
different etiologies or pathological sites, moderate to strong correlations 
(Pearson's r = 0.51-0.83) were observed between behavioral thresholds and 
auditory steady-state response thresholds. In conclusion, comprehensive 
assessments can provide etiological clues in ~75% of the children with auditory 
neuropathy. Different etiologies are associated with different audiologic 
features, and auditory steady-state responses might serve as an objective 
measure for estimating behavioral thresholds.
