The mammalian DREAM complex is responsible for the transcriptional repression of 
hundreds of cell-cycle-related genes in quiescence. How the DREAM complex 
recruits chromatin-modifying entities to aid in its repression remains unknown. 
Using unbiased proteomics analysis, we have uncovered a robust association 
between the chromatin-associated Sin3B protein and the DREAM complex. We have 
determined that genetic inactivation of Sin3B results in the de-repression of 
DREAM target genes during quiescence but is insufficient to allow quiescent 
cells to resume proliferation. However, inactivation of APC/CCDH1 was sufficient 
for Sin3B-/- cells, but not parental cells, to re-enter the cell cycle. These 
studies identify Sin3B as a transcriptional corepressor associated with the 
DREAM complex in quiescence and reveals a functional cooperation between E2F 
target repression and APC/CCDH1 in the negative regulation of cell-cycle 
progression.
