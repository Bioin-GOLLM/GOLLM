Recent studies have shown that the Hippo-Salvador-Warts (HSW) pathway restrains 
tissue growth by phosphorylating and inactivating the oncoprotein Yorkie. How 
growth-suppressive signals are transduced upstream of Hippo remains unclear. We 
show that the Sterile 20 family kinase, Tao-1, directly phosphorylates T195 in 
the Hippo activation loop and that, like other HSW pathway genes, Tao-1 
functions to restrict cell proliferation in developing imaginal epithelia. This 
relationship appears to be evolutionarily conserved, because mammalian Tao-1 
similarly affects MST kinases. In S2 cells, Tao-1 mediates the effects of the 
upstream HSW components Merlin and Expanded, consistent with the idea that Tao-1 
functions in tissues to regulate Hippo phosphorylation. These results 
demonstrate that one family of Ste20 kinases can activate another and identify 
Tao-1 as a component of the regulatory network controlling HSW pathway 
signaling, and therefore tissue growth, during development.
