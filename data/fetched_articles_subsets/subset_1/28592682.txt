Over time, the long-lived proteins that are present throughout the human body 
deteriorate. Typically, they become racemized, truncated, and covalently 
cross-linked. One reaction responsible for age-related protein cross-linking in 
the lens was elucidated recently and shown to involve spontaneous formation of 
dehydroalanine (DHA) intermediates from phosphoserine. Cys residues are another 
potential source of DHA, and evidence for this was found in many lens 
crystallins. In the human lens, some sites were more prone to forming 
non-disulfide covalent cross-links than others. Foremost among them was Cys5 in 
βA4 crystallin. The reason for this enhanced reactivity was investigated using 
peptides. Oxidation of Cys to cystine was a prerequisite for DHA formation, and 
DHA production was accelerated markedly by the presence of a Lys, one residue 
separated from Cys5. Modeling and direct investigation of the N-terminal 
sequence of βA4 crystallin, as well as a variety of homologous peptides, showed 
that the epsilon amino group of Lys can promote DHA production by nucleophilic 
attack on the alpha proton of cystine. Once a DHA residue was generated, it 
could form intermolecular cross-links with Lys and Cys. In the lens, the most 
abundant cross-link involved Cys5 of βA4 crystallin attached via a thioether 
bond to glutathione. These findings illustrate the potential of Cys and 
disulfide bonds to act as precursors for irreversible covalent cross-links and 
the role of nearby amino acids in creating 'hotpsots' for the spontaneous 
processes responsible for protein degradation in aged tissues.
