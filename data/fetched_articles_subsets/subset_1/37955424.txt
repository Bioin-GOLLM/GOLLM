PURPOSE: Mutations in BTK, PLCG2, and BCL2 have been reported in patients with 
progressive disease (PD) on continuous single-agent BTK or BCL2 inhibitor 
treatment. We tested for these mutations in samples from patients with PD after 
completion of first-line treatment with fixed-duration ibrutinib plus venetoclax 
for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the phase II CAPTIVATE study.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 191 patients completed fixed-duration ibrutinib 
plus venetoclax (three cycles of ibrutinib then 12-13 cycles of ibrutinib plus 
venetoclax). Genomic risk features [del(11q), del(13q), del(17p), trisomy 12, 
complex karyotype, unmutated IGHV, TP53 mutated] and mutations in genes 
recurrently mutated in CLL (ATM, BIRC3, BRAF, CHD2, EZH2, FBXW7, MYD88, NOTCH1, 
POT1, RPS15, SF3B1, XPO1) were assessed at baseline in patients with and without 
PD at data cutoff; gene variants and resistance-associated mutations in BTK, 
PLCG2, or BCL2 were evaluated at PD.
RESULTS: Of 191 patients completing fixed-duration ibrutinib plus venetoclax, 
with median follow-up of 38.9 months, 29 (15%) developed PD. No baseline risk 
feature or gene mutation was significantly associated with development of PD. No 
previously reported resistance-associated mutations in BTK, PLCG2, or BCL2 were 
detected at PD in 25 patients with available samples. Of the 29 patients with 
PD, 19 have required retreatment (single-agent ibrutinib, n = 16, or ibrutinib 
plus venetoclax, n = 3); 17 achieved partial response or better, 1 achieved 
stable disease, and 1 is pending response assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: First-line fixed-duration combination treatment with ibrutinib plus 
venetoclax may mitigate development of resistance mechanisms associated with 
continuous single-agent targeted therapies, allowing for effective retreatment.
