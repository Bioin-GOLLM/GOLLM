BACKGROUND: UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) plays an important role in 
cardiovascular diseases and recent studies have suggested that the A55V 
polymorphism can cause UCP2 dysfunction. The main aim was to investigate the 
association of A55V polymorphism with cardiovascular events in a group of 611 
patients enrolled in the Medical, Angioplasty or Surgery Study II (MASS II), a 
randomized trial comparing treatments for patients with coronary artery disease 
and preserved left ventricular function.
METHODS: The participants of the MASS II were genotyped for the A55V 
polymorphism using allele-specific PCR assay. Survival curves were calculated 
with the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated with the log-rank statistic. The 
relationship between baseline variables and the composite end-point of cardiac 
death, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), refractory angina requiring 
revascularization and cerebrovascular accident were assessed using a Cox 
proportional hazards survival model.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences for baseline variables according 
genotypes. After 2 years of follow-up, dysglycemic patients harboring the VV 
genotype had higher occurrence of AMI (p=0.026), Death+AMI (p=0.033), new 
revascularization intervention (p=0.009) and combined events (p=0.037) as 
compared with patients carrying other genotypes. This association was not 
evident in normoglycemic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that A55V polymorphism is 
associated with UCP2 functional alterations that increase the risk of 
cardiovascular events in patients with previous coronary artery disease and 
dysglycemia.
