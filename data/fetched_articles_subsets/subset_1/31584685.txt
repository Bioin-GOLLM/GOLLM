IMPORTANCE: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are increasingly being 
identified in women of childbearing potential. Pregnancy in women with MPNs is 
associated with maternal thrombosis, hemorrhage, and placental dysfunction 
leading to fetal growth restriction or loss.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the use of aspirin, heparin, 
interferon, or combinations and live birth rate and adverse maternal outcomes in 
pregnant women with MPNs.
DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the 
MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations from 
inception to July 19, 2018, with no language restrictions, was conducted. Key 
search terms included myeloproliferative disorders, polycythemia vera, essential 
thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis.
STUDY SELECTION: A study was eligible if it included pregnant patients with 
MPNs; interventions included aspirin, heparin, and/or interferon; there was a 
comparison group in which patients did not receive the intervention; the study 
reported on at least 1 of the study outcomes; and it was a randomized, 
case-control, or cohort study or series of at least 10 pregnancies. Data were 
extracted in duplicate; 0.5% of identified studies met selection criteria.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The review was conducted according to Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and 
reported in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel 
approach.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes were the number of live births and maternal 
complications, specifically, arterial or venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, and 
preeclampsia.
RESULTS: Twenty-two studies reporting on 1210 pregnancies were included. The 
live birth rate was 71.3% (95% CI, 65.1%-77.6%). Use of aspirin (11 studies, 227 
patients; unadjusted odds ratio, 8.6; 95% CI, 4.0-18.1) and interferon (6 
studies, 90 patients; unadjusted odds ratio, 9.7; 95% CI, 2.3-41.0) were 
associated with higher odds of live birth. Addition of heparin to aspirin was 
not associated with higher odds of live birth (6 studies, 96 patients; 
unadjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.5-9.0). The most common adverse maternal 
event was preeclampsia, with an incidence of 3.1% (95% CI, 1.7%-4.5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most studies reported on pregnancy with essential 
thrombocythemia. Few studies reported on pregnancy with polycythemia vera and 
none with myelofibrosis met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were 
retrospective and early pregnancy losses may have been underreported. 
Moderate-quality evidence suggests that aspirin or interferon is associated with 
higher odds of live birth in pregnant women with MPN.
