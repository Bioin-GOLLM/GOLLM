The hemoglobin from the 4th-instar larva of Tokunagayusurika akamusi, a common 
midge found in eutrophic lakes in Japan, was composed of as many as 11 separable 
components (IA, IB, II, III, IV, V, VIA, VIB, VII, VIII, IX) on a DEAE-cellulose 
column. However, we have found that these components can be divided into two 
groups on the basis of their spectroscopic properties, one being named as the 
normal type (N-type) and the other being referred to as the low type (L-type). 
Since the major difference between them seemed to be the presence or absence of 
the distal (E7) histidine residue, which plays an important role in the 
stability properties of the bound dioxygen, the complete amino acid sequence was 
then determined for each typical component, namely, VII (N-type) and V (L-type): 
the former hemoglobin contained the usual distal histidine residue at position 
64, whereas the latter one replaced it by isoleucine at position 66. The 
homology test for 40 N-terminal amino acid residues of all components also 
demonstrates that T. akamusi hemoglobin is composed of two different clusters 
showing a very early separation in the phylogenetic tree.
