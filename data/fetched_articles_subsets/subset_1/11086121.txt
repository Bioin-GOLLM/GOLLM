Changes in co-receptor-use by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
strains are relatively rare in vivo. Here we describe two variants derived from 
the CCR5-using strain SF162, selected for replication in the C8166 T-cell line. 
Amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop conferred CXCR4-use; however, the loss 
of macrophage-tropism by one variant was due to a single mutation in the start 
codon of vpu. We discuss how V3 loop and vpu mutations acquired by replication 
in T-cell lines in vitro correlate with similar changes reported for primary 
isolates and HIV-1 sequences in vivo.
