FOXC1 loss contributes to Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), a common human 
cerebellar malformation. Previously, we found that complete Foxc1 loss leads to 
aberrations in proliferation, neuronal differentiation and migration in the 
embryonic mouse cerebellum (Haldipur et al., 2014). We now demonstrate that 
hypomorphic Foxc1 mutant mice have granule and Purkinje cell abnormalities 
causing subsequent disruptions in postnatal cerebellar foliation and lamination. 
Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobule 
which echoes the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging 
studies. Lineage tracing experiments in Foxc1 mutant mouse cerebella indicate 
that aberrant migration of granule cell progenitors destined to form the 
posterior-most lobule causes this unique phenotype. Analyses of rare human del 
chr 6p25 fetal cerebella demonstrate extensive phenotypic overlap with our Foxc1 
mutant mouse models, validating our DWM models and demonstrating that many key 
mechanisms controlling cerebellar development are likely conserved between mouse 
and human.
