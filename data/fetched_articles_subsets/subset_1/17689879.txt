The Neolithic period in Europe marked the transition from a hunter-gatherer diet 
rich in red meat to an iron-reduced cereal grain diet. This dietary shift likely 
resulted in an increased incidence of iron deficiency anemia, especially in 
women of reproductive age. I propose that hereditary hemochromatosis and in 
particular the common HFE C282Y mutation may represent an adaptation to 
decreased dietary iron in cereal grain-based Neolithic diets. Both homozygous 
and heterozygous carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation have increased iron stores 
and therefore possessed an adaptive advantage under Neolithic conditions. An 
allele age estimate places the origin of the HFE C282Y mutation in the early 
Neolithic period in Northern Europe and is thus consistent with this hypothesis. 
The lower incidence of this mutation in other agrarian regions (the 
Mediterranean and Near East) may be due to higher dietary intakes of the iron 
uptake cofactor vitamin C in those regions. The HFE C282Y mutation likely only 
became maladaptive in the past several centuries as dietary sources of iron and 
vitamin C improved in Northern Europe.
