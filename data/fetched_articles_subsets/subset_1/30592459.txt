Pneumococcal whole cell vaccines (WCVs) could cost-effectively protect against a 
greater strain diversity than current capsule-based vaccines. Immunoglobulin G 
(IgG) responses to a WCV were characterised by applying longitudinally-sampled 
sera, available from 35 adult placebo-controlled phase I trial participants, to 
a panproteome microarray. Despite individuals maintaining distinctive antibody 
'fingerprints', responses were consistent across vaccinated cohorts. Seventy-two 
functionally distinct proteins were associated with WCV-induced increases in IgG 
binding. These shared characteristics with naturally immunogenic proteins, being 
enriched for transporters and cell wall metabolism enzymes, likely unusually 
exposed on the unencapsulated WCV's surface. Vaccine-induced responses were 
specific to variants of the diverse PclA, PspC and ZmpB proteins, whereas PspA- 
and ZmpA-induced antibodies recognised a broader set of alleles. Temporal 
variation in IgG levels suggested a mixture of anamnestic and novel responses. 
These reproducible increases in IgG binding to a limited, but functionally 
diverse, set of conserved proteins indicate WCV could provide species-wide 
immunity. Clinical trial registration: The trial was registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov with Identifier NCT01537185; the results are available from 
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01537185.
