BACKGROUND: We examined the distributions of 22 immune cell types and the 
responses to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors according to EGFR mutation profile, in three 
independent datasets of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).
METHODS: We used CIBERSORTx to analyze the distributions of immune cells, and 
tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) or tumor mutation burden (TMB) to 
analyze responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, in two public LUAD datasets. The 
results were verified with a validation set that included patients treated with 
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.
RESULTS: Compared to EGFR mutants, EGFR wild-type carcinomas had higher numbers 
of CD8+ T cells, CD4 memory activated T cells and neutrophils, and lower numbers 
of resting dendritic cells and resting mast cells, in two of the datasets. In 
our subgroup analyses, CD8+ T cells and CD4 memory activated T cells were more 
numerous in EGFR rare variants than in wild-types, L858R mutants, and exon 19 
deletion mutants. In our TIDE or TMB analyses, EGFR rare variants were predicted 
to respond better to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors than wild-types, L858R mutants, and 
exon 19 deletion mutants. In the validation set verified by immunohistochemical 
staining, levels of CD8+ T cells in the EGFR rare variant or wild-type groups 
were significantly higher than in the EGFR L858R and exon 19 deletion groups. In 
patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, the survival rates of patients with 
EGFR wild-type and rare mutant carcinomas were higher than those with L858R and 
exon 19 deletion carcinomas.
CONCLUSION: The EGFR rare mutation form of LUAD shows a higher immune activation 
state compared to wild-type, L858R, and exon 19 deletion variants, indicating it 
as a potential target for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.
