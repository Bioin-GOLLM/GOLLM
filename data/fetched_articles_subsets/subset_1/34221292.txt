Secondary polycythemia (SP) occurs as a result of increase erythropoietin levels 
most commonly as a result of tissue hypoxia. Symptoms such as erythromelalgia, 
pruritis, and bleeding, which are frequently seen in polycythemia vera (PV), do 
not commonly occur in SP. Phlebotomy is considered one of the mainstays of 
therapy for PV but is rarely used for treatment of SP due to concern about 
worsening tissue hypoxia. We present the case of a patient with severe SP due to 
chronic hypoxic lung disease who presented with erythromelalgia, pruritis, and 
bleeding and was treated successfully with therapeutic phlebotomy. This case 
illustrates the importance of considering the use of therapeutic phlebotomy in 
symptomatic patients with severe SP.
