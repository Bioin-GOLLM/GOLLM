OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to access the prevalence of 
alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
histology in the general population, which had been otherwise difficult to 
access because of inherent misclassification bias in surrogate marker studies 
and referral bias in patient case series. The interaction among rs738409, 
obesity, and alcohol remains controversial. This population-based autopsy study 
investigated the histological prevalence of ALD and NAFLD, and interactions 
among rs738409, obesity, and alcoholism.
METHODS: A total of 170 alcoholic and 235 nonalcoholic cases were selected from 
1,034 adult car accident autopsies in 17 Kansas and Missouri counties from 2000 
to 2010. The nonalcoholic group had undetectable blood alcohol concentration, 
while the alcoholic group had a blood alcohol concentration â‰¥0.08%.
RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalences of hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, 
and advanced fibrosis were 56, 6, and 18% among alcoholics and 36, 4, and 6% in 
nonalcoholics, respectively. The interaction terms among alcohol, body mass 
index (BMI), and genotype were not significant. rs738409 GC or GG genotype was 
associated with 1.9-fold odds (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.9) of a 
higher NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). Alcohol had 3.5-fold odds (95% CI, 2.0-5.9), 
while every 5-unit increase in BMI had 1.9-fold odds (95% CI, 1.7-2.5). A 
negative interaction between alcohol and BMI towards fibrosis had been observed 
(P=0.045). Every 5-unit increase in BMI had 2.2-fold odds (95% CI, 1.5-2.5) of 
fibrosis among nonalcoholics, but not in alcoholics.
CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the prevalence of fatty liver histology in the 
general population from an autopsy study perspective. The finding of an additive 
interaction among rs738409, obesity, and alcohol towards NAS may be useful in 
targeting preventative care to patients at highest risk for ALD. The negative 
interaction between alcohol and obesity towards fibrosis supported previous 
findings and suggests the need for future research to explore potential 
mechanisms that may improve treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related 
fibrosis.
