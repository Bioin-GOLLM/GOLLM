IMPORTANCE: Clinical exome sequencing (CES) is rapidly becoming a common 
molecular diagnostic test for individuals with rare genetic disorders.
OBJECTIVE: To report on initial clinical indications for CES referrals and 
molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and for different test 
types.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical exome sequencing was performed on 
814 consecutive patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions at the 
University of California, Los Angeles, Clinical Genomics Center between January 
2012 and August 2014. Clinical exome sequencing was conducted as trio-CES (both 
parents and their affected child sequenced simultaneously) to effectively detect 
de novo and compound heterozygous variants or as proband-CES (only the affected 
individual sequenced) when parental samples were not available.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical indications for CES requests, molecular 
diagnostic rates of CES overall and for phenotypic subgroups, and differences in 
molecular diagnostic rates between trio-CES and proband-CES.
RESULTS: Of the 814 cases, the overall molecular diagnosis rate was 26% (213 of 
814; 95% CI, 23%-29%). The molecular diagnosis rate for trio-CES was 31% (127 of 
410 cases; 95% CI, 27%-36%) and 22% (74 of 338 cases; 95% CI, 18%-27%) for 
proband-CES. In cases of developmental delay in children (<5 years, n = 138), 
the molecular diagnosis rate was 41% (45 of 109; 95% CI, 32%-51%) for trio-CES 
cases and 9% (2 of 23, 95% CI, 1%-28%) for proband-CES cases. The significantly 
higher diagnostic yield (P value =â€‰.002; odds ratio, 7.4 [95% CI, 1.6-33.1]) of 
trio-CES was due to the identification of de novo and compound heterozygous 
variants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this sample of patients with undiagnosed, 
suspected genetic conditions, trio-CES was associated with higher molecular 
diagnostic yield than proband-CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. 
Additional studies designed to validate these findings and to explore the effect 
of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted.
