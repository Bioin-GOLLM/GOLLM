Genomic profiles of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are 
still insufficiently understood, and the genetic alterations associated with 
drug responses have not been studied. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing 
of 12 GEP-NETs from patients enrolled in a nonrandomized, open-labeled, 
single-center phase II study for pazopanib, and integrated our results with 
previously published results on pancreas (n = 12) and small intestine NETs (n = 
50). The mean numbers of somatic mutations in each case varied widely from 20 to 
4682. Among 12 GEP-NETs, eight showed mutations of more than one cancer-related 
gene, including TP53, CNBD1, RB1, APC, BCOR, BRAF, CTNNB1, EGFR, EP300, ERBB3, 
KDM6A, KRAS, MGA, MLL3, PTEN, RASA1, SMARCB1, SPEN, TBC1D12, and VHL. TP53 was 
recurrently mutated in three cases, whereas CNBD1 and RB1 mutations were 
identified in two cases. Three GEP-NET patients with TP53 mutations demonstrated 
a durable response and one small intestinal grade (G) 1 NET patient with BRAF 
V600E mutation showed progression after pazopanib treatment. We found BRAF V600E 
(G1 NET from rectum and two G3 NETs from colon) and BRAF G593S (G2 NET from 
pancreas) missense mutations (9.1%) in an independent cohort of 44 GEP-NETs from 
the rectum (n = 26), colon (n = 7), pancreas (n = 4), small intestine (n = 3), 
stomach (n = 3) and appendix (n = 1) by Sanger sequencing. All tumor specimens 
were obtained before chemotherapy. In conclusion, BRAF V600E mutation is likely 
to result in resistance to pazopanib but may be a potentianally actionable 
mutation in metastatic GEP-NETs patients.
