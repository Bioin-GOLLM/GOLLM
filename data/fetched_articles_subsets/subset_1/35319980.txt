The mechanisms underlying memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease and 
related dementias (ADRD) remain unclear, and no effective treatments exist. 
Fundamental studies have shown that a set of transcriptional regulatory proteins 
of the nuclear receptor 4a (Nr4a) family serve as molecular switches for 
long-term memory. Here, we show that Nr4a proteins regulate the transcription of 
genes encoding chaperones that localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These 
chaperones fold and traffic plasticity-related proteins to the cell surface 
during long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and memory. Dysregulation of 
Nr4a transcription factors and ER chaperones is linked to ADRD, and 
overexpressing Nr4a1 or the chaperone Hspa5 ameliorates long-term memory 
deficits in a tau-based mouse model of ADRD, pointing toward innovative 
therapeutic approaches for treating memory loss. Our findings establish a unique 
molecular concept underlying long-term memory and provide insights into the 
mechanistic basis of cognitive deficits in dementia.
