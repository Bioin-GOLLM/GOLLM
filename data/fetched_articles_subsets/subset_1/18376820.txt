Thiolate and selenolate complexes of CYP101 (P450cam) and the H25A proximal 
cavity mutant of heme-bound human heme oxygenase-1 (hHO-1) have been examined by 
UV-vis spectroscopy. Both thiolate and selenolate ligands bound to the heme 
distal side in CYP101 and gave rise to characteristic hyperporphyrin spectra. 
Thiolate ligands also bound to the proximal side of the heme in the cavity 
created by the H25A mutation in hHO-1, giving a Soret absorption similar to that 
of the H25C hHO-1 mutant. Selenolate ligands also bound to this cavity mutant 
under anaerobic conditions but reduced the heme iron to the ferrous state, as 
shown by the formation of a ferrous CO complex. Under aerobic conditions, the 
selenolate ligand but not the thiolate ligand was rapidly oxidized. These 
results indicate that selenocysteine-coordinated heme proteins will not be 
stable species in the absence of a redox potential stabilizing effect.
