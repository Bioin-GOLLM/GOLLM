Hypertensive cardiac remodeling is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy 
and interstitial fibrosis, which can lead to heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction. The Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs) are 
members of the serine/threonine protein kinase family, which mediates the 
downstream effects of the small GTP-binding protein RhoA. There are 2 isoforms: 
ROCK1 and ROCK2. They have different functions in different types of cells and 
tissues. There is growing evidence that ROCKs contribute to the development of 
cardiovascular diseases, including cardiac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and subsequent 
heart failure. Recent experimental studies using ROCK inhibitors, such as 
fasudil, have shown the benefits of ROCK inhibition in cardiac remodeling. Mice 
lacking each ROCK isoform also exhibit reduced myocardial fibrosis in a variety 
of pathological models of cardiac remodeling. Indeed, clinical studies with 
fasudil have suggested that ROCKs could be potential novel therapeutic targets 
for cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we summarize the current 
understanding of the roles of ROCKs in the development of cardiac fibrosis and 
hypertrophy and discuss their therapeutic potential for deleterious cardiac 
remodeling. (Circ J 2016; 80: 1491-1498).
