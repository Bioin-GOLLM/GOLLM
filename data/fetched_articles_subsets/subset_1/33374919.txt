A sesquiterpene lactone, thapsigargin, is a phytochemical found in the roots and 
fruits of Mediterranean plants from Thapsia L. species that have been used for 
centuries in folk medicine to treat rheumatic pain, lung diseases, and female 
infertility. More recently thapsigargin was found to be a potent cytotoxin that 
induces apoptosis by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ 
ATPase (SERCA) pump, which is necessary for cellular viability. This biological 
activity encouraged studies on the use of thapsigargin as a novel antineoplastic 
agent, which were, however, hampered due to high toxicity of this compound to 
normal cells. In this review, we summarized the recent knowledge on the 
biological activity and molecular mechanisms of thapsigargin action and advances 
in the synthesis of less-toxic thapsigargin derivatives that are being developed 
as novel anticancer drugs.
