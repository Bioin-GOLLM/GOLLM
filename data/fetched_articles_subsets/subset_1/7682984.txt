We have screened the 27 exons of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator gene in 87 non-delta F508 chromosomes of Breton origin using the 
combined techniques of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and direct 
sequencing. By this process, we have detected a new missense mutation, G91R, 
which results in an arginine for glycine at codon 91. Three affected patients 
with a delta F508/G91R genotype are pancreatic sufficient. Such observations 
could facilitate a better understanding of the functional importance of 
different regions of the encoded product and of the pathogenesis of the disease.
