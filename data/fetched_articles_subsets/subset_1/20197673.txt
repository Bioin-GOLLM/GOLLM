BACKGROUND: P450c17 has two distinct activities: 17alpha-hydroxylase activity 
and 17,20-lyase activity. Combined 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency 
leads to a severe defect in the production of cortisol and sex steroids. In 
affected males this results in impaired masculinization with ambiguous or female 
external genitalia. Female patients have normal genitalia but show a lack of 
pubertal development in adolescence. An increased production of 
mineralocorticoids often leads to hypertension and hypokalemia in both sexes.
METHODS: To better understand the mechanisms of P450c17 deficiency, we studied 2 
patients (both 46,XY) with combined 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency 
of different severity: one with complete lack of masculinization and one with 
ambiguous genitalia.
RESULTS: Four mutations were identified by sequencing of the CYP17A1 gene: I332T 
and A355T in the less severely affected patient; G111S and R440H in the patient 
with complete lack of masculinization. The three novel mutations were expressed 
in COS1 cells and all mutant proteins except I332T showed a complete loss of 
both enzymatic activities. I332T retained some residual 17alpha-hydroxylase as 
well as 17,20-lyase activity.
CONCLUSION: We identified 2 patients with the phenotypical spectrum of P450c17 
deficiency. Three novel mutations in the CYP17A1 gene were identified and their 
functional characterization provided a good phenotype-genotype correlation. The 
location of the mutated residues in the three-dimensional model of P450c17 gave 
some additional insights into its structure-function relationship.
