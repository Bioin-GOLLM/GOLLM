Transcription initiation is a key regulatory step in gene expression during 
which RNA polymerase (RNAP) initiates RNA synthesis de novo, and the synthesized 
RNA at a specific length triggers the transition to the elongation phase. 
Mitochondria recruit a single-subunit RNAP and one or two auxiliary factors to 
initiate transcription. Previous studies have revealed the molecular 
architectures of yeast1 and human2 mitochondrial RNAP initiation 
complexes (ICs). Here we provide a comprehensive, stepwise mechanism of 
transcription initiation by solving high-resolution cryogenic electron 
microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of yeast mitochondrial RNAP and the 
transcription factor Mtf1 catalysing two- to eight-nucleotide RNA synthesis at 
single-nucleotide addition steps. The growing RNA-DNA is accommodated in the 
polymerase cleft by template scrunching and non-template reorganization, 
creating stressed intermediates. During early initiation, non-template strand 
scrunching and unscrunching destabilize the short two- and three-nucleotide 
RNAs, triggering abortive synthesis. Subsequently, the non-template reorganizes 
into a base-stacked staircase-like structure supporting processive five- to 
eight-nucleotide RNA synthesis. The expanded non-template staircase and highly 
scrunched template in IC8 destabilize the promoter interactions with Mtf1 to 
facilitate initiation bubble collapse and promoter escape for the transition 
from initiation to the elongation complex (EC). The series of transcription 
initiation steps, each guided by the interplay of multiple structural 
components, reveal a finely tuned mechanism for potential regulatory control.
