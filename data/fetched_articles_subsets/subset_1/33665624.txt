Small-molecule inhibitors have been instrumental in uncovering the biological 
importance of poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), a family of enzymes involved 
in wide-ranging aspects of cell biology. However, few PARP inhibitors are tested 
against the entire family of PARPs. This makes it impossible to confidently 
assess the role of a single PARP in cellular processes using small molecules. 
Here, we detail a PARP activity screening and inhibitor testing assay (PASTA) 
for determining relative selectivity of PARP inhibitors. For complete details on 
the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Kirby et al. (2018).
