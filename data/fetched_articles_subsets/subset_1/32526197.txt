Here, we perform a genome-wide screen for variants that regulate the expression 
of gene co-expression modules in the aging human brain; we discover and 
replicate such variants in the TMEM106B and RBFOX1 loci. The TMEM106B haplotype 
is known to influence the accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa 
(TDP-43) proteinopathy, and the haplotype's large-scale transcriptomic effects 
include the dysregulation of lysosomal genes and alterations in synaptic gene 
splicing that are also seen in the pathophysiology of TDP-43 proteinopathy. 
Further, a variant near GRN, another TDP-43 proteinopathy susceptibility gene, 
shows concordant effects with the TMEM106B haplotype. Leveraging neuropathology 
data from the same participants, we also show that TMEM106B and APOE-amyloid-β 
effects converge to alter myelination and lysosomal gene expression, which then 
contributes to TDP-43 accumulation. These results advance our mechanistic 
understanding of the TMEM106B TDP-43 risk haplotype and uncover a 
transcriptional program that mediates the converging effects of APOE-amyloid-β 
and TMEM106B on TDP-43 aggregation in older adults.
