Fatty liver disease (FLD) caused by metabolic dysfunction is the leading cause 
of liver disease and the prevalence is rising, especially in women. Although 
during reproductive age women are protected against FLD, for still unknown and 
understudied reasons some develop rapidly progressive disease at the menopause. 
The patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) p.I148M variant 
accounts for the largest fraction of inherited FLD variability. In the present 
study, we show that there is a specific multiplicative interaction between 
female sex and PNPLA3 p.I148M in determining FLD in at-risk individuals 
(steatosis and fibrosis, P < 10-10; advanced fibrosis/hepatocellular carcinoma, 
P = 0.034) and in the general population (P < 10-7 for alanine transaminase 
levels). In individuals with obesity, hepatic PNPLA3 expression was higher in 
women than in men (P = 0.007) and in mice correlated with estrogen levels. In 
human hepatocytes and liver organoids, PNPLA3 was induced by estrogen receptor-α 
(ER-α) agonists. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays, we 
identified and characterized an ER-α-binding site within a PNPLA3 enhancer and 
demonstrated via CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing that this sequence drives PNPLA3 
p.I148M upregulation, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and fibrogenesis in 
three-dimensional multilineage spheroids with stellate cells. These data suggest 
that a functional interaction between ER-α and PNPLA3 p.I148M variant 
contributes to FLD in women.
