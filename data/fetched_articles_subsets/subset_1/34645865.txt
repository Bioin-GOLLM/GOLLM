Enzyme engineering approaches have allowed to extend the collection of enzymatic 
tools available for synthetic purposes. However, controlling the 
regioselectivity of the reaction remains challenging, in particular when dealing 
with carbohydrates bearing numerous reactive hydroxyl groups as substrates. 
Here, we used a computer-aided design framework to engineer the active site of a 
sucrose-active [Formula: see text]-transglucosylase for the 
1,2-cis-glucosylation of a lightly protected chemically synthesized 
tetrasaccharide, a common precursor for the synthesis of serotype-specific S. 
flexneri O-antigen fragments. By targeting 27 amino acid positions of the 
acceptor binding subsites of a GH70 branching sucrase, we used a 
RosettaDesign-based approach to propose 49 mutants containing up to 15 mutations 
scattered over the active site. Upon experimental evaluation, these mutants were 
found to produce up to six distinct pentasaccharides, whereas only two were 
synthesized by the parental enzyme. Interestingly, we showed that by introducing 
specific mutations in the active site of a same enzyme scaffold, it is possible 
to control the regiospecificity of the 1,2-cis glucosylation of the 
tetrasaccharide acceptor and produce a unique diversity of pentasaccharide 
bricks. This work offers novel opportunities for the development of highly 
convergent chemo-enzymatic routes toward S. flexneri haptens.
