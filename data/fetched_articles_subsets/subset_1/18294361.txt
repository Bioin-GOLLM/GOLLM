Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) is a group of diseases characterized by a persistent 
elevation of phenylalanine levels in tissues and biological fluids. The most 
frequent form is phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, causing phenylketonuria 
(PKU). Among 159 Israeli patients (Jews, Muslim and Christian Arabs and Druze) 
with HPA, in whom at least one of the mutations was characterized, a total of 43 
different mutations were detected, including seven novel ones. PKU was very rare 
among Ashkenazi Jews and relatively frequent among Jews from Yemen, the 
Caucasian Mountains, Bukhara and Tunisia. The mutations responsible for the high 
frequency were: exon3del (Yemenite Jews), L48S (Tunisian Jews) and E178G, P281L 
and L48S (Jews from the Caucasian Mountains and Bukhara). Among the non-Jewish 
Israeli citizens, the disease was relatively frequent in the Negev and in the 
Nazareth vicinity, and in many localities a unique mutation was detected, often 
in a single family. While marked genetic heterogeneity was observed in the Arab 
and Jewish populations, only one mutation A300S, was frequent in all of the 
communities. Several of the other frequent mutations were shared by the 
non-Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs; none were mutual to Ashkenazi Jews and Arabs.
