Despite Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence being projected to increase 
worldwide, the drugs currently on the market can only mitigate symptoms. 
Considering the failures of the classical paradigm "one target-one drug-one 
disease" in delivering effective medications for AD, polypharmacology appears to 
be a most viable therapeutic strategy. Polypharmacology can involve combinations 
of multiple drugs and/or single chemical entities modulating multiple targets. 
Taking inspiration from an ongoing clinical trial, this work aims to convert a 
promising cromolyn-ibuprofen drug combination into single-molecule "codrugs." 
Such codrugs should be able to similarly modulate neuroinflammatory and amyloid 
pathways, while showing peculiar pros and cons. By exploiting a linking 
strategy, we designed and synthesized a small set of cromolyn-ibuprofen 
conjugates (4-6). Preliminary plasma stability and neurotoxicity assays allowed 
us to select diamide 5 and ethanolamide 6 as promising compounds for further 
studies. We investigated their immunomodulatory profile in immortalized 
microglia cells, in vitro anti-aggregating activity towards Aβ42-amyloid 
self-aggregation, and their cellular neuroprotective effect against Aβ42-induced 
neurotoxicity. The fact that 6 effectively reduced Aβ-induced neuronal death, 
prompted its investigation into an in vivo model. Notably, 6 was demonstrated to 
significantly increase the longevity of Aβ42-expressing Drosophila and to 
improve fly locomotor performance.
