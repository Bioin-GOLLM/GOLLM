Identification of mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient colorectal cancers (CRCs) is 
recommended for Lynch syndrome (LS) screening, and supports targeting of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis is commonly 
used to test for MMR deficiency. Testing biopsies prior to tumour resection can 
inform surgical and therapeutic decisions, but can be limited by DNA quantity. 
MSI analysis of voided urine could also provide much needed surveillance for 
genitourinary tract cancers in LS. Here, we reconfigure an existing molecular 
inversion probe-based MSI and BRAF c.1799T > A assay to a multiplex PCR (mPCR) 
format, and demonstrate that it can sample >140 unique molecules per marker from 
<1 ng of DNA and classify CRCs with 96−100% sensitivity and specificity. We also 
show that it can detect increased MSI within individual and composite CRC 
biopsies from LS patients, and within preoperative urine cell free DNA (cfDNA) 
from two LS patients, one with an upper tract urothelial cancer, the other an 
undiagnosed endometrial cancer. Approximately 60−70% of the urine cfDNAs were 
tumour-derived. Our results suggest that mPCR sequence-based analysis of MSI and 
mutation hotspots in CRC biopsies could facilitate presurgery decision making, 
and could enable postal-based screening for urinary tract and endometrial 
tumours in LS patients.
