Most spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) result from replication-fork 
breakage. Break-induced replication (BIR), a genome rearrangement-prone repair 
mechanism that requires the Pol32/POLD3 subunit of eukaryotic DNA Polδ, was 
proposed to repair broken forks, but how genome destabilization is avoided was 
unknown. We show that broken fork repair initially uses error-prone 
Pol32-dependent synthesis, but that mutagenic synthesis is limited to within a 
few kilobases from the break by Mus81 endonuclease and a converging fork. Mus81 
suppresses template switches between both homologous sequences and diverged 
human Alu repetitive elements, highlighting its importance for stability of 
highly repetitive genomes. We propose that lack of a timely converging fork or 
Mus81 may propel genome instability observed in cancer.
