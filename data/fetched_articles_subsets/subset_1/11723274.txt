OBJECTIVE: To examine the functional consequences of episodic ataxia type 2 
(EA2)-causing nonsense and missense mutations in vitro and to characterize the 
basis of fluctuating weakness in patients with E2A.
BACKGROUND: Mutations in CACNA1A encoding the Ca(v)2.1 calcium channel subunit 
cause EA2 through incompletely understood mechanisms. Although the Ca(v)2.1 
subunit is important for neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction, 
weakness has not been considered a feature of EA2.
METHODS: The disease-causing mutations in three unrelated patients with EA2 and 
fluctuating weakness were identified by mutation screening and sequencing. 
Mutant constructs harboring mutations R1281X, F1406C, R1549X were transfected 
into COS7 cells and expressed for patch clamp studies. Single-fiber 
electromyography (SFEMG) was performed in patients to examine synaptic 
transmission at the neuromuscular junction.
RESULTS: Functional studies in COS7 cells of nonsense and missense EA2 mutants 
demonstrated markedly decreased current densities compared with wild type. SFEMG 
demonstrated jitter and blocking in these patients with EA2, compared with 
normal subjects and three patients with SCA-6.
CONCLUSION: EA2-causing missense and nonsense mutations in CACNA1A produced 
mutant channels with diminished whole cell calcium channel activity in vitro due 
to loss of function. Altered biophysical properties or reduced efficiency of 
plasma membrane targeting of mutant channels may contribute to abnormal 
neuromuscular transmission, manifesting as myasthenic syndrome.
