Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is occasionally complicated in patients with 
familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). However, there have been no reports of 
FIP patients with DC that develop acute exacerbation (AE). We herein report a 
FIP patient with DC that showed AE of FIP after influenza virus B infection. 
Although DC is a rare disease in clinical practice, physicians should keep in 
mind that FIP combined with DC has the potential to cause AE.
