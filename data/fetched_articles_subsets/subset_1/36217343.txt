Psittacosis is a rare zoonotic disease caused by Chlamydia psittaci infection, 
and tetracyclines are the preferred treatment. Omadacycline is a novel 
tetracycline that has a strong in vitro antibacterial activity against atypical 
pathogens, including C. psittaci; however, clinical data for its usage are 
lacking. We report a patient with severe C. psittaci-induced pneumonia 
presenting with a high fever, muscle aches, severe hepatic and renal 
insufficiency, and acute respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and 
mechanical ventilation. The condition was diagnosed using metagenomic 
next-generation sequencing. The patient was discharged after treatment with 
omadacycline. The findings of this study suggest that metagenomic 
next-generation sequencing is valuable for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of 
psittacosis. With its good safety profile and no requirement for dose adjustment 
in special populations, omadacycline is a new option for the treatment of severe 
C. psittaci pneumonia. However, additional case reports are needed to support 
this conclusion.
