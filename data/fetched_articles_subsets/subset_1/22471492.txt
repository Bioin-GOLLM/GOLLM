OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase gene 
(OGG1) Ser326Cys polymorphism with gastric cancer via a comprehensive 
meta-analysis.
METHODS: A total of 12 publications were identified before January 20, 2011 
including 1,390 cases and 3,299 controls. A random-effects model was applied 
irrespective of between-study heterogeneity. Data and study quality were 
assessed in duplicate.
RESULTS: No significant association was found for either allele or genotype with 
gastric cancer (odds ratio [OR]=0.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 
0.82-1.13; P=0.66), and this was also the case after combining 326Ser/Cys and 
326Ser/Ser genotypes together (OR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.63-1.20; P=0.40), or 
326Cys/Cys and 326Ser/Cys together (OR=1.03; 95% CI: 0.87-1.22; P=0.72). 
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that comparison of allele 326Ser versus 
326Cys generated a weakly and non-significant protective effect on gastric 
cancer in Asians (OR=0.90; 95% CI: 0.75-1.09; P=0.29) and Turks (OR=0.65; 95% 
CI: 0.37-1.14; P=0.13), but a non-significant risk effect in Europeans (OR=1.10; 
95% CI: 0.78-1.54; P=0.60) and Brazilians (OR=1.13; 95% CI: 0.81-1.58; P=0.48). 
No publication bias was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results collectively suggest that the OGG1 Ser326Cys 
polymorphism might not be a potential candidate risk factor for the development 
of gastric cancer.
