Emerging evidence suggests that crosstalk between hematologic tumor cells and 
the tumor microenvironment contributes to leukemia and lymphoma cell migration, 
survival, and proliferation. The supportive tumor cell-microenvironment 
interactions and the resulting cellular processes require adaptations and 
modulations of the cytoskeleton. The Rac subfamily of the Rho family GTPases 
includes key regulators of the cytoskeleton, with essential functions in both 
normal and transformed leukocytes. Rac proteins function downstream of receptor 
tyrosine kinases, chemokine receptors, and integrins, orchestrating a multitude 
of signals arising from the microenvironment. As such, it is not surprising that 
deregulation of Rac expression and activation plays a role in the development 
and progression of hematological malignancies. In this review, we will give an 
overview of the specific contribution of the deregulation of Rac GTPases in 
hematologic malignancies.
