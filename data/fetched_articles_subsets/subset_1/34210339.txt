BACKGROUND: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, highly heterogeneous 
genetic disorder involving the impairment of motile cilia. With no single gold 
standard for PCD diagnosis and complicated multiorgan dysfunction, the diagnosis 
of PCD can be difficult in clinical settings. Some methods for diagnosis, such 
as nasal nitric oxide measurement and digital high-speed video microscopy with 
ciliary beat pattern analysis, can be expensive or unavailable. To confirm PCD 
diagnosis, we used a strategy combining assessment of typical symptoms with 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) and/or low-pass whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as an 
unbiased detection tool to identify known pathogenic mutations, novel 
variations, and copy number variations.
RESULTS: A total of 26 individuals of Chinese origin with a confirmed PCD 
diagnosis aged 13 to 61 years (median age, 24.5 years) were included. Biallelic 
pathogenic mutations were identified in 19 of the 26 patients, including 8 
recorded HGMD mutations and 24 novel mutations. The detection rate reached 
73.1%. DNAH5 was the most frequently mutated gene, and c.8383C > T was the most 
common mutated variant, but it is relatively rare in PCD patients from other 
ethnic groups.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the practical clinical utility of combining 
WES and low-pass WGS as a no-bias detecting tool in adult patients with PCD, 
showing a clinical characteristics and genetic spectrum of Chinese PCD patients.
