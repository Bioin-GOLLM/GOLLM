BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence imply that brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF) is involved in the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia (FM); in this 
regard, patients with FM have altered blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of 
BDNF. In this study, we explored the association between BDNF gene polymorphisms 
and FM susceptibility and the severity of symptoms.
METHODS: In total, 409 patients with FM and 423 healthy controls in 10 medical 
centers were enrolled from the Korean nationwide FM survey. The alleles and 
genotypes at 10 positions in the BDNF gene were genotyped.
RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of BDNF rs11030104 differed 
significantly between the patients with FM and the controls (P = 0.031). The GG 
genotype of rs11030104 had a protective effect against FM (P = 0.016), and the G 
allele of rs11030104 was negatively associated with the presence of FM compared 
with the A allele (P = 0.013). In comparison, although the allele and genotype 
frequencies of BDNF rs12273539 did not differ between the two groups, the TT 
genotype of BDNF rs12273539 was associated with susceptibility to FM 
(P = 0.038). Haplotype analyses implied that some BDNF haplotypes have a 
protective effect against FM. Finally, several genotypes and haplotypes of the 
BDNF gene contributed to specific symptoms of FM.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate the associations between BDNF 
gene polymorphisms and FM. Our results imply that some BDNF single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms and haplotypes are associated with susceptibility to, and 
contribute to the symptoms of, FM.

study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants at the time of recruitment. 
Exactly the same informed consult form (ICF) and study protocol were provided to 
the independent Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) at each 
medical center, and each IRB/EC reviewed the appropriateness of the protocol and 
risks and benefits to the study participants. Ultimately, the IRB/EC at each 
medical center independently approved this study without revision of the ICF or 
study protocol. CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Not applicable. COMPETING INTERESTS:
