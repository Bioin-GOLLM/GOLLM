Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) were shown to orchestrate tumour-promoting 
inflammation in multiple malignancies, including breast cancer. However, the 
molecular pathways that govern the inflammatory role of CAFs are poorly 
characterised. In this study we found that fibroblasts sense damage-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs), and in response activate the NLRP3 inflammasome 
pathway, resulting in instigation of pro-inflammatory signalling and secretion 
of IL-1β. This upregulation was evident in CAFs in mouse and in human breast 
carcinomas. Moreover, CAF-derived inflammasome signalling facilitated tumour 
growth and metastasis, which was attenuated when NLRP3 or IL-1β were 
specifically ablated. Functionally, CAF-derived inflammasome promoted tumour 
progression and metastasis by modulating the tumour microenvironment towards an 
immune suppressive milieu and by upregulating the expression of adhesion 
molecules on endothelial cells. Our findings elucidate a mechanism by which CAFs 
promote breast cancer progression and metastasis, by linking the physiological 
tissue damage response of fibroblasts with tumour-promoting inflammation.
