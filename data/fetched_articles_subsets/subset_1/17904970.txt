OBJECTIVE: Heritable thrombophilias have been implicated as a potential cause of 
abruption by vascular disruption at the uteroplacental interface. Polymorphisms 
of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been linked to 
vascular complications outside of pregnancy, which includes stroke. Given the 
underlying thrombotic nature of abruption, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in 
the MTHFR gene are associated with abruption.
STUDY DESIGN: We examined 2 variants in MTHFR: 677C-->T and 1298A-->C in genomic 
DNA extracted from maternal blood from the New Jersey-Placental Abruption Study, 
an ongoing, multicenter case-controlled study. We identified 195 women with a 
clinical diagnosis of abruption (cases) and 189 control subjects who were 
matched on race/ethnicity and parity. We assessed allele and genotype 
frequencies and their associations with abruption risk after adjusting for 
confounders through multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The wild-type allele (C) frequency of the 677C-->T variant of MTHFR 
among cases and control subjects was 69.0% and 64.3%, respectively; the 
wild-type allele (A) of the 1298A-->C variant was 75.9% and 79.4%, respectively. 
Distributions of the 677C-->T alleles among control subjects violated the 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = .007); distributions of the 1298A-->C alleles 
were in equilibrium (P = .825). In comparison to the wild-type genotype (C/C), 
the homozygous mutant form (T/T) of 677C-->T was not associated with abruption 
(odds ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-1.18). Similarly, the 
homozygous mutant form (C/C) of the 1298A-->C polymorphism was distributed 
equally between cases and control subjects (odds ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 
0.82-6.35). Plasma homocysteine and vitamin B12, but not folate, concentrations 
were elevated in cases compared with control subjects among women with the 
wild-type genotype of MTHFR 677C-->T (P = .039 for homocysteine; P = .048 for 
B12; P = .224 for folate).
CONCLUSION: In this population, neither heterozygosity nor homozygosity for the 
677C-->T and 1298A-->C variants in MTHFR was associated with placental 
abruption.
