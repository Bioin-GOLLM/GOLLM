A novel, cold-adapted, and acid-base stable manganese superoxide dismutase 
(Ps-Mn-SOD) was cloned from hadal sea cucumber Paelopatides sp. The dimeric 
recombinant enzyme exhibited approximately 60 kDa in molecular weight, expressed 
activity from 0 °C to 70 °C with an optimal temperature of 0 °C, and resisted 
wide pH values from 2.2⁻13.0 with optimal activity (> 70%) at pH 5.0⁻12.0. The 
Km and Vmax of Ps-Mn-SOD were 0.0329 ± 0.0040 mM and 9112 ± 248 U/mg, 
respectively. At tested conditions, Ps-Mn-SOD was relatively stable in divalent 
metal ion and other chemicals, such as β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, Tween 
20, Triton X-100, and Chaps. Furthermore, the enzyme showed striking stability 
in 5 M urea or 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, resisted digestion by proteases, and 
tolerated a high hydrostatic pressure of 100 MPa. The resistance of Ps-Mn-SOD 
against low temperature, extreme acidity and alkalinity, chemicals, proteases, 
and high pressure make it a potential candidate in biopharmaceutical and 
nutraceutical fields.
