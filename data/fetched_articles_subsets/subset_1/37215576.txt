DNA methylation is the most stable epigenetic modification. In mammals, it 
usually occurs at the cytosine of CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is 
essential for many physiological and pathological processes. Aberrant DNA 
methylation has been observed in human diseases, particularly cancer. Notably, 
conventional DNA methylation profiling technologies require a large amount of 
DNA, often from a heterogeneous cell population, and provide an average 
methylation level of many cells. It is often not realistic to collect sufficient 
numbers of cells, such as rare cells and circulating tumor cells in peripheral 
blood, for bulk sequencing assays. It is therefore essential to develop 
sequencing technologies that can accurately profile DNA methylation using small 
numbers of cells or even single cells. Excitingly, many single-cell DNA 
methylation sequencing and single-cell omics sequencing technologies have been 
developed, and applications of these methods have greatly expanded our 
understanding of the molecular mechanism of DNA methylation. Here, we summaries 
single-cell DNA methylation and multi-omics sequencing methods, delineate their 
applications in biomedical sciences, discuss technical challenges, and present 
our perspective on future research directions.
