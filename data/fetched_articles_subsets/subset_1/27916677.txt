BACKGROUND: Copper is an essential trace element required for the proper 
functioning of various enzymes present in the central nervous system. An 
imbalance in the copper homeostasis results in the pathology of various 
neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease. Hence, residue 
specific interaction of Cu2+ to α-Syn along with the familial mutants H50Q and 
G51D needs to be studied in detail.
METHODS: We investigated the residue specific mapping of Cu2+ binding sites and 
binding strength using solution-state NMR and ITC respectively. The aggregation 
kinetics, secondary structural changes, and morphology of the formed fibrils in 
the presence and absence of Cu2+ were studied using fluorescence, CD, and AFM 
respectively.
RESULTS: Copper binding to α-Syn takes place at three different sites with a 
higher affinity for the region 48-53. While one of the sites got abolished in 
the case of H50Q, the mutant G51D showed a binding pattern similar to WT. The 
aggregation kinetics of these proteins in the presence of Cu2+ showed an 
enhanced rate of fibril formation with a pronounced effect for G51D.
CONCLUSION: Cu2+ binding results in the destabilization of long-range tertiary 
interactions in α-Syn leading to the exposure of highly amyloidogenic NAC region 
which results in the increased rate of fibril formation. Although the residues 
48-53 have a stronger affinity for Cu2+ in case of WT and G51D, the binding is 
not responsible for enhancing the rate of fibril formation in case of H50Q.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings will help in the better understanding of 
Cu2+ catalyzed aggregation of synucleins.
