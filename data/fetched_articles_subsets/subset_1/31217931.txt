OBJECTIVES: Gallic acid (GA), a potent anti-oxidant, plays an important role in 
reducing diabetic induced cardiac disorders. Therefore, the present 
investigation was purposed to determine the beneficial effect of GA in cardiac 
arrhythmias during reperfusion in diabetes induced by alloxan.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were randomly 
divided into three groups (eight in each group): control (C), diabetic (D), and 
diabetic treated with GA (D+G) groups. GA was administered by gavage (25 mg/kg, 
daily) for eight weeks. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal 
injection of alloxan (120 mg/kg). Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury was performed 
by ischemia and then reperfusion (30 and 120 min, respectively). The score and 
magnitude of arrhythmias, creatine kinase (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) of the heart, electrocardiographic, and hemodynamic parameters were 
measured. One-way ANOVA followed by LSD tests were used for the differences 
between groups. The percentage of incidence was also evaluated by Fisher's exact 
test.
RESULTS: The duration (P<0.05), onset (P<0.01), score and incidence of 
arrhythmia, QT interval (P<0.001), LDH, and CK-MB (P<0.05) were significantly 
elevated and the contractility of the heart (Â±dp/dt, P<0.01), LVSP, QRS complex 
voltage (P<0.05), and heart rate (P<0.01) were significantly reduced in the 
diabetic animals compared with the control rats. However, administration with GA 
significantly improved these alterations in the diabetic group compared with the 
diabetic animals.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated the beneficial effects of GA on cardiac 
electrophysiology and arrhythmias during reperfusion in diabetes.
