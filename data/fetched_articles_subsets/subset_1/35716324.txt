BACKGROUND: Additional histologic features of T3 colon cancer, such as tumour 
depth invasion beyond muscularis propria and elastic lamina invasion (ELI), have 
taken interest for a more accurate staging.
METHODS: Patients with pT3 and pT4a (control group) colon adenocarcinoma were 
retrospectively collected from our institutional database. The study group was 
divided according to depth of tumour invasion < 5 mm and ≥ 5 mm, and into 
ELI - and ELI + . Chi-square test was used to compare the clinicopathological 
characteristics. OS and DFS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and 
compared with the log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional 
hazard models were employed to assess the effect on OS and DFS.
RESULTS: Out of 290 pT3 tumours, 168 (58%) had a depth of tumour invasion < 5 mm 
and 122 (42%) ≥ 5 mm. The 5-year OS and DFS were 85.2, 68.7 and 60.9%, and 81.4, 
73.9 and 60.1% in pT3 < 5 mm, pT3 ≥ 5 mm, and pT4a respectively (p = 0.001, 
p = 0.072). Considering ELI - (n = 157, 54%) and ELI + (n = 133, 46%), the 
5-year OS and DFS were 78.9, 76.7, and 60.9%, and 75.5, 81.5, and 60.1% in ELI  
- , ELI + and pT4a respectively (p = 0.955, p = 0.462). At multivariable 
analysis, the depth of invasion was found to be an independent predictive factor 
for OS (HR 2.04, 95%CI 1.28-3.24, p = 0.003) and DFS (HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.24-3.18, 
p = 0.004), while ELI did not result a prognostic factor for OS nor DFS.
CONCLUSION: In pT3 colon cancer, depth of tumour invasion ≥ 5 mm is an 
independent risk factor for OS and DFS, whereas ELI did not result a prognostic 
factor affecting OS nor DFS.
