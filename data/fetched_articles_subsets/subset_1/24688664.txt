Corynebacterium glutamicum is well known as the amino acid-producing workhorse 
of fermentation industry, being used for multi-million-ton scale production of 
glutamate and lysine for more than 60 years. However, it is only recently that 
extensive research has focused on engineering it beyond the scope of amino 
acids. Meanwhile, a variety of corynebacterial strains allows access to 
alternative carbon sources and/or allows production of a wide range of 
industrially relevant compounds. Some of these efforts set new standards in 
terms of titers and productivities achieved whereas others represent a 
proof-of-principle. These achievements manifest the position of C. glutamicum as 
an important industrial microorganism with capabilities far beyond the 
traditional amino acid production. In this review we focus on the state of the 
art of metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum for utilization of alternative 
carbon sources, (e.g. coming from wastes and unprocessed sources), and 
construction of C. glutamicum strains for production of new products such as 
diamines, organic acids and alcohols.
