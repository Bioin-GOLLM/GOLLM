Although a group of FDA-approved drugs were previously identified with activity 
against Ebola virus (EBOV), most of them are not clinically useful because their 
human blood concentrations are not high enough to inhibit EBOV infection. We 
screened 795 unique three-drug combinations in an EBOV entry assay. Two sets of 
three-drug combinations, toremifene-mefloquine-posaconazole and 
toremifene-clarithromycin-posaconazole, were identified that effectively blocked 
EBOV entry and were further validated for inhibition of live EBOV infection. The 
individual drug concentrations in the combinations were reduced to clinically 
relevant levels. We identified mechanisms of action of these drugs: functional 
inhibitions of Niemann-Pick C1, acid sphingomyelinase, and lysosomal calcium 
release. Our findings identify the drug combinations with potential to treat 
EBOV infection.
