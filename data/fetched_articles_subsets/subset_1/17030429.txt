The adenosine A2A receptor has emerged as an attractive non-dopaminergic target 
in the pursuit of improved therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), based in part 
on its unique CNS distribution. It is highly enriched in striatopallidal neurons 
and can form functional heteromeric complexes with other G-protein-coupled 
receptors, including dopamine D2, metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 and adenosine A1 
receptors. Blockade of the adenosine A2A receptor in striatopallidal neurons 
reduces postsynaptic effects of dopamine depletion, and in turn lessens the 
motor deficits of PD. A2A antagonists might partially improve not only the 
symptoms of PD but also its course, by slowing the underlying neurodegeneration 
and reducing the maladaptive neuroplasticity that complicates standard 'dopamine 
replacement' treatments. Thus, we review here a prime example of translational 
neuroscience, through which antagonism of A2A receptors has now entered the 
arena of clinical trials with realistic prospects for advancing PD therapeutics.
