OBJECTIVES: Hypotonia, lethargy, eczema, alopecia, conjunctivitis, ataxia, 
hearing loss, optic atrophy, cognitive retardation, and seizures can occur in 
patients with biotinidase deficiency, and it is inherited as autosomal 
recessive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cases followed up with the 
diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency in our unit, in terms of clinical, 
biochemical and genetic analyses.
METHODS: A total of 112 cases followed up in our centre with the diagnosis of 
biotinidase deficiency between August 2018-September 2020 were included in the 
study. Data were collected retrospectively.
RESULTS: A total of 112 cases (55.4% male, mean age: 2.2 ± 2.8 years) diagnosed 
with biotinidase deficiency were evaluated. Diagnoses were made by newborn 
screening in 90.2% of the cases, by family screening in 4.5%, and by 
investigating symptoms in 5.4%. The most frequently (27.5%) detected mutations 
were c.1330G>C (p.D444H)/c.1330G>C (p.D444H) homozygous mutation, followed by 
(13.0%) c.1330G>C (p.D444H)/c.470G>A (p.R157H) compound heterozygous mutation, 
and (13.0%) c.470G>A (p.R157H)/c.470G>A (p.R157H) homozygous mutation. 
Biotinidase enzyme levels were found to be higher in patients with the p.D444H 
homozygous mutation than patients with other mutations. Biotin treatment was 
started in all patients with enzyme deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Since the treatment is inexpensive and easily available, it is 
vital to detect this disease before symptom onset, especially findings related 
to the central nervous system, hearing and vision loss. In patients diagnosed 
with enzyme deficiency, the diagnosis should be definitively confirmed by 
genetic analysis.
