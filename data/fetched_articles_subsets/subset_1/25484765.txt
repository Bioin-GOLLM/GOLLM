The title mol-ecule, [Ir(C14H14FN2O)2(C5H7O2)], is located on a twofold rotation 
axis, which passes through the Ir(III) atom and the central C atom of the 
pentane-2,4-dionate anion. The Ir(III) atom adopts a distorted octa-hedral 
coordination geometry, being C,N-chelated by two 
2-tert-but-oxy-6-fluoro-3-(pyridin-2-yl)pyridin-4-yl ligands and O,O'-chelated 
by the pentane-2,4-dionato ligand. The bipyridinate ligands, which are 
perpendicular to each other [dihedral angle between the two least-squares planes 
= 89.95 (5)°], are arranged in a cis-C,C' and trans-N,N' fashion relative to the 
central metal cation. Intra-molecular C-H⋯O and C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds and 
inter-molecular C-H⋯F hydrogen bonds as well as π-π inter-actions between 
neighbouring pyridine rings [centroid-centroid distance 3.680 (1) Å] contribute 
to the stabilization of the mol-ecular and crystal structure, respectively.
