The prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens significantly limited the 
number of effective antibiotics available clinically, which urgently requires 
new drug targets to screen, design, and develop novel antibacterial drugs. 
Two-component system (TCS), which is comprised of a histidine kinase (HK) and a 
response regulator (RR), is a common mechanism whereby bacteria can sense a 
range of stimuli and make an appropriate adaptive response. HKs as the sensor 
part of the bacterial TCS can regulate various processes such as growth, 
vitality, antibiotic resistance, and virulence, and have been considered as a 
promising target for antibacterial drugs. In the current review, we highlighted 
the structural basis and functional importance of bacterial TCS especially HKs 
as a target in the discovery of new antimicrobials, and summarize the latest 
research progress of small-molecule HK-inhibitors as potential novel 
antimicrobial drugs reported in the past decade.
