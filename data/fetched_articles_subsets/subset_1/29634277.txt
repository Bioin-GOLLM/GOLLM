Polylysine is a Proteostasis Network-Engaging Structural Determinant.

Lang WH, Calloni G, Vabulas RM.

C-terminal polylysine (PL) can be synthesized from the polyadenine tail of 
prematurely cleaved mRNAs or when a read-though of a stop codon happens. Due to 
the highly positive charge, PL stalls in the electrostatically negative 
ribosomal exit channel. The stalled polypeptide recruits the Ribosome-associated 
quality control (RQC) complex which processes and extracts the nascent chain. 
Dysfunction of the RQC leads to the accumulation of PL-tagged proteins, 
induction of a stress response, and cellular toxicity. Not much is known about 
the PL-specific aspect of protein quality control. Using quantitative mass 
spectrometry, we uncovered the post-ribosomal PL-processing machinery in human 
cytosol. It encompasses key cytosolic complexes of the proteostasis network, 
such as chaperonin TCP-1 ring complexes (TRiC) and half-capped 19S-20S 
proteasomes. Furthermore, we found that the nuclear transport machinery 
associates with PL, which suggests a novel mechanism by which faulty proteins 
can be compartmentalized in the cell. The enhanced nuclear import of a PL-tagged 
polypeptide confirmed this implication, which leads to questions regarding the 
biological rationale behind it.
