Metacaspases (MCAs) are cysteine peptidases expressed in plants, fungi and 
protozoa, with a caspase-like histidine-cysteine catalytic dyad, but differing 
from caspases, for example, in their substrate specificity. The role of MCAs is 
subject to debate: roles in cell cycle control, in cell death or even in cell 
survival have been suggested. In this study, using a Leishmania major 
MCA-deficient strain, we showed that L. major MCA (LmjMCA) not only had a role 
similar to caspases in cell death but also in autophagy and this through 
different domains. Upon cell death induction by miltefosine or H2O2, LmjMCA is 
processed, releasing the catalytic domain, which activated substrates via its 
catalytic dyad His/Cys and a proline-rich C-terminal domain. The C-terminal 
domain interacted with proteins, notably proteins involved in stress regulation, 
such as the MAP kinase LmaMPK7 or programmed cell death like the calpain-like 
cysteine peptidase. We also showed a new role of LmjMCA in autophagy, acting on 
or upstream of ATG8, involving Lmjmca gene overexpression and interaction of the 
C-terminal domain of LmjMCA with itself and other proteins. These results 
allowed us to propose two models, showing the role of LmjMCA in the cell death 
and also in the autophagy pathway, implicating different protein domains.
