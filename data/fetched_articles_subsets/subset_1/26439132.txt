BACKGROUND: The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to ovarian cancer in Japanese 
patients is still unclear. This study investigated the frequency of germline 
mutations in BRCA1/2 in Japanese patients with ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian 
tube cancer, regardless of their family histories, which were suggestive of 
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Ninety-five unselected women with ovarian cancer who were seen from 
2013 to 2015 at Yamanashi Prefectural Central Hospital were enrolled. Analyses 
of BRCA1/2 gene mutations were performed with next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: Twelve of the 95 patients (12.6%), including 5 in the BRCA1 (5.3%) and 
7 in the BRCA2 (7.4%), had deleterious mutations. Among the 36 cases with a 
family history, 6 (16.7%) were found to carry mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. 
Notably, 6 of the 59 cases (10.2%) without a family history also had BRCA1/2 
germline mutations. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P 
= .36). The presence of mutations and their clinical relevance were studied. 
Mutation carriers were diagnosed at advanced stages (100% of positive cases 
among stage III or IV cases) and had poor prognostic histological subtypes (100% 
of positive cases had high-grade serous adenocarcinomas).
CONCLUSIONS: In this unselected Japanese population, approximately 13% of the 
cases with ovarian cancer appeared to be associated with an inherited risk, 
regardless of a family history. This finding indicates that BRCA1/2 genetic 
testing should be performed for all patients with ovarian cancers.
