BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumour initiation, 
metastasis and recurrence. However, the mechanism of CSC formation, maintenance 
and expansion in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly characterised.
METHODS: The role of COP9 signalosome subunit 6 (CSN6) in regulating cancer 
stemness was evaluated by organoid formation and limited dilution analysis. The 
role of CSN6-TRIM21-OCT1-ALDH1A1 axis in CSC formation was evaluated in vitro 
and in vivo. The association of CSN6, TRIM21 and ALDH1A1 expression was 
validated by a tissue microarray with 267 CRC patients.
RESULTS: The results showed that CSN6 is critical for sphere formation and 
maintaining the growth of patient-derived organoids (PDOs). We characterised the 
role of CSN6 in regulating cancer stemness, which involves the TRIM21 E3 
ubiquitin ligase, transcription factor POU class 2 homeobox 1 (OCT1) and cancer 
stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 A1 (ALDH1A1). Our data showed that 
CSN6 facilitates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of TRIM21, which in turn 
decreases TRIM21-mediated OCT1 ubiquitination and subsequently stabilises OCT1. 
Consequently, OCT1 stabilisation leads to ALDH1A1expression and promotes cancer 
stemness. We further showed that the protein expression levels of CSN6, TRIM21 
and ALDH1A1 can serve as prognostic markers for human CRC.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we validate a pathway for cancer stemness regulation 
involving ALDH1A1 levels through the CSN6-TRIM21 axis, which may be utilised as 
CRC molecular markers and be targeted for therapeutic intervention in cancers.
