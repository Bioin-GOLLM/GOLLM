Spinach is a nutritious leafy vegetable belonging to the family Chenopodiaceae. 
Here we report a high-quality chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of 
spinach and genome resequencing of 305 cultivated and wild spinach accessions. 
Reconstruction of ancestral Chenopodiaceae karyotype indicates substantial 
genome rearrangements in spinach after its divergence from ancestral 
Chenopodiaceae, coinciding with high repeat content in the spinach genome. 
Population genomic analyses provide insights into spinach genetic diversity and 
population differentiation. Genome-wide association studies of 20 agronomical 
traits identify numerous significantly associated regions and candidate genes 
for these traits. Domestication sweeps in the spinach genome are identified, 
some of which are associated with important traits (e.g., leaf phenotype, 
bolting and flowering), demonstrating the role of artificial selection in 
shaping spinach phenotypic evolution. This study provides not only insights into 
the spinach evolution and domestication but also valuable resources for 
facilitating spinach breeding.
