The prediction of high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) toxicity is a key issue in the 
individualization of treatment in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
Our aim was to evaluate the influence of MTX pathway polymorphisms on HD-MTX 
treatment outcome in children with ALL. In total, 167 children with ALL were 
genotyped for methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD1) 1958G > A, 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C > T and 1298A > C and 
thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 2R > 3R polymorphisms. The MTHFD1 1958A allele 
significantly reduced the odds of hepatotoxicity (adjusted p = 0.009), while the 
TYMS 3R allele significantly reduced the odds of leukocytopenia and 
thrombocytopenia (adjusted p = 0.005 and adjusted p = 0.002, respectively). 
MTHFR polymorphisms did not influence HD-MTX-related toxicity, but a significant 
effect of MTHFR 677C > T-TYMS 2R > 3R and MTHFD1 1958G > A-MTHFR 677C > T 
interactions on HD-MTX-related toxicity was observed. None of the investigated 
polymorphisms influenced survival. Our study suggests an important role of 
polymorphisms and gene-gene interactions within the folate pathway in 
HD-MTX-related toxicity in childhood ALL.
