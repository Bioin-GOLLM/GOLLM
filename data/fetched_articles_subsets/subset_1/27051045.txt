An association between polymorphisms in the sodium taurocholate cotransporting 
polypeptide (NTCP) and the natural course of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 
in the Chinese Han population has been noted. However, it is not known whether 
these polymorphisms are associated with the risk of developing chronic HBV 
infection in other racial or ethnic populations. Accordingly, we conducted a 
candidate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study in Tibetan and 
Uygur HBV-infected patients. A total of 1302 subjects including 871 Tibetans and 
431 Uygurs were recruited. According to their serological and clinical 
characteristics, each ethnic group was divided into two groups comprising 
spontaneous clearance individuals and persistently infected patients. Three SNPs 
were genotyped by a high resolution melting curve methodology. Among the SNPs, 
rs2296651 exhibited a minor allele frequency of <0.01. The frequency of allele A 
at rs4646287 was much higher in Tibetans (9.4% for Tibetans and 4.6% for Uygurs, 
p<0.001) than in Uygurs, but the frequency of allele A at rs7154439 was the 
opposite (15.7% for Tibetans and 20.5% for Uygurs, p=0.002). Irrespective of 
race, no significant differences in the frequency distributions of the three SNP 
alleles or genotypes were observed between the case and clearance groups. 
Moreover, none of the NTCP haplotypes were statistically different between the 
two groups. Data from the Tibetan patients could be grouped by HBeAg status, 
viral load and HBV genotype; however, no significant differences were found in 
the SNP genotype distribution for each characteristic. In conclusion, the NTCP 
polymorphisms we identified tended to be ethnicity-dependent. For Tibetans and 
Uygurs, no association of the three SNPs (rs7154439, rs4646287 and rs2296651) 
and their haplotypes with HBV chronicity was observed. Examination of SNPs in 
NTCP for their specific associations with the course of HBV infection in other 
ethnic minority groups is now required.
