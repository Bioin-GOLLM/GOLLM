bleeding phenotype - is this mild haemophilia A?

Patients with mild haemophilia A may have a discrepancy in the factor VIII 
(FVIII) level when measured with a one-stage assay (FVIII:C1) compared with a 
two-stage assay (FVIII:C2). This discrepancy usually results in the one-stage 
level being higher than the two-stage level. A F8 mutation resulting in a 
Tyr346-->Cys substitution within the a1 interdomain region has been described 
which results in the converse assay discrepancy. We report four individuals 
(three families) who have this mutation. Mean FVIII:C1 level was 25 IU dL(-1) 
compared with a mean FVIII:C2 level of 63 IU dL(-1). These individuals had 
presented opportunistically and did not have a clinically significant bleeding 
disorder. The bleeding phenotype correlated with the two-stage assay result 
rather than the one-stage result. FVIII replacement therapy does not appear to 
be required for these individuals.
