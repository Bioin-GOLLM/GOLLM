Disruption of fast axonal transport (FAT) is an early pathological event in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble amyloid-β oligomers (AβOs), increasingly 
recognized as proximal neurotoxins in AD, impair organelle transport in cultured 
neurons and transgenic mouse models. AβOs also stimulate hyperphosphorylation of 
the axonal microtubule-associated protein, tau. However, the role of tau in FAT 
disruption is controversial. Here we show that AβOs reduce vesicular transport 
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal neurons from both 
wild-type and tau-knockout mice, indicating that tau is not required for 
transport disruption. FAT inhibition is not accompanied by microtubule 
destabilization or neuronal death. Significantly, inhibition of calcineurin 
(CaN), a calcium-dependent phosphatase implicated in AD pathogenesis, rescues 
BDNF transport. Moreover, inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and glycogen 
synthase kinase 3β, downstream targets of CaN, prevents BDNF transport defects 
induced by AβOs. We further show that AβOs induce CaN activation through 
nonexcitotoxic calcium signaling. Results implicate CaN in FAT regulation and 
demonstrate that tau is not required for AβO-induced BDNF transport disruption.
