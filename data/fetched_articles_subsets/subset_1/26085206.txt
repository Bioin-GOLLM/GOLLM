The signaling adapter protein tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated 
factor 3 (TRAF3) is both modified by and contributes to several types of 
ubiquitination events. TRAF3 plays a variety of context-dependent regulatory 
roles in all types of immune cells. In B lymphocytes, TRAF3 contributes to 
regulation of signaling by members of both the TNFR superfamily and innate 
immune receptors. TRAF3 also plays a unique cell type-specific and critical role 
in the restraint of B-cell homeostatic survival, a role with important 
implications for both B-cell differentiation and the pathogenesis of B-cell 
malignancies. This review focuses upon the relationship between ubiquitin and 
TRAF3, and how this contributes to multiple functions of TRAF3 in the regulation 
of signal transduction, transcriptional activation, and effector functions of B 
lymphocytes.
