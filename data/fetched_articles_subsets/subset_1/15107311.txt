BACKGROUND: Despite the efficacy of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
Imatinib mesylate for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 
resistance has been observed in a proportion of cases, especially those with 
advanced stages of the disease. Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain are 
emerging as the most frequent mechanism for reactivation of kinase activity 
within the leukemic clone.
METHODS: We developed a denaturing-HPLC (D-HPLC)-based assay for screening for 
ABL point mutations. For each sample, two partially overlapping fragments of 393 
and 482 bp corresponding to the kinase domain were amplified by nested reverse 
transcription-PCR and analyzed under selected temperature and acetonitrile 
gradient conditions. Fifty-one bone marrow and/or peripheral blood specimens 
from 27 CML patients who showed cytogenetic resistance to Imatinib were screened 
in parallel by D-HPLC and by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: In 12 of 27 (44%) patients, D-HPLC showed an abnormal elution profile 
suggesting the presence of a nucleotide change. Direct sequencing confirmed the 
presence of a point mutation in all cases. Conversely, all samples scored as 
wild type by D-HPLC showed no evidence of mutations by direct sequencing. In two 
cases, novel amino acid substitutions at codons already known for being 
hot-spots of mutation were identified (F311I and E355D).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed D-HPLC-based assay is highly specific and at least as 
sensitive as sequencing; with respect to the latter, it provides a much faster 
and less expensive semiautomated system for mutational screening. It may 
therefore potentially be a valuable tool for regular, large-scale testing of 
patients undergoing Imatinib treatment.
