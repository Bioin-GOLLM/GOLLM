Mutagenesis directed to a specific glycosylation site has been widely used to 
examine biological roles of individual glycans. However, occurrence of any 
post-translational modification on such deglycosylated mutants has not yet been 
well characterized. Here we performed mass spectrometric analyses of the Fc 
fragment of an unglycosylated mutant of mouse immunoglobulin G2b, whose 
conserved N-glycosylation site, i.e. Asn297, was substituted with alanine. We 
found that a major part of this mutant is sulfated at Tyr296, which adjacently 
precedes the originally glycosylated site. Our findings demonstrate that 
mutational deglycosylation can induce an unexpected post-translational 
modification in the protein.
