In the title compound, C(20)H(16)F(2)O(2), the cyclo-hex-2-en-1-one ring adopts 
a distorted envelope conformation and the dihedral angles between its six-atom 
mean plane and the fluorophenyl rings are 38.9(8) and 82.3(1)°. The two 
fluoro-phenyl rings are oriented at an angle of 77.3 (3)°. The long hy-droxy O-H 
bond length of 1.22 (3) and the H⋯O distance of 1.28 (3) Å, together with a 
longer than expected C=O bond length [1.290 (2) Å] in the hy-droxy(en-1-one) 
group, indicate sharing of the H atom as O⋯H⋯O between the two O atoms and the 
influence of electron delocalization. Weak C-H⋯O inter-molecular inter-actions 
form an infinite two-dimensional network in (011).
