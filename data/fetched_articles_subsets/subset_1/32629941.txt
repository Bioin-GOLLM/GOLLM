Fresnel micro-structured lenses are widely used in the field of modern 
optoelectronic technology. High-precision Fresnel micro-structured mold is the 
key technology to achieve its large-scale replication production. Focusing on 
the surface waviness error of Fresnel micro-structured mold machined by parallel 
grinding process, this paper conducted theoretical modeling and experiment 
research. Based on the grinding kinematics theory, the simulation models of the 
surface waviness topography and the circular waviness profiles of the ground 
Fresnel micro-structured mold were developed, considering the combined influence 
of the non-integer rotation speed ratio and other grinding parameters. A series 
of grinding experiments were carried out to verify the proposed simulation 
models. The influence of a non-integer rotation speed ratio and a wave-shift 
value upon the surface waviness error of the ground Fresnel micro-structured 
molds were analyzed. Both the simulation and experimental results proved that 
choosing the non-integer rotation speed ratio and a proper wave-shift value 
could greatly reduce the surface waviness error and improve the surface quality 
and uniformity.
