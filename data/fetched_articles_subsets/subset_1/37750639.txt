OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus (DM)-mediated impaired glucose metabolism increase 
in the glioblastoma (GB) risk by inducing hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. An 
integral membrane transport protein, glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) facilitates 
glucose transport into GB tumor cells. We aimed to explore the regulation of 
GLUT3 in GB tumors of patients who were concurrently diagnosed with DM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples were 
collected from 93 GB patients and retrospectively analyzed. Of the total, 15 
patients were concurrently diagnosed with DM (GB-DM). The role of GLUT3 in tumor 
aggressiveness was evaluated by analyzing its correlation with Ki67, P53 
expression, MALAT1 expression, and peripheral blood hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) 
level. T98G cells were treated with empagliflozin and metformin to modulate 
GLUT3. The RNA expression of GLUT3, SOX2, and MALAT1 was analyzed by real-time 
qPCR. The lactate levels of T98G cells were measured by Cobas c502 analyzer. A 
scratch wound assay was performed to investigate the migration rate of T98G 
cells.
RESULTS: GLUT3 expression was lower in GB-DM tumors than in GB-only tumors. In 
GB-DM, the expression of tumoral GLUT3 and peripheral blood glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) levels were negatively correlated with P53 and Ki67. A decreased GLUT3 
shortened the disease-free survival duration in GB-DM patients. Empagliflozin 
reduced GLUT3, while metformin-induced GLUT3 in T98G cells. The 
empagliflozin-mediated GLUT3 suppression induced SOX2 and MALAT1 expressions and 
influenced the migration capacity of T98G cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the low GLUT3 expression of the tumors of 
GB-DM patients may induce the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from 
cellular energy sources other than glucose metabolism. However, further studies 
are warranted to confirm these results.
