BACKGROUND: Circulating levels of cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, a tumor marker and 
regulator of cellular metabolism, were reduced by metformin in a nonrandomized 
neoadjuvant study. We examined the effects of metformin (vs placebo) on CA 15-3 
in participants of MA.32, a phase III randomized trial in early-stage breast 
cancer.
METHODS: A total of 3649 patients with T1-3, N0-3, M0 breast cancer were 
randomly assigned; pretreatment and 6-month on-treatment fasting plasma were 
centrally assayed for CA 15-3. Genomic DNA was analyzed for the rs11212617 
single nucleotide polymorphism. Absolute and relative change of CA 15-3 
(metformin vs placebo) were compared using Wilcoxon rank and t tests. Regression 
models adjusted for baseline differences and assessed key interactions. All 
statistical tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 52.4 (10.0) years. The majority of patients had T2/3, 
node-positive, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer treated 
with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Mean (SD) baseline CA 15-3 
was 17.7 (7.6) and 18.0 (8.1 U/mL). At 6 months, CA 15-3 was statistically 
significantly reduced in metformin vs placebo arms (absolute geometric mean 
reduction in CA 15-3 = 7.7% vs 2.0%, P < .001; relative metformin: placebo level 
of CA 15-3 [adjusted for age, baseline body mass index, and baseline CA 15-3] = 
0.94, 95% confidence interval = 0.92 to 0.96). This reduction was independent of 
tumor characteristics, perioperative systemic therapy, baseline body mass index, 
insulin, and the single nucleotide polymorphism status (all Ps > .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Our observation that metformin reduces CA 15-3 by approximately 6% 
was corroborated in a large placebo-controlled randomized trial. The clinical 
implications of this reduction in CA 15-3 will be explored in upcoming efficacy 
analyses of breast cancer outcomes in MA.32.
