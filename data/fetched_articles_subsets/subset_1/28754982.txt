Non-typhoidal Salmonella are associated with gastrointestinal disease worldwide 
and invasive disease in Africa. We constructed novel bivalent vaccines through 
the recombinant expression of heterologous O-antigens from Salmonella 
Choleraesuis in Salmonella Typhimurium. A recombinant Asd+ plasmid pCZ1 with the 
cloned Salmonella Choleraesuis O-antigen gene cluster was introduced into three 
constructed Salmonella Typhimurium Δasd mutants: SLT11 (ΔrfbP), SLT12 
(ΔrmlB-rfbP) and SLT16 (ΔrfbP ∆pagL::TT araCPBAD rfbP). Immunoblotting 
demonstrated that SLT11 (pCZ1) and SLT12 (pCZ1) efficiently expressed the 
heterologous O-antigen. In the presence of arabinose, SLT16 (pCZ1) expressed 
both the homologous and heterologous O-antigens, whereas in the absence of 
arabinose, SLT16 (pCZ1) mainly expressed the heterologous O-antigen. We deleted 
the crp/cya genes in SLT12 (pCZ1) and SLT16 (pCZ1) for attenuation purposes, 
generating the recombinant vaccine strains SLT17 (pCZ1) and SLT18 (pCZ1). 
Immunization with either SLT17 (pCZ1) or SLT18 (pCZ1) induced specific IgG 
against the heterologous O-antigen, which mediated significant killing of 
Salmonella Choleraesuis and provided full protection against a lethal homologous 
challenge in mice. Furthermore, SLT17 (pCZ1) or SLT18 (pCZ1) immunization 
resulted in 83% or 50% heterologous protection against Salmonella Choleraesuis 
challenge, respectively. Our study demonstrates that heterologous O-antigen 
expression is a promising strategy for the development of multivalent Salmonella 
vaccines.
