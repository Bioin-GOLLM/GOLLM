The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence and prognostic value of 
myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) L265P in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). We assessed the MYD88 L265P mutation using 
an allele-specific semi-nested polymerase chain reaction method in 53 DLBCL 
patients treated with R-CHOP. The MYD88 L265P mutation was detected in 16 of 53 
DLBCL (30.19%) samples from patients treated with R-CHOP. Age and location were 
statistically significantly associated with MYD88 L265P (P=0.025, 0.033, 
respectively), while treatment response and tumor recurrence were not. 
Univariate analysis showed that B symptoms (P=0.004) and Ki-67 (P=0.03) were 
significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS), while MYD88 L265P 
showed no significant association with overall survival and PFS. Multivariate 
analysis showed that B symptoms were significantly associated with PFS. Our 
study suggests that the prognostic value of MYD88 L265P in DLBCL patients with 
R-CHOP requires further research.
