Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Its high mortality is 
associated with high metastatic potential. Here, we show that the RAC1-selective 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor T cell invasion and metastasis-inducing 
protein 1 (TIAM1) promotes cell migration and invasion in the most common 
subtype of lung cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), through an 
unexpected nuclear function. We show that TIAM1 interacts with TRIM28, a master 
regulator of gene expression, in the nucleus of NSCLC cells. We reveal that a 
TIAM1-TRIM28 complex promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a phenotypic 
switch implicated in cell migration and invasion. This occurs through 
H3K9me3-induced silencing of protocadherins and by decreasing E-cadherin 
expression, thereby antagonizing cell-cell adhesion. Consistently, TIAM1 or 
TRIM28 depletion suppresses the migration of NSCLC cells, while migration is 
restored by the simultaneous depletion of protocadherins. Importantly, high 
nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens is associated with advanced-stage lung 
adenocarcinoma, decreased patient survival, and inversely correlates with 
E-cadherin expression.
