Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is responsible for 
significant disease burden worldwide. Current evidence has suggested that 
systemic inflammatory response plays a crucial role in the initiation, 
maintenance, and progression of AF. So, recent efforts have been directed in 
search of measurable inflammatory biomarkers as additional tools in severity and 
prognosis assessment of AF. A simple, and easily obtainable, inflammatory marker 
is the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which has shown good performance in 
preliminary studies as a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with AF. In 
this work, we performed a thorough review of clinical studies that evaluated the 
role of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and NLR as predictors of 
outcomes in AF. We gave a particular emphasis on the NLR because it is a 
simpler, widely available, and inexpensive biomarker.
