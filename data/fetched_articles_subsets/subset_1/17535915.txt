Nucleophosmin/B23 is a major multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein that plays 
a critical role in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. Arf tumor 
suppressor binds B23 and enhances its sumoylation. However, the biological 
effects of this event remain unknown. Here we show that B23 is sumoylated on 
both Lysine 230 and 263 residues, but the latter is the major one. Mutation of 
K263, but not K230, into R abolishes its centrosomal and nucleolar residency. 
Moreover, Rb binds to wild-type B23, but fails to interact with K263R. 
Sumoylation enhances B23 binding to Rb. Consequently, B23 potently stimulates 
E2F1-mediated transcriptional activity, which is abolished in B23 K263R. 
Further, K263R mutation makes B23 vulnerable to caspase-3 cleavage and 
sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Surprisingly, K230R mutant strongly binds to 
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate and suppresses DNA fragmentation. Thus, 
B23 sumoylation regulates its subcellular localization, cell proliferation, and 
survival activities.
