The mechanism of arsenic-induced skin carcinogenesis is not yet fully 
understood. Chromosomal instability contributes to aneuploidy and is a driving 
force in carcinogenesis. Arsenic causes mitotic arrest and induces aneuploidy. 
hsa-miR-186 overexpression is associated with metastatic cancers as well as 
arsenic-induced squamous cell carcinoma and is reported to target several 
mitotic regulators. Decreased levels of these proteins can dysregulate chromatid 
segregation contributing to aneuploidy. This work investigates the potential 
aneuploidogenic role of hsa-miR-186 in arsenic carcinogenesis. Clones of 
immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) stably transfected with a hsa-miR-186 
expression or empty vector were isolated. Three clones with high and low 
hsa-miR-186 expression determined by RT-qPCR were selected for further analysis 
and cultured with 0 or 100 nM NaAsO2 for 8 weeks. Analysis of mitoses revealed 
that chromosome number and structural abnormalities increased in cells 
overexpressing hsa-miR-186 and were further increased by arsenite exposure. 
Double minutes were the dominant structural aberrations. The peak number of 
chromosomes also increased. Cells with >220 to >270 chromosomes appeared after 
2 months in hsa-miR-186 overexpressing cells, indicating multiple rounds of 
endomitosis had occurred. The fraction of cells with increased chromosome number 
or structural abnormalities did not increase in passage matched control cells. 
Levels of selected target proteins were determined by western blot. Expression 
of BUB1, a predicted hsa-miR-186 target was suppressed in hsa-miR-186 
overexpressing clones, but increased with arsenite exposure. CDC27 remained 
constant under all conditions. These results suggest that overexpression of 
miR-186 in arsenic exposed tissues likely induces aneuploidy contributing to 
arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.
