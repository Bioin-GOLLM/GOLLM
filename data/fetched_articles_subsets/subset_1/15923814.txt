OBJECTIVE: Data on the association of the ACE I/D and AT1R A1166C polymorphisms 
with hypertension are conflicting. Most studies, however, have focused on office 
blood pressure (BP) only. The objective of the present study was to investigate 
the association of BP with the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion 
(ACE I/D) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor A1166C (AT1R A1166C) polymorphisms 
by means of both office and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 348 hypertensive patients participated in this 
study. Office BP did not differ between the various ACE or AT1R genotype groups. 
However, ambulatory BP and BP load were positively associated with the ACE I/D 
polymorphism. This was more apparent in men than in women. There were no 
differences in heart rate, BP variability, and amount of dipping. The AT1R 
A1166C polymorphism showed no consistent association with blood pressure (load).
CONCLUSION: From these data we conclude that frequent measuring of blood 
pressure by ABPM is crucial to find an association of the ACE D allele with 
various aspects of blood pressure.
