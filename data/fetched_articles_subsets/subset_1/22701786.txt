Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive DNA instability disorder associated with 
developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to 
cancer. Based on their sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, FA cells have 
been assigned to 15 complementation groups, and the associated genes have been 
identified. Founder mutations have been found in different FA genes in several 
populations. The majority of Dutch FA patients belongs to complementation group 
FA-C. Here, we report 15 patients of Dutch ancestry and a large Canadian 
Manitoba Mennonite kindred carrying the FANCC c.67delG mutation. Genealogical 
investigation into the ancestors of the Dutch patients shows that these 
ancestors lived in four distinct areas in The Netherlands. We also show that the 
Dutch and Manitoba Mennonite FANCC c.67delG patients share the same haplotype 
surrounding this mutation, indicating a common founder.
