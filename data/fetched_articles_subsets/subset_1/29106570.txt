The UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu) provides a web interface for 
exploring annotated genome assemblies. The assemblies and annotation tracks are 
updated on an ongoing basis-12 assemblies and more than 28 tracks were added in 
the past year. Two recent additions are a display of CRISPR/Cas9 guide sequences 
and an interactive navigator for gene interactions. Other upgrades from the past 
year include a command-line version of the Variant Annotation Integrator, 
support for Human Genome Variation Society variant nomenclature input and 
output, and a revised highlighting tool that now supports multiple simultaneous 
regions and colors.
