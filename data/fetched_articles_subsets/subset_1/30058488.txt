BACKGROUND: It is well documented in the scientific literature that high blood 
pressure can lead to cardiovascular disease. Untreated hypertension has clinical 
consequences such as coronary artery disease, stroke or kidney failure. 
Diltiazem hydrochloride (DH), a calcium-channel blocker, and perindopril 
erbumine (PE), an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme are used for 
the management of hypertension.
OBJECTIVE: This project will examine the effect of microneedle rollers on the 
transport of DH and PE across pig ear skin. The use of the transcutaneous route 
of administration reduces and in sometimes eliminates the trauma and pain 
associated with injections. Furthermore, there is increased patient compliance. 
The purpose of this project was to study the effect of stainless steel 
microneedles on the transdermal delivery of DH and PE.
METHOD: We utilized vertical Franz diffusion cells to study in vitro transport 
of DH and PE across microneedle- treated pig ear skin. Confocal laser scanning 
microscopy (CLSM) was used to characterize microchannel depth. Transdermal flux 
values were determined from the slope of the linear portion of the cumulative 
amount versus time curve.
RESULTS: There was a 113.59-fold increase in the transdermal permeation of DH 
following the application of microneedle roller compared to passive diffusion.
CONCLUSION: In the case of PE, there was an 11.99-fold increase in the drug 
transport across pig skin following the application of microneedle rollers in 
comparison with passive diffusion. Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney's rank sum 
test were used to determine statistically significant differences between 
experimental and control groups.
