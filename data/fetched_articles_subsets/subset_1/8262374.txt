Two open reading frames (ORFs) of African swine fever virus (ASFV) encoding 
putative helicases have been sequenced. The two genes, termed D1133L and B962L, 
are located in the central region of the viral genome, but are separated by 
about 40 kb of DNA. Both genes are expressed late during ASFV infection of Vero 
cells, after replication of viral DNA has begun. Contiguous to D1133L, three 
other ORFs (D129L, D79L and D339L), encoding putative proteins of unknown 
function, have been sequenced. Proteins D1133L and B962L contain the amino acid 
motifs that characterize helicases of superfamily II. D1133L is most similar to 
a group of putative helicases which includes two proteins of vaccinia virus 
(D11L and D6R) involved in transcription of the viral genome, their homologues 
in other poxviruses, the protein encoded by ORF 4 of the yeast plasmids, pGKL2 
and pSKL, and the previously identified ASFV protein, Q706L. B962L resembles a 
group of RNA-helicase-like proteins which includes three proteins of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae involved in pre-mRNA splicing (PRP2, PRP16 and PRP22), 
Drosophila melanogaster KURZ and MLE, and vaccinia virus 18R.
