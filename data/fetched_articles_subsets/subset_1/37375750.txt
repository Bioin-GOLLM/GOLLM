In the present study, we characterize the biological activity of a newly 
designed and synthesized series of 15 compounds 
2-[2-hydroxy-3-(4-substituted-1-piperazinyl)propyl] derivatives of 
pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole 3a-3o. The compounds were obtained with good yields of 
pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole scaffold 2a-2c with secondary amines in C2H5OH. The 
chemical structures of the compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 
FT-IR, and MS. All the new compounds were investigated for their potencies to 
inhibit the activity of three enzymes, i.e., COX-1, COX-2, and LOX, by a 
colorimetric inhibitor screening assay. In order to analyze the structural basis 
of interactions between the ligands and cyclooxygenase/lipooxygenase, 
experimental data were supported by the results of molecular docking 
simulations. The data indicate that all of the tested compounds influence the 
activity of COX-1, COX-2, and LOX.
