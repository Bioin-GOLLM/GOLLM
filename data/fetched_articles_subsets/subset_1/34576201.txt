The aim of this literature review is to examine the significance of the 
nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) gene in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This will include 
analysis of the structure and normal cellular function of NPM1, the type of 
mutations commonly witnessed in NPM1, and the mechanism by which this influences 
the development and progression of AML. The importance of NPM1 mutation on 
prognosis and the treatment options available to patients will also be reviewed 
along with current guidelines recommending the rapid return of NPM1 mutational 
screening results and the importance of employing a suitable laboratory assay to 
achieve this. Finally, future developments in the field including research into 
new therapies targeting NPM1 mutated AML are considered.
