Dystrophinopathies result from mutations to the DMD gene. We report 5 boys in 3 
families with heterogenous phenotypes due to a point mutation in the DMD gene: a 
hemizygous tyrosine-to-cysteine change in exon 15 (c.1724T>C) resulting in an 
amino acid substitution of leucine to proline at codon 575. This mutation has 
been reported before, with at least 3 prior patients presenting with similar 
clinical findings of myalgia, myoglobinuria, and occasional muscle cramping. The 
mutation on DMD c.1724T>C (p.Leu575Pro) is listed in the Clinvar database as a 
variant of unknown significance. Our report provides contributing evidence that 
this alteration should be classified as pathogenic.
