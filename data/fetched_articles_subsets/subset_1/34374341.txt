Nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) is an integral part of essential cellular processes, 
including adhesion and migration. Mammalian cells express up to three isoforms 
termed NM IIA, B, and C. We used U2OS cells to create CRISPR/Cas9-based 
knockouts of all three isoforms and analyzed the phenotypes on homogenously 
coated surfaces, in collagen gels, and on micropatterned substrates. In contrast 
to homogenously coated surfaces, a structured environment supports a cellular 
phenotype with invaginated actin arcs even in the absence of NM IIA-induced 
contractility. A quantitative shape analysis of cells on micropatterns combined 
with a scale-bridging mathematical model reveals that NM IIA is essential to 
build up cellular tension during initial stages of force generation, while NM 
IIB is necessary to elastically stabilize NM IIA-generated tension. A dynamic 
cell stretch/release experiment in a three-dimensional scaffold confirms these 
conclusions and in addition reveals a novel role for NM IIC, namely the ability 
to establish tensional homeostasis.
