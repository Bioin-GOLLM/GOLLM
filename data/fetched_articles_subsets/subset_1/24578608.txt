OBJECTIVE: Definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 
cisplatin (CDDP) is one of the standard therapies for esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC); however, inter-individual variations in clinical outcomes have 
yet to be investigated. In the present study, single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in SLC23A2 gene were retrospectively evaluated in 49 Japanese patients 
with ESCC who were treated with a definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT, and the 
predictive values for the clinical response, severe acute toxicities, and 
long-term survival were assessed.
METHODS: A course consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-FU at 400 
mg/m(2)/day for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP at 40 mg/m(2)/day on 
days 1 and 8, and radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1 to 5, 8 to 12, and 15 to 19, 
with a second course being repeated after a 2-week interval. The SLC23A2 SNPs 
rs2681116, rs13037458, rs1715364, rs4987219, and rs1110277 were evaluated.
RESULTS: The rs2681116 and rs13037458 had a tendency to predict the clinical 
response (p=0.144 and 0.085, respectively) and long-term survival (p=0.142 and 
0.056, respectively). The rs4987219 and rs1110277 correlated with severe acute 
leukopenia (p=0.025) and stomatitis (p=0.019), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations with a larger number of patients or an in 
vitro study are needed to confirm the predictive values of genetic polymorphisms 
in SLC23A2.
