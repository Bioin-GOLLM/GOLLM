The single-cell green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii possesses two α-tubulin 
genes (tua1 and tua2) and two β-tubulin genes (tub1 and tub2), with the two 
genes in each pair encoding identical amino acid sequences. Here, we screened an 
insertional library to establish eight disruptants with defective tua2, tub1, or 
tub2 expression. Most of the disruptants did not exhibit major defects in cell 
growth, flagellar length, or flagellar regeneration after amputation. Because 
few tubulin mutants of C. reinhardtii have been reported to date, we then used 
our disruptants, together with a tua1 disruptant obtained from the Chlamydomonas 
Library Project (CLiP), to isolate tubulin-mutants resistant to the anti-tubulin 
agents propyzamide (pronamide) or oryzalin. As a result of several trials, we 
obtained 8 strains bearing 7 different α-tubulin mutations and 12 strains 
bearing 7 different β-tubulin mutations. One of the mutations is at a residue 
similar to that of a mutation site known to confer drug resistance in human 
cancer cells. Some strains had the same amino acid substitutions as those 
reported previously in C. reinhardtii; however, the mutants with single tubulin 
genes showed slightly stronger drug-resistance than the previous mutants that 
express the mutated tubulin in addition to the wild-type tubulin. Such increased 
drug-resistance may have facilitated sensitive detection of tubulin mutation. 
Single-tubulin-gene disruptants are thus an efficient background of generating 
tubulin mutants for the study of the structure-function relationship of tubulin.
