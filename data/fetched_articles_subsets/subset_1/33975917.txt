The stem cell-specific RNA-binding protein TRIM71/LIN-41 was the first 
identified target of the pro-differentiation and tumor suppressor miRNA let-7. 
TRIM71 has essential functions in embryonic development and a proposed oncogenic 
role in several cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we show 
that TRIM71 regulates let-7 expression and activity via two independent 
mechanisms. On the one hand, TRIM71 enhances pre-let-7 degradation through its 
direct interaction with LIN28 and TUT4, thereby inhibiting let-7 maturation and 
indirectly promoting the stabilization of let-7 targets. On the other hand, 
TRIM71 represses the activity of mature let-7 via its RNA-dependent interaction 
with the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) effector protein AGO2. We found 
that TRIM71 directly binds and stabilizes let-7 targets, suggesting that let-7 
activity inhibition occurs on active RISCs. MiRNA enrichment analysis of several 
transcriptomic datasets from mouse embryonic stem cells and human hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells suggests that these let-7 regulatory mechanisms shape 
transcriptomic changes during developmental and oncogenic processes. Altogether, 
our work reveals a novel role for TRIM71 as a miRNA repressor and sheds light on 
a dual mechanism of let-7 regulation.
