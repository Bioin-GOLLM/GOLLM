A recurrent mutation in FOXL2 (c.402C>G; p.C134W) is present in over 95% of 
adult-type granulosa cell tumours (AGCTs). In contrast, various loss-of-function 
mutations in FOXL2 lead to the development of blepharophimosis, ptosis, and 
epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES). BPES is characterised by an eyelid 
malformation often accompanied with primary ovarian insufficiency. Two recent 
studies suggest that FOXL2 C402G is a gain- or change-of-function mutation with 
altered DNA-binding specificity. Another study proposes that FOXL2 C402G is 
selectively targeted for degradation, inducing somatic haploinsufficiency, 
suggesting its role as a tumour suppressor. The latter study relies on data 
indicative of an FOXL2 allelic imbalance in AGCTs. Here we present RNA-seq data 
as genetic evidence that no real allelic imbalance is observed at the 
transcriptomic level in AGCTs. Additionally, there is no loss of protein 
expression in tumours harbouring the mutated allele. These data and other 
features of this mutation compared to other oncogenes and tumour suppressor 
genes argue strongly against FOXL2 being a tumour suppressor in this context. 
Given the likelihood that FOXL2 C402G is oncogenic, targeting the variant 
protein or its downstream consequences is the most viable path forward to 
identifying an effective treatment for this cancer. © 2021 The Pathological
