BACKGROUND: The gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been 
suggested as a candidate for major depression, and for depression susceptibility 
in different neurological and psychiatric diseases. No study has investigated 
the role of BDNF genetic variation and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the genetic contribution of BDNF 
Val66Met functional polymorphism to AD-related depression.
METHODS: Two-hundred and sixty-four AD patients underwent clinical and 
neuropsychological examination as well as an evaluation of behavioral and 
psychiatric disturbances. They were subsequently divided into two subgroups 
according to the presence (AD-D) or the absence (AD-nD), based on DSM-IV 
criteria for depression in AD. In each subject, BDNF Val66Met functional 
polymorphism and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were evaluated.
RESULTS: In our sample, 35.2% of patients (n=93) reported AD-related depressive 
symptoms. Compared to patients bearing no polymorphisms (BDNF G/G), BDNF G/A 
carriers showed more than twofold-time risk (OR=2.38; 95%CI=1.38-4.13), and BDNF 
A/A carriers had a threefold-time risk (OR=3.04; 95%CI=1.15-8.00) for depression 
in AD. Accordingly, considering the allele frequencies, BDNF A allele was 
significantly over-represented in AD-D (32.8%) compared to AD-nD (19.0%) 
(OR=2.08; 95%CI=1.38-3.13). An association between the number of carried A 
allele and the severity of depressive symptoms was observed (P<0.002). No effect 
of APOE genotype on risk for depression was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide evidence of BDNF genetic variation 
role in the susceptibility to AD-related depression. This study puts emphasis on 
the usefulness of considering genetic background for better defining 
individualized risk profiles in AD.
