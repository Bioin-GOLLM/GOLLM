PURPOSE: Knowledge of the contribution of high-penetrance susceptibility to 
familial colorectal cancer (CRC) is relevant to the counseling, treatment, and 
surveillance of CRC patients and families.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: To quantify the impact of germline mutation to familial 
CRC, we sequenced the mismatch repair genes (MMR) APC, MUTYH, and SMAD4/BMPR1A 
in 626 early-onset familial CRC cases ascertained through a population-based 
United Kingdom national registry. In addition, we evaluated the contribution of 
mutations in the exonuclease domain (exodom) of POLE and POLD1 genes that have 
recently been reported to confer CRC risk.
RESULTS: Overall mutations (pathogenic, likely pathogenic) in MMR genes make the 
highest contribution to familial CRC (10.9%). Mutations in the other established 
CRC genes account for 3.3% of cases. POLE/POLD1 exodom mutations were identified 
in three patients with family histories consistent with dominant transmission of 
CRC. Collectively, mutations in the known genes account for 14.2% of familial 
CRC (89 of 626 cases; 95% CI = 11.5, 17.2).
CONCLUSION: A genetic diagnosis is feasible in a high proportion of familial 
CRC. Mainstreaming such analysis in clinical practice should enable the medical 
management of patients and their families to be optimized. Findings suggest CRC 
screening of POLE and POLD1 mutation carriers should be comparable to that 
afforded to those at risk of HNPCC. Although the risk of CRC associated with 
unexplained familial CRC is in general moderate, in some families the risk is 
substantive and likely to be the consequence of unidentified genes, as 
exemplified by POLE and POLD1. Our findings have utility in the design of 
genetic analyses to identify such novel CRC risk genes.
