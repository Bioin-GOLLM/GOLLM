New antimalarial therapeutics are needed to ensure that malaria cases continue 
to be driven down, as both emerging parasite resistance to frontline 
chemotherapies and mosquito resistance to current insecticides threaten control 
programmes. Plasmodium, the apicomplexan parasite responsible for malaria, 
causes disease pathology through repeated cycles of invasion and replication 
within host erythrocytes (the asexual cycle). Antimalarial drugs primarily 
target this cycle, seeking to reduce parasite burden within the host as fast as 
possible and to supress recrudescence for as long as possible. Intense 
phenotypic drug screening efforts have identified a number of promising new 
antimalarial molecules. Particularly important is the identification of 
compounds with new modes of action within the parasite to combat existing drug 
resistance and suitable for formulation of efficacious combination therapies. 
Here we detail the antimalarial properties of DDD01034957-a novel antimalarial 
molecule which is fast-acting and potent against drug resistant strains in 
vitro, shows activity in vivo, and possesses a resistance mechanism linked to 
the membrane transporter PfABCI3. These data support further medicinal chemistry 
lead-optimization of DDD01034957 as a novel antimalarial chemical class and 
provide new insights to further reduce in vivo metabolic clearance.
