The associations of ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms with recurrent 
pregnancy loss (RPL) in Iranian women have yielded controversial results. Thus, 
we conducted a meta-analysis to obtain more certain results. A comprehensive 
literature search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, MedRxiv, 
SID, and CNKI databases up to January 1st, 2021, using the appropriate terms. 
All case-control studies were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of associations. A total of 
14 studies including eight studies with 783 patients and 761 healthy subjects on 
ACE I/D and six studies with 1.155 patients and 699 healthy subjects on PAI-1 
4G/5G were included. Combined data revealed that ACE I/D polymorphism was 
significantly associated with RPL risk in Iranian women under three models i.e., 
allele [OR=0.744, 95% CI: (0.640-0.864); p≤0.001], dominant [OR=0.774, 95% CI: 
(0.601-0.996); p=0.047], and recessive [OR=0.767, 95% CI: (0.611-0.963); 
p=0.022]. Moreover, the pooled data showed a significant association between the 
PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and RPL risk under all five models i.e., allele 
[OR=2.352, 95% CI: (1.623-3.408); p≤0.001], heterozygote [OR=8.364, 95% CI: 
(4.744-14.756); p≤0.001), homozygote [OR=2.192, 95% CI: (1.093-4.394); p=0.027), 
dominant [OR=2.354, 95% CI: (1.309-4.235); p=0.004], and recessive [OR=5.208, 
95% CI: (3.005-9.025); p≤0.001]. Stratification analysis revealed that these 
polymorphisms were associated with RPL risk by the number of miscarriages. Our 
pooled data indicated that ACE I/D and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms were 
significantly associated with an increased risk of RPL in Iranian women. These 
significant findings showed that the investigation might be adequate for ACE I/D 
and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms in the Iranian population.
