OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to explore the expression profiles of 
circular RNAs (circRNAs) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in an attempt to 
identify potential core genes in the pathogenesis of this tumor.
METHODS: Differentially expressed circRNAs were screened between tumor tissues 
from five GBM patients and five normal brain samples using Illumina Hiseq. 
Bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze their potential function. CircBRAF 
was further detected in different WHO grades glioma tissues and normal brain 
tissues. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox's analysis were used to 
analyze the association between circBRAF expression level and prognosis of 
glioma patients.
RESULTS: A total of 1411 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in 
GBM patients including 206 upregulated circRNAs and 1205 downregulated circRNAs. 
Differential expression of circRNAs was closely associated with the biological 
process and molecular function. The downregulated circRNAs were mainly 
associated with ErbB and Neurotrophin signaling pathways. Moreover, the 
expression level of circBRAF in normal brain tissues was significantly higher 
than that in glioma tissues (P<.001). CircBRAF was significantly lower in glioma 
patients with high pathological grade (WHO III & IV) than those with low grade 
(WHO I & II) (P<.001). Cox analysis revealed that high circBRAF expression was 
an independent biomarker for predicting good progression-free survival and 
overall survival in glioma patients (HR=0.413, 95% CI 0.201-0.849; HR=0.299, 95% 
CI 0.135-0.661; respectively).
CONCLUSION: The present study identified a profile of dysregulated circRNAs in 
GBM. Bioinformatics analysis showed that dysregulated circRNAs might be 
associated with tumorigenesis and development of GBM. In addition, circBRAF 
could severe as a biomarker for predicting pathological grade and prognosis in 
glioma patients.
