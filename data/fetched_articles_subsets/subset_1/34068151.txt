Severe burns represent an important challenge for patients and medical teams. 
They lead to profound metabolic alterations, trigger a systemic inflammatory 
response, crush the immune defense, impair the function of the heart, lungs, 
kidneys, liver, etc. The metabolism is shifted towards a hypermetabolic state, 
and this situation might persist for years after the burn, having deleterious 
consequences for the patient's health. Severely burned patients lack energy 
substrates and react in order to produce and maintain augmented levels of 
glucose, which is the fuel "ready to use" by cells. In this paper, we discuss 
biological substances that induce a hyperglycemic response, concur to insulin 
resistance, and determine cell disturbance after a severe burn. We also focus on 
the most effective agents that provide pharmacological modulations of the 
changes in glucose metabolism.
