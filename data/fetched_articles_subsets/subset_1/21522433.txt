In the title compound, C(15)H(9)F(4)N(3)O(2)S, the N,N'-disubstituted thio-urea 
fragment adopts a cis,trans geometry, stabilized by an intra-molecular N-H⋯O 
hydrogen bond to the carbonyl O atom of the tetra-fluoro-benzoyl group. The 
central thio-urea group makes dihedral angles of 47.79 (7) and 35.54 (8)° with 
the two aromatic rings. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked via N-H⋯O and 
N-H⋯S hydrogen bonds into two-dimensional polymeric structures parallel to 
(100). In turn, π-π stacking inter-actions between tetra-fluoro-benzene and 
benzene units [centroid-centroid distance = 3.996 (10) Å; dihedral angle = 
13.60 (8)°] organize these two-dimensional assemblies into a three-dimensional 
framework.
