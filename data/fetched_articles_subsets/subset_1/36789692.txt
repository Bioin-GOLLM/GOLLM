TurboID, a proximity labelling method based on mutant biotin ligase, is an 
efficient new technique for recognizing protein-protein interactions and has 
been successfully applied to living cells. Sialic acid is typically the terminal 
monosaccharide attached to many glycoproteins and plays many important roles in 
many biological processes. However, the lack of enrichment methods for terminal 
sialic acid glycosylation in vivo hinders the identification and analysis of 
this glycosylation. Here, we introduce TurboID to identify terminal sialic acid 
glycosylation in living cells. SpCBM, the carbohydrate-binding domain of 
sialidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae, is fused with TurboID and overexpressed 
in HeLa cells. After streptavidin-based purification and detection by mass 
spectrometry, 31 terminal sialic acid N-glycosylated sites and 1359 putative 
terminal sialic acid glycosylated proteins are identified, many of which are 
located in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
