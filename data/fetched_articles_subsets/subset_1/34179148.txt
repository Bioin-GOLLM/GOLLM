Maintaining cholesterol homeostasis is essential for normal cellular and 
systemic functions. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a mechanism to 
fine-tune numerous biological processes by controlling gene expression. LncRNAs 
have emerged as important regulators in cholesterol homeostasis. Dysregulation 
of lncRNAs expression is associated with lipid-related diseases, suggesting that 
manipulating the lncRNAs expression could be a promising therapeutic approach to 
ameliorate liver disease progression and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, 
given the high-abundant lncRNAs and the poor genetic conservation between 
species, much work is required to elucidate the specific role of lncRNAs in 
regulating cholesterol homeostasis. In this review, we highlighted the latest 
advances in the pivotal role and mechanism of lncRNAs in regulating cholesterol 
homeostasis. These findings provide novel insights into the underlying 
mechanisms of lncRNAs in lipid-related diseases and may offer potential 
therapeutic targets for treating lipid-related diseases.
