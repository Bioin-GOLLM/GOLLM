The triple A syndrome (MIM 231550) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by adrenal insufficiency, achalasia and alacrima. The frequent 
association with a variety of neurological features may result in a severely 
disabling disease. We previously mapped the syndrome to a 6 cM interval on 
chromosome 12q13 and have now refined the critical region to 0 cM between KRT8 
and D12S1651. Overlapping bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences of a 
high resolution BAC/P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) contig were screened 
for gene content and a novel gene encoding a 546 amino acid polypeptide was 
identified. In nine triple A syndrome patients eight different homozygous and 
compound heterozygous mutations were found in this gene, most of them leading to 
a truncated protein suggesting loss of function. RNA blotting experiments 
revealed marked expression in neuroendocrine and gastrointestinal structures, 
which are predominantly affected in triple A syndrome, supporting the hypothesis 
that mutations in this triple A syndrome gene (AAAS) are responsible for the 
disease. The predicted protein belongs to the family of WD repeat-containing 
proteins which exhibit a high degree of functional diversity including 
regulation of signal transduction, RNA processing and transcription.
