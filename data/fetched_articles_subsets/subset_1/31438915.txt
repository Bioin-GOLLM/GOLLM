BACKGROUND: Subjects with prediabetes are at increased risk of future T2DM and 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to NGT individuals. The OGTT 
(FPG = 100-125 and 2 h-PG = 140-199 mg/dl) and HbA1c 5.7-6.4% have been used to 
diagnose subjects with prediabetes. In the present study, we compared the 
ability of the OGTT and HbA1c to identify Qatari subjects with prediabetes.
METHODS: Four hundred forty six subjects without a history of T2DM received 75-g 
OGTT and measurement of HbA1c. The incidence of prediabetes in this cohort 
according to OGTT criteria was compared to that of HbA1c criteria.
RESULTS: The agreement between the OGTT and HbA1c in identifying subjects with 
prediabetes in Qatari subjects was poor, though significant (k = 015, 
p < 0.0001). Only 56% of participants had prediabetes or NGT according to OGTT 
and HbA1c. The disagreement between OGTT and HbA1c in diagnosing prediabetes was 
primarily due to low sensitivity of HbA1c. Moreover, subjects with prediabetes 
diagnosed with the OGTT have more severe metabolic profile than prediabetic 
subjects diagnosed with HbA1c. Lastly, more subjects with the metabolic syndrome 
were identified with OGTT (60%) criteria than with the HbA1c (49%), p < 0.0001.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate subjects with prediabetes diagnosed with 
OGTT have more severe metabolic risk than those diagnosed with HbA1c, and more 
likely to have greater risk of progression to T2DM.
