Late stage epithelial ovarian cancer has a dismal prognosis. Identification of 
pharmacogenomic markers (i.e. polymorphisms) to stratify patients to optimize 
individual therapy is of paramount importance. We here report the retrospective 
analysis of polymorphisms in 5 genes (ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2 and CDK12) involved 
in the cellular response to platinum in a cohort of 240 cancer patients with 
late stage ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate 
associations between the above mentioned SNPs and patients' clinical outcomes: 
overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). None of the ATM, ATR, 
Chk1 and Chk2 polymorphisms was found to significantly affect OS nor PFS in this 
cohort of patients. Genotype G/G of CDK12 polymorphism (rs1054488) predicted 
worse OS and PFS than the genotype A/A-A/G in univariate analysis. The 
predictive value was lost in the multivariate analysis. The positive correlation 
observed between this polymorphism and age, grade and residual tumor may explain 
why the CDK12 variant was not confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in 
multivariate analysis.The importance of CDK12 polymorphism as possible 
prognostic biomarker need to be confirmed in larger ovarian cancer cohorts, and 
possibly in other cancer population responsive to platinum agents.
