BACKGROUND: Correct chromosome segregation depends on the sister chromatid 
cohesion complex. The essential, evolutionarily conserved regulatory protein 
Irr1/Scc3, is responsible for the complex loading onto DNA and for its removal. 
We found that, unexpectedly, Irr1 is present not only in the nucleus but also in 
the cytoplasm.
RESULTS: We show that Irr1 protein is enriched in the cytoplasm upon arrest of 
yeast cells in G1 phase following nitrogen starvation, diauxic shift or Î±-factor 
action, and also during normal cell cycle. Despite the presence of numerous 
Crm1-dependent export signals, the cytoplasmic pool of Irr1 is not derived 
through export from the nucleus but instead is simply retained in the cytoplasm. 
Cytoplasmic Irr1 interacts with the Imi1 protein implicated in glutathione 
homeostasis and mitochondrial integrity.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides regulation of the sister chromatid cohesion complex in the 
nucleus Irr1 appears to have an additional role in the cytoplasm, possibly 
through interaction with the cytoplasmic protein Imi1.
