BACKGROUND: This study elucidates the profiles for hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
reactivation and genetic mutation of the core promoter and precore regions for 
HBV-carriers receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
METHODS: Sera from 20 HSCT patients diagnosed with hematological diseases, 13 
donors and 36 healthy HBV-carriers, were collected regularly for analysis. The 
hepatic biochemistry profiles, serological HBV markers, and HBV-DNA titers were 
checked regularly, and primer-amplification of the HBV core promoter or precore 
region and sequencing were performed once the mutations were identified.
RESULTS: Deteriorated liver function was demonstrated for 13 of 20 post-HSCT 
patients, compared with none of the 36 controls (P<0.01). The HBV-DNA was 
detected more frequently for post-HSCT subjects than for controls (P=0.001). 
Incidence of the HBV precore nucleotide 1896 G-to-A mutation was significantly 
higher for HSCT patients (P=0.004), and a significant association was 
demonstrated for carriage of core promoter or precore mutations and the 
development of hepatitis (P=0.015). Different HBV genotypes were revealed in 
post-HSCT patients and the respective donors.
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive chemotherapy and immunosuppression may cause HBV 
reactivation in HBV carriers receiving HSCT, and more frequent core promoter or 
precore mutations could be detected in HBV carriers receiving HSCT than healthy 
HBV carriers, with the chemotherapy/immunosuppression-induced immunocompromise 
possibly contributing to this effect. Donor HBV genotype did not interfere with 
that of the recipient after HSCT. Core promoter or precore region mutations were 
associated with a higher incidence of liver dysfunction than wild-type HBV 
carriers in the HSCT patients.
