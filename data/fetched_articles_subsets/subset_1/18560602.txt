Gastroesophageal reflux disease is regarded as a spectrum of diseases: 
non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), erosive reflux disease (ERD), and the far end 
of the spectrum represented by patients with Barrett's esophagus. Among 
predisposing factors, both risk and protective polymorphic variants of several 
genes may influence the clinical outcomes of reflux disease. Consequently, 
different molecular mechanisms are likely to underlie the development of 
clinical variants of reflux disease. Ninety six patients with reflux disease 
were screened for polymorphisms of CARD15, SLC22A4 (OCTN1), SLC22A5 (OCTN2), 
DLG5, ATG16L1 and IL23R genes which had previously been found to associate with 
immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disorders. While none of the polymorphisms 
were associated with NERD or ERD, the 1142G/A variant of the IL23R gene was 
found to be a risk variant in Barrett's esophagus patients. The IL23/IL23R 
pathway may modulate STAT3 transcriptional activity which is an essential 
regulator not only of immune-mediated inflammation, but also of 
inflammatory-associated apoptosis resistance. Although the mechanisms of 
metaplastic transition of inflamed squamous epithelium are undetermined as yet, 
our findings suggest potential involvement of alternations in the IL23/IL23R 
pathway as a molecular background of Barrett's esophagus development.
