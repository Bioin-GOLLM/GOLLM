AIM: To evaluate antithrombotic treatment patterns in patients in Italy with 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) before and after direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) were approved.
METHODS: This analysis included patients with a discharge diagnosis of NVAF in 
2010 and 2014, which constituted the pre- and post-DOACs populations, 
respectively.
RESULTS: Approximately 90% of patients were eligible for oral anticoagulant 
(OAC) therapy. Overall use of OACs increased from 38% in 2010 to 45% in 2014; 
use of antiplatelet therapy decreased from 36 to 25%. Approximately 14% of 
eligible patients remained untreated.
CONCLUSION: Although an improvement in OAC prescription was observed post-DOACs 
launch, treatment patterns in Italy suggest that a proportion of patients with 
NVAF are still undertreated or do not receive appropriate therapy.
