PURPOSEOF REVIEW: The pathogenesis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (eGPA) is driven largely by CD4 + type 2 helper T cells (Th2), B 
cells, and eosinophils. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are critical cytokines in 
Th2 cell-mediated inflammation; however, inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 does not 
reduce serum eosinophil counts and has even been associated with 
hypereosinophilia. This review explores the role of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in 
Th2-mediated inflammation to consider the potential clinical consequences of 
inhibiting these individual cytokines in eGPA.
RECENT FINDINGS: Treatments for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
(eGPA) are rapidly evolving through using biologic therapies to modulate the Th2 
inflammatory response via eosinophil inhibition. While IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and 
IL-25 can all affect eosinophils, only IL-5 inhibition has demonstrated 
therapeutic benefit to-date. In this review, we report a clinical vignette of a 
patient with adult-onset asthma who developed severe manifestations of eGPA 
after switching from mepolizumab (an IL-5 inhibitor) to dupilumab (an inhibitor 
of IL-4 and IL-13). By understanding the role of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in 
Th2-mediated vasculitis, we can start to understand how eGPA might respond 
differently to focused cytokine inhibition.
