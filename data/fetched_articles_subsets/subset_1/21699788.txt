BACKGROUND & AIMS: There are many genetic factors that are associated with both 
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). However, genetic factors that 
have distinct effects on UC and CD have not been examined.
METHODS: We performed a comparative genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a 
replication study using data from 748 patients with UC and 979 with CD, selected 
from a Japanese population. We conducted high-resolution (4-digit) genotyping of 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in patients with UC and CD and additional 
905 healthy individuals (controls). We performed haplotype-based analysis using 
data from the GWAS and HLA alleles to associate them with UC or CD.
RESULTS: The comparative GWAS and the replication study identified significant 
associations in the major histocompatibility complex region at 6p21 with UC and 
CD (rs9271366, P = 1.6 × 10⁻⁷⁰; odds ratio [OR] = 4.44). Haplotype-based 
analysis in the major histocompatibility complex region showed that 
HLA-Cw*1202-B*5201-DRB1*1502 haplotype was significantly associated with 
increased risk of UC compared with CD (P = 1.1 × 10⁻³³; OR = 6.58), accounting 
for most of the associations observed in the GWAS. Compared with the controls, 
this HLA haplotype significantly increases susceptibility to UC (P = 4.0 × 
10⁻²¹; OR = 2.65), but reduces risk for CD (P = 1.1 × 10⁻⁷; OR = 0.40). Distinct 
effects of this HLA haplotype on UC and CD were independent of other HLA alleles 
and haplotypes (P = 2.0 × 10⁻¹⁹ and P = 7.2 × 10⁻⁵, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The HLA-Cw*1202-B*5201-DRB1*1502 haplotype increases susceptibility 
to UC but reduces risk for CD, based on a GWAS of a Japanese population.
