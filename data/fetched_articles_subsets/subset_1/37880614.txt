INTRODUCTION: Self-limited infantile epilepsy (SeLIE) is a benign epilepsy. 
Previous studies have shown that monotherapy with most antiseizure medications 
can effectively relieve seizures in patients with SeLIE, but the efficacy of 
levetiracetam has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of levetiracetam in the 
treatment of SeLIE patients with PRRT2 mutations.
METHODS: The clinical data of 39 SeLIE patients (21 males and 18 females, aged 
4.79 ± 1.60 months) with pathogenic variants in PRRT2 or 16p11.2 microdeletion 
were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the use of initial antiseizure 
medication (ASM), the patients were classified into two groups: Levetiracetam 
group (LEG) and Other ASMs group (OAG). The difference of efficacy between the 
two groups was compared.
RESULTS: Among the 39 SeLIE patients, 16 were LEG (10 males and 6 females, aged 
5.25 ± 2.07 months), with whom two obtained a seizure-free status (12.50%) and 
14 ineffective or even deteriorated (87.50%). Among the 14 ineffective or 
deteriorated cases, 13 were seizure-controlled after replacing levetiracetam 
with other ASMs including topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and valproate, 
and the remaining one finally achieved remission at age 3. Of the 39 patients, 
23 were OAG (11 males and 12 females; aged 4.48 ± 1.12 months), of whom 22 
achieved seizure remission, except for one patient who was ineffective with 
topiramate initially and relieved by oxcarbazepine instead. Although there were 
no significant differences in gender and age of onset between the two groups, 
the effective rate was significantly different (12.50% in LEG vs. 95.65% in OAG) 
(P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The findings showed that patients with SeLIE caused by the PRRT2 
mutations did not benefit from the use of levetiracetam, but could benefit from 
other ASMs.
