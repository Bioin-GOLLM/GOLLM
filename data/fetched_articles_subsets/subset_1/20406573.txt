Iron deficiency in infancy negatively impacts a variety of neurodevelopmental 
processes at the time of nutrient insufficiency, with persistent central nervous 
system alterations and deficits in behavioral functioning, despite iron therapy. 
In rodent models, early iron deficiency impairs the hippocampus and the dopamine 
system. We examined the possibility that young adults who had experienced 
chronic, severe, iron deficiency as infants would exhibit deficits on 
neurocognitive tests with documented frontostriatal (Trail Making Test, 
Intra-/Extra-dimensional Shift, Stockings of Cambridge, Spatial Working Memory, 
Rapid Visual Information Processing) and hippocampal specificity (Pattern 
Recognition Memory, Spatial Recognition Memory). Participants with chronic, 
severe iron deficiency in infancy performed less well on frontostriatal-mediated 
executive functions, including inhibitory control, set-shifting, and planning. 
Participants also exhibited impairment on a hippocampus-based recognition memory 
task. We suggest that these deficits may result from the long-term effects of 
early iron deficiency on the dopamine system, the hippocampus, and their 
interaction.
