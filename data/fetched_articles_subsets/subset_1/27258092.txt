We report a method for obtaining turbid plaques of the lactococcal bacteriophage 
TP901-1 and its derivative TP901-BC1034. We have further used the method to 
isolate clear plaque mutants of this phage. Analysis of 8 such mutants that were 
unable to lysogenize the host included whole genome resequencing. Four of the 
mutants had different mutations in structural genes with no relation to the 
genetic switch. However all 8 mutants had a mutation in the cI repressor gene 
region. Three of these were located in the promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequences 
and five in the N-terminal part of the encoded CI protein involved in the DNA 
binding. The conclusion is that cI is the only gene involved in clear plaque 
formation i.e. the CI protein is the determining factor for the lysogenic 
pathway and its maintenance in the lactococcal phage TP901-1.
