Although current immune-checkpoint therapy (ICT) mainly targets lymphoid cells, 
it is associated with a broader remodeling of the tumor micro-environment. Here, 
using complementary forms of high-dimensional profiling, we define differences 
across all hematopoietic cells from syngeneic mouse tumors during unrestrained 
tumor growth or effective ICT. Unbiased assessment of gene expression of 
tumor-infiltrating cells by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and 
longitudinal assessment of cellular protein expression by mass cytometry (CyTOF) 
revealed significant remodeling of both the lymphoid and myeloid intratumoral 
compartments. Surprisingly, we observed multiple subpopulations of 
monocytes/macrophages, distinguishable by the markers CD206, CX3CR1, CD1d, and 
iNOS, that change over time during ICT in a manner partially dependent on IFNγ. 
Our data support the hypothesis that this macrophage polarization/activation 
results from effects on circulatory monocytes and early macrophages entering 
tumors, rather than on pre-polarized mature intratumoral macrophages.
