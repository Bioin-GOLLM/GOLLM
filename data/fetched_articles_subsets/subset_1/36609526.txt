LIM domain-binding 3 (LDB3) is a member of the Enigma family of PDZ-LIM 
proteins. LDB3 has been reported as a striated muscle-specific Z-band 
alternatively spliced protein that plays an important role in mechanosensory 
actin cytoskeleton remodeling. This study shows that LDB3 is broadly expressed 
in the central and peripheral nervous system of human and mouse. LDB3 is 
predominantly expressed in the adult stages compared to early development and at 
a significantly higher level in the spinal cord than in the brain. As in 
skeletal muscle and heart, LDB3 is extensively alternatively spliced in the 
neurons. Three novel splice isoforms were identified suggesting 
splicing-dependent regulation of LDB3 expression in the nervous system. 
Expression of LDB3 in the motor cortex, cerebellum, spinal motor neuron, 
peripheral nerve, and neuromuscular junction in addition to skeletal muscle 
indicates important roles for this PDZ-LIM family protein in motor planning and 
execution. Moreover, expression in the hippocampal neurons suggests roles for 
LDB3 in learning and memory. LDB3 interactors filamin C and myotilin are also 
expressed in the spinal motor neuron, nerve, and neuromuscular junction, thereby 
providing the basis for neurogenic manifestations in myopathies associated with 
mutations in these so-called muscle proteins.
