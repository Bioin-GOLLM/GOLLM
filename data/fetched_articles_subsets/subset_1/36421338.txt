BACKGROUND: A fixed dose of 200 mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) is the 
standard of care for patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
and PDL1 ≥50%. In April 2020, based on pharmacokinetic modeling without formal 
comparative studies, the FDA approved 400 mg every 6 weeks (Q6W). 
Pharmacokinetic studies also suggested comparable target engagement with 
weight-based and flat dosing for the respective schedules. The objective of this 
study was to determine if overall survival (OS) differs based on the Q3W vs. Q6W 
dosing schedule of pembrolizumab.
METHODS: BC Cancer patients with stage IV NSCLC and PDL1 ≥50% treated with 
pembrolizumab were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated with 
weight-based dosing, per institution standard, of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W or 4 
mg/kg Q6W. Patient demographics, treatment and outcome were recorded. Patients 
were assigned to Q3W or Q6W according to the schedule that was used for the 
majority of treatment (greater than 50%).
RESULTS: 718 patients with NSCLC and PDL1 ≥50% received first-line pembrolizumab 
between 2017 and2021, Q3W/Q6W dosing 677/41 patients. Baseline characteristics 
with respect to age, sex, smoking status, histology and performance status (PS) 
were similar between groups. In the multivariate model, including age, sex, PS 
and dosing schedule, the hazard ratio for death (HR) for OS Q3W vs. Q6W was 
0.759 (p = 0.230). A 2:1 case-matched analysis for OS was performed, controlling 
for sex, age ± 5 years, PS and duration on pembrolizumab ± 2 months for Q3W vs. 
Q6W (n = 113) with a HR 0.834 (p = 0.500).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no OS difference demonstrated with pembrolizumab dosing 
Q3W compared to Q6W in a multivariate analysis that included age, sex and PS. A 
case-matched analysis that controlled for these variables and for duration of 
treatment confirmed these findings. This study supports the use of Q6W 
pembrolizumab dosing, allowing for less frequent interactions with the medical 
system.
