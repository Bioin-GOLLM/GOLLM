Amish and Mennonite children with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) often 
die without treatment as a result of delayed diagnoses and prohibitive costs of 
therapy. In this detailed case report, we describe the novel use of DNA 
microarrays to improve the diagnosis and management of an Amish infant with 
SCID. Using 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes from the 
patient, her parents, and seven siblings, we identified the recombinase 
activating genes for diagnostic sequencing, and then characterized a novel 
pathogenic variant in RAG1 (c.2974A>G). The same genotype data were used to 
identify a sibling stem cell donor who was haplo-identical at human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) and blood group (ABO) loci. Autozygosity and linkage analysis of 
SNP genotypes within a family narrows the search for SCID candidate genes and 
provides a relatively simple and inexpensive way to identify potential tissue 
donors among biological siblings.
