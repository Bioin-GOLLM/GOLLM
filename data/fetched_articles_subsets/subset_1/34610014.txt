BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related death. Early detection is critical to reduce CRC morbidity and 
mortality. In order to meet this need, we developed a molecular clamping assay 
called the ColoScape TM assay for early colorectal cancer diagnostics.
METHODS: Nineteen mutations in four genes (APC, KRAS, BRAF and CTNNB1) 
associated with early events in CRC pathogenesis are targeted in the ColoScapeTM 
assay. Xenonucleic Acid (XNA)-mediated qPCR clamping technology was applied to 
minimize the wild-type background amplification in order to improve assay 
sensitivity of CRC mutation detection. The assay analytical performance was 
verified and validated, cfDNA and FFPE CRC patient samples were evaluated, and 
an ROC curve was applied to evaluate its performance.
RESULTS: The data showed that the assay analytical sensitivity was 0.5% Variant 
Allele Frequency, corresponding to ~7-8 copies of mutant DNA with 5 ng total DNA 
input per test. This assay is highly reproducible with intra-assay CV of <3% and 
inter-assay CV of <5%. We have investigated 380 clinical samples including 
plasma cfDNA and FFPE samples from patients with precancerous and different 
stages of CRC. The preliminary assay clinical specificity and sensitivity for 
CRC cfDNA were: 100% (95% CI, 80.3-97.5%) and 92.2% (95% CI, 94.7-100%), 
respectively, with AUC of 0.96; 96% specificity (95% CI, 77.6-99.7%) and 92% 
sensitivity (95% CI, 86.1-95.6%) with AUC of 0.94 for CRC FFPE; 95% specificity 
(95% CI, 82.5%-99.1%) and 62.5% sensitivity (95% CI, 35.8%-83.7%) with AUC of 
0.79 for precancerous lesions cfDNA.
CONCLUSIONS: The XNA-mediated molecular clamping assay is a rapid, precise, and 
sensitive assay for the detection of precancerous lesions cfDNA and CRC cfDNA or 
FFPE samples.
