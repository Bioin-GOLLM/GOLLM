The formation of ordered nanostructures by molecular self-assembly of proteins 
and peptides represents one of the principal directions in nanotechnology. 
Indeed, polyamides provide superior features as materials with diverse physical 
properties. A reductionist approach allowed the identification of extremely 
short peptide sequences, as short as dipeptides, which could form well-ordered 
amyloid-like β-sheet-rich assemblies comparable to supramolecular structures 
made of much larger proteins. Some of the peptide assemblies show remarkable 
mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics. Another direction of 
reductionism utilized a natural noncoded amino acid, α-aminoisobutryic acid, to 
form short superhelical assemblies. The use of this exceptional helix inducer 
motif allowed the fabrication of single heptad repeats used in various 
biointerfaces, including their use as surfactants and DNA-binding agents. Two 
additional directions of the reductionist approach include the use of peptide 
nucleic acids (PNAs) and coassembly techniques. The diversified accomplishments 
of the reductionist approach, as well as the exciting future advances it bears, 
are discussed.
