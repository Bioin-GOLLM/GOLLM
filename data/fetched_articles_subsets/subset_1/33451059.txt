Biliary tract cancer (BTC) compromises a heterogenous group of tumors with poor 
prognoses. Curative surgery remains the first choice for localized disease; 
however, most BTC patients have had unresectable or metastatic disease. The gold 
standard therapy for these patients is chemotherapy with gemcitabine and 
cisplatin. There are no consensus guidelines for standard treatment in a 
second-line setting, although the data of the ABC-06 trial showed a slight 
survival benefit from oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil combination chemotherapy. 
Recent progress in comprehensive genomic profiling for advanced BTC (ABTC) has 
helped to clarify tumorigenesis and facilitate the coming era of precision 
medicine. Generally, targeted agents fail to show significant clinical benefits 
in unselected populations. Only fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) 
fusion and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)- and BRAF mutation-enriched 
populations have survival benefits from the corresponding inhibitors. Several 
interesting targeted agents for monotherapies or combination therapies with 
other compounds are currently ongoing or recruiting. Here, we review the 
published data from clinical trials of second-line therapies after the failure 
of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in ABTC. The results were stratified by 
different genetic alternations, as well as by chemotherapy, targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy.
