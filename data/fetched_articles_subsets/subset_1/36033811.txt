Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial drug, and its therapeutic drug 
monitoring and individualized treatment have been challenged since its approval. 
With the in-depth clinical research of linezolid, we have changed our attitude 
toward its therapeutic drug monitoring and our view of individualized treatment. 
On the basis of summarizing the existing clinical studies, and based on the 
practical experience of each expert in their respective professional fields, we 
have formed this expert consensus. Our team of specialists is a 
multidisciplinary team that includes pharmacotherapists, clinical pharmacology 
specialists, critical care medicine specialists, respiratory specialists, 
infectious disease specialists, emergency medicine specialists and more. We are 
committed to the safe and effective use of linezolid in patients in need, and 
the promotion of its therapeutic drug monitoring.
