INTRODUCTION: Oncogenic activation of the K-ras gene occurs in >90% of 
pancreatic ductal carcinoma and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
this malignancy. Increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has also been 
observed in a wide spectrum of cancers. This study aimed to investigate the 
mechanistic association between K-ras-induced transformation and increased ROS 
stress and its therapeutic implications in pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: ROS level, NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and expression, and cell 
invasion were examined in human pancreatic duct epithelial E6E7 cells 
transfected with K-ras (G12V) compared with parental E6E7 cells. The cytotoxic 
effect and antitumor effect of capsaicin, a NOX inhibitor, were also tested in 
vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: K-ras transfection caused activation of the membrane-associated redox 
enzyme NOX and elevated ROS generation through the phosphatidylinositol 
3'-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Importantly, capsaicin preferentially inhibited the 
enzyme activity of NOX and induced severe ROS accumulation in K-ras-transformed 
cells compared with parental E6E7 cells. Furthermore, capsaicin effectively 
inhibited cell proliferation, prevented invasiveness of K-ras-transformed 
pancreatic cancer cells, and caused minimum toxicity to parental E6E7 cells. In 
vivo, capsaicin exhibited antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer and 
showed oxidative damage to the xenograft tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: K-ras oncogenic signaling causes increased ROS stress through NOX, 
and abnormal ROS stress can selectively kill tumor cells by using NOX 
inhibitors. Our study provides a basis for developing a novel therapeutic 
strategy to effectively kill K-ras-transformed cells through a redox-mediated 
mechanism.
