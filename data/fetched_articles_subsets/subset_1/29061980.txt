Pompe disease, a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of the 
lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA), is characterized by glycogen accumulation, 
triggering severe secondary cellular damage and resulting in progressive motor 
handicap and premature death. Numerous disease-causing mutations in the gaa gene 
have been reported, but the structural effects of the pathological variants were 
unknown. Here we present the high-resolution crystal structures of recombinant 
human GAA (rhGAA), the standard care of Pompe disease. These structures portray 
the unbound form of rhGAA and complexes thereof with active site-directed 
inhibitors, providing insight into substrate recognition and the molecular 
framework for the rationalization of the deleterious effects of disease-causing 
mutations. Furthermore, we report the structure of rhGAA in complex with the 
allosteric pharmacological chaperone N-acetylcysteine, which reveals the 
stabilizing function of this chaperone at the structural level.
