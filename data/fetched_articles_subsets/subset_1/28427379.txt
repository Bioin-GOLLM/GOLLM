BACKGROUND: Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) 
is the second most common heritable autoinflammatory disease, typically 
presenting in pre-school aged children with fever episodes lasting 1-3 weeks. 
Systemic symptoms can include rash, myalgia, ocular inflammation, and serositis.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report an unusual presentation of TRAPS in a 7 month 
old girl who presented with only persistent fever. She was initially diagnosed 
with incomplete Kawasaki Disease and received IVIG and infliximab; however, her 
fevers quickly recurred. Subsequent testing revealed a urinary tract infection, 
but she did not improve despite appropriate therapy. As fever continued, she 
developed significant abdominal distension with imaging concerning for 
appendicitis, followed by hyperthermia and hemodynamic instability. Given her 
protracted clinical course and maternal history of a poorly defined inflammatory 
condition, an autoinflammatory disease was considered. Therapy with anakinra was 
initiated, resulting in rapid resolution of fever and normalization of 
inflammatory markers. She was found to have a previously unreported mutation, 
Thr90Pro, in the TNFRSF1A gene associated with TRAPS. This novel mutation was 
also confirmed in the patient's mother and maternal uncle.
CONCLUSIONS: This report reviews a severe case of TRAPS in infancy associated 
with a novel mutation, Thr90Pro, in the TNFRSF1A gene, and emphasizes that 
autoinflammatory disease should be considered in the differential of infants 
with fever of unknown origin.
