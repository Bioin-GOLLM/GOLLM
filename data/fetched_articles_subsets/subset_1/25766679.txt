α-Synucleinopathies (ASP) comprise adult-onset, progressive neurodegenerative 
disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and 
multiple system atrophy (MSA) that are characterized by α-synuclein (AS) 
aggregates in neurons or glia. PD and DLB feature neuronal AS-positive 
inclusions termed Lewy bodies (LB) whereas glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs, 
Papp-Lantos bodies) are recognized as the defining hallmark of MSA. Furthermore, 
AS-positive cytoplasmic aggregates may also be seen in astroglial cells of 
PD/DLB and MSA brains. The glial AS-inclusions appear to trigger reduced trophic 
support resulting in neuronal loss. Moreover, microgliosis and astrogliosis can 
be found throughout the neurodegenerative brain and both are key players in the 
initiation and progression of ASP. In this review, we will highlight 
AS-dependent alterations of glial function and their impact on neuronal 
vulnerability thereby providing a detailed summary on the multifaceted role of 
glia in ASP.
