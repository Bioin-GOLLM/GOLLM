We present a unique 11-year-old girl showing clinical features of Rett-related 
disorder with distinctive facial features and multiple congenital anomalies 
including ocular hypertelorism, arched eyebrows, a broad nose, dental anomalies, 
congenital heart disease, truncal obesity, and epilepsy. A novel de novo 
mutation in histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) (c.652G > T, p.Gly218Cys) was 
confirmed by whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. X-chromosome 
inactivation analysis on DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed 
a completely skewed pattern associated with an inactive maternal allele. Late 
clinical loss of acquired purposeful hand movements and psychomotor 
deterioration may be a feature of Rett-related disorder, while distinctive 
facial features and multiple congenital anomalies are reminiscent of Cornelia de 
Lange syndrome.
