Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with the progression of a 
wide range of cancers including breast, glioma, lung, and liver cancer. The 
observation that EGFR inhibition can limit the growth of EGFR positive cancers 
has led to the development of various EGFR inhibitors including monoclonal 
antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors. However, the reported toxicity and 
drug resistance greatly compromised the clinical outcome of such inhibitors. As 
a type of chemical antibodies, nucleic acid aptamer provides an opportunity to 
overcome the obstacles faced by current EGFR inhibitors. In this study, we have 
developed and investigated the therapeutic potential of a 27mer aptamer 
CL-4RNV616 containing 2'-O-Methyl RNA and DNA nucleotides. Our results showed 
that CL-4RNV616 not only displayed enhanced stability in human serum, but also 
effectively recognized and inhibited the proliferation of EGFR positive Huh-7 
liver cancer, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, and U87MG glioblastoma cells, with an 
IC50 value of 258.9 nM, 413.7 nM, and 567.9 nM, respectively. Furthermore, TUNEL 
apoptosis assay revealed that CL-4RNV616 efficiently induced apoptosis of cancer 
cells. In addition, clinical breast cancer biopsy-based immunostaining assay 
demonstrated that CL-4RNV616 had a comparable detection efficacy for EGFR 
positive breast cancer with commonly used commercial antibodies. Based on the 
results, we firmly believe that CL-4RNV616 could be useful in the development of 
targeted cancer therapeutics and diagnostics.
