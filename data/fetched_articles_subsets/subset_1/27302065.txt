The regulated movement of glucose across mammalian cell membranes is mediated by 
facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) embedded in lipid bilayers. Despite 
the known importance of phospholipids in regulating protein structure and 
activity, the lipid-induced effects on the GLUTs remain poorly understood. We 
systematically examined the effects of physiologically relevant phospholipids on 
glucose transport in liposomes containing purified GLUT4 and GLUT3. The anionic 
phospholipids, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and 
phosphatidylinositol, were found to be essential for transporter function by 
activating it and stabilizing its structure. Conical lipids, 
phosphatidylethanolamine and diacylglycerol, enhanced transporter activity up to 
3-fold in the presence of anionic phospholipids but did not stabilize protein 
structure. Kinetic analyses revealed that both lipids increase the kcat of 
transport without changing the Km values. These results allowed us to elucidate 
the activation of GLUT by plasma membrane phospholipids and to extend the field 
of membrane protein-lipid interactions to the family of structurally and 
functionally related human solute carriers.
