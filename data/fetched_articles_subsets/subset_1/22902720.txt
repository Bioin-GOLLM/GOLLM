Phasic activation of the dopamine (DA) midbrain system in response to unexpected 
reward or novelty is critical for adaptive behavioral strategies. This 
activation of DA midbrain neurons occurs via a synaptically triggered switch 
from low-frequency background spiking to transient high-frequency burst firing. 
We found that, in medial DA neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), activity of 
ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channels enabled NMDA-mediated bursting in vitro 
as well as spontaneous in vivo burst firing in anesthetized mice. Cell-selective 
silencing of K-ATP channel activity in medial SN DA neurons revealed that their 
K-ATP channel-gated burst firing was crucial for novelty-dependent exploratory 
behavior. We also detected a transcriptional upregulation of K-ATP channel and 
NMDA receptor subunits, as well as high in vivo burst firing, in surviving SN DA 
neurons from Parkinson's disease patients, suggesting that burst-gating K-ATP 
channel function in DA neurons affects phenotypes in both disease and health.
