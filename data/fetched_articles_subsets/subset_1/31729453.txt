We introduce machine learning (ML) to perform classification and quantitation of 
images of nuclei from human blood neutrophils. Here we assessed the use of 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using free, open source software to 
accurately quantitate neutrophil NETosis, a recently discovered process involved 
in multiple human diseases. CNNs achieved >94% in performance accuracy in 
differentiating NETotic from non-NETotic cells and vastly facilitated 
dose-response analysis and screening of the NETotic response in neutrophils from 
patients. Using only features learned from nuclear morphology, CNNs can 
distinguish between NETosis and necrosis and between distinct NETosis signaling 
pathways, making them a precise tool for NETosis detection. Furthermore, by 
using CNNs and tools to determine object dispersion, we uncovered differences in 
NETotic nuclei clustering between major NETosis pathways that is useful in 
understanding NETosis signaling events. Our study also shows that neutrophils 
from patients with sickle cell disease were unresponsive to one of two major 
NETosis pathways. Thus, we demonstrate the design, performance, and 
implementation of ML tools for rapid quantitative and qualitative cell analysis 
in basic science.
