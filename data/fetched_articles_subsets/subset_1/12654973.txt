The authors searched for mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein in a 
Spanish family with a hereditary syndrome of hemorrhagic stroke, dementia, 
leukoencephalopathy, and occipital calcifications. DNA from two affected members 
demonstrated the Iowa amyloid precursor protein mutation previously identified 
as a cause of severe amyloid angiopathy without hemorrhagic stroke. These data 
point to other genetic or environmental factors that may determine the 
occurrence of symptomatic hemorrhage in amyloid angiopathy.
