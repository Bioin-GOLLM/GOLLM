RAS is frequently mutated in human cancers with nearly 20% of all cancers 
harboring mutations in one of three RAS isoforms (KRAS, HRAS, or NRAS). 
Furthermore, RAS proteins are critical oncogenic drivers of tumorigenesis. As 
such, RAS has been a prime focus for development of targeted cancer 
therapeutics. Although RAS is viewed by many as undruggable, the recent 
development of allele-specific covalent inhibitors to KRAS(G12C) has provided 
significant hope for the eventual pharmacological inhibition of RAS (Ostrem et 
al., Nature 503(7477):548-551, 2013; Patricelli et al., Cancer Discov 
6(3):316-329, 2016; Janes et al., Cell 172(3):578-589.e17, 2018; Canon et al., 
Nature 575(7781):217-223, 2019; Hallin et al., Cancer Discov 10(1):54-71, 2020). 
Indeed, these (G12C)-specific inhibitors have elicited promising responses in 
early phase clinical trials (Canon et al., Nature 575(7781):217-223, 2019; 
Hallin et al., Cancer Discov 10(1):54-71, 2020). Despite this success in 
pharmacologically targeting KRAS(G12C), the remaining RAS mutants lack readily 
tractable chemistries for development of covalent inhibitors. Thus, alternative 
approaches are needed to develop broadly efficacious RAS inhibitors. We have 
utilized Monobody (Mb) technology to identify vulnerabilities in RAS that can 
potentially be exploited for development of novel RAS inhibitors. Here, we 
describe the methods used to isolate RAS-specific Mbs and to define their 
inhibitory activity.
