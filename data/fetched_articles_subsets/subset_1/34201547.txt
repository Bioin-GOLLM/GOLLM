Gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) is a common tumor with high morbidity and mortality. 
Only 7% of patients with GC are diagnosed before age 50 (early onset gastric 
cancer (EOGC)), and their characteristics have been poorly described. We aimed 
to describe clinical, molecular, and genetic characteristics of EOGC. A total of 
309 patients with EOGC were retrospectively studied in four Spanish centers. 
Personal information, family history, and tumor information were registered. 
Germinal genetic analysis was performed in patients who met current criteria of 
a hereditary syndrome at the time of diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis was 
44 years. The majority (73.3%) of tumors were diffuse, and 78.3% were diagnosed 
in an advanced stage. Familial aggregation of GC was present in 18/117 (15.4%) 
cases, and 5/117 (4.3%) met criteria for familial GC. MMR-IHC was performed in 
126/309 (40.7%) tumors: 4/126 (3.1%) had loss of expression in MLH1/PMS2, 
without an associated germline mutation. Sixteen germline genetic analyses were 
performed, detecting a pathogenic variant in four (25%) cases: one in BRCA2, one 
in TP53, and two in CDH1. Most EOGC are diffuse and diagnosed in an advanced 
stage. In these patients, DNA MMR system deficiency is uncommon. Although 
familial aggregation was observed in only 15% of cases, a germline mutation was 
found in 25% of patients tested with clinical criteria. This demonstrates that 
EOGC has a marked genetic heterogeneity, reinforcing the importance of an 
accurate genetic counseling and enhancing the emerging use of multigene panels.
