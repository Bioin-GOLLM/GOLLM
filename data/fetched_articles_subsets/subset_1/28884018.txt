Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major Ser/Thr phosphatase; it forms diverse 
heterotrimeric holoenzymes that counteract kinase actions. Using a peptidome 
that tiles the disordered regions of the human proteome, we identified proteins 
containing [LMFI]xx[ILV]xEx motifs that serve as interaction sites for B'-family 
PP2A regulatory subunits and holoenzymes. The B'-binding motifs have important 
roles in substrate recognition and in competitive inhibition of substrate 
binding. With more than 100 novel ligands identified, we confirmed that the 
recently identified LxxIxEx B'Î±-binding motifs serve as common binding sites for 
B' subunits with minor variations, and that S/T phosphorylation or D/E residues 
at positions 2, 7, 8 and 9 of the motifs reinforce interactions. Hundreds of 
proteins in the human proteome harbor intrinsic or phosphorylation-responsive 
B'-interaction motifs, and localize at distinct cellular organelles, such as 
midbody, predicting kinase-facilitated recruitment of PP2A-B' holoenzymes for 
tight spatiotemporal control of phosphorylation at mitosis and cytokinesis. 
Moroever, Polo-like kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation of Cyk4/RACGAP1, a 
centralspindlin component at the midbody, facilitates binding of both RhoA 
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 
(Ect2)) and PP2A-B' that in turn dephosphorylates Cyk4 and disrupts Ect2 
binding. This feedback signaling loop precisely controls RhoA activation and 
specifies a restricted region for cleavage furrow ingression. Our results 
provide a framework for further investigation of diverse signaling circuits 
formed by PP2A-B' holoenzymes in various cellular processes.
