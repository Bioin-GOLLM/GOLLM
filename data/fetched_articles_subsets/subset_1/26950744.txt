A limiting factor in membrane protein research is the ability to solubilize and 
stabilize such proteins. Detergents are used most often for solubilizing 
membrane proteins, but they are associated with protein instability and poor 
compatibility with structural and biophysical studies. Here we present a 
saposin-lipoprotein nanoparticle system, Salipro, which allows for the 
reconstitution of membrane proteins in a lipid environment that is stabilized by 
a scaffold of saposin proteins. We demonstrate the applicability of the method 
on two purified membrane protein complexes as well as by the direct 
solubilization and nanoparticle incorporation of a viral membrane protein 
complex from the virus membrane. Our approach facilitated high-resolution 
structural studies of the bacterial peptide transporter PeptTSo2 by 
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and allowed us to stabilize 
the HIV envelope glycoprotein in a functional state.
