Unspliced, genomic HIV-1 RNA (vRNA) is a component of several ribonucleoprotein 
complexes (RNP) during the viral replication cycle. In earlier work, we 
demonstrated that the host upframeshift protein 1 (UPF1), a key factor in 
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), colocalized and associated to the viral 
structural protein Gag during viral egress. In this work, we demonstrate a new 
function for UPF1 in the regulation of vRNA nuclear export. OPEN ACCESS 
Biomolecules 2015, 5 2809 We establish that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of 
UPF1 is required for this function and demonstrate that UPF1 exists in two 
essential viral RNPs during the late phase of HIV-1 replication: the first, in a 
nuclear export RNP that contains Rev, CRM1, DDX3 and the nucleoporin p62, and 
the second, which excludes these nuclear export markers but contains Gag in the 
cytoplasm. Interestingly, we observed that both UPF2 and the long isoform of 
UPF3a, UPF3aL, but not the shorter isoforms UPF3aS and UPF3b, are excluded from 
the UPF1-Rev-CRM1-DDX3 complex as they are negative regulators of vRNA nuclear 
export. In silico protein-protein docking analyses suggest that Rev binds UPF1 
in a region that overlaps the UPF2 binding site, thus explaining the exclusion 
of this negative regulatory factor by HIV-1 that is necessary for vRNA 
trafficking. This work uncovers a novel and unique regulatory circuit involving 
several UPF proteins that ultimately regulate vRNA nuclear export and 
trafficking.
