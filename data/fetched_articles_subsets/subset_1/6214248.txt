In vitro replication of mutagen-damaged DNA: sites of termination.

Moore PD, Rabkin SD, Strauss BS.

We have examined the effect of DNA lesions, which in vivo are potentially 
mutagenic, on in vitro DNA synthesis carried out by a number of purified DNA 
polymerases using a 0X174 template. Both acetyl aminofluorene (AAF) adducts and 
UV-induced pyrimidine dimers are blocks to elongation by DNA polymerases. On 
UV-irradiated DNA templates synthesis terminates one nucleotide before the sites 
of pyrimidine dimers with all of the enzymes tested: Pol I and Pol III 
holoenzyme from Escherichia coli, T4 DNA polymerase, avian myeloblastosis virus 
reverse transcriptase and a mammalian DNA polymerase alpha. With AAF, which 
reacts at the C-8 position of guanine, differences are observed between the 
above enzymes, with the latter two inserting a nucleotide opposite the site of 
the lesion. Substitution of Mn2+ for Mg2+ as the cation in the Pol I reactions 
causes changes in the termination pattern on both UV-irradiated and AAF-reacted 
templates. The significance of these results to the process of inducible 
error-prone repair and the possible bypass of lesions in the DNA is discussed.
