Background: Azo compounds, containing naphthol and diazonium salts, are 
synthetic dyes widely used in the batik industry. Azo compounds are considered 
toxic when they are exposed to human tissue. The purpose of this study was to 
analyze buccal cell DNA exposed to azo compounds in batik workers. Methods: A 
cross-sectional study involving 20 male subjects divided into two groups (n=10 
group), namely azo-exposed and non-exposed (control group). Inclusion criteria 
were batik workers of the colouring division who have been exposed to azo for at 
least 5 years. Buccal cells were taken using cytobrush then DNA were isolated 
from buccal cell. DNA isolation was done by buccal DNA kit, while the purity and 
concentration of the DNA was determined using spectrophotometer and 
electrophoresis. Results: The azo-exposed group revealed higher purity DNA than 
those in the control group. The purity of the DNA in the azo-exposed group and 
control group was 0.61±0.93 and 0.21±0.09, respectively, while the concentration 
of DNA was of 59.02 and 19.35 ng/UL, respectively. The ratio at 260/280 nm was 
1.84-1.94 (azo-exposed) and 1.85-1.92 (control). Principal component analysis 
using the first principle component (PC1) and second principle component (PC2) 
could successfully classify subjects in the control and azo-exposed groups. 
Conclusion: Characteristics of DNA could be used as an indication of exposure to 
azo compounds in workers of batik industries.
