We have produced recombinant hemoglobins (rHbs) alpha 2 beta 2(6Glu-->Lys) (rHb 
beta E6K) and alpha 2 beta 2(6Glu-->Arg) (rHb beta E6R) using a yeast expression 
system coupled with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis strategy 
for studies focused on defining determinants that facilitate crystallization of 
Hb C (alpha 2 beta 2(6Lys)). rHb beta E6K had the same electrophoretic mobility 
as native human Hb C, whereas rHb beta E6R migrated slightly slower than Hb C on 
cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The carbonmonoxy (CO) forms of rHb beta E6K 
and rHb beta E6R formed tetrahedral crystals in vitro in 2.3 mol/L phosphate 
buffer just like native Hb C. The Hb concentration required for crystallization 
of CO-rHb beta E6R was lower than that of CO-rHb beta E6K, suggesting that 
stronger basic amino acids at the beta 6 position accelerate crystallization of 
Hb. However, the size of rHb beta E6R crystals was smaller than that of rHb beta 
E6K. Crystallization of native Hb C and both rHbs was inhibited by Hb F. These 
results suggest that alpha 2 beta gamma-heterohybrids that have basic amino 
acids at the beta 6 position behave similarly and are unable to crystallize like 
Hb C.
