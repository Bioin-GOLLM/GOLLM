BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Essential Hypertension (EH) is a common disorder 
associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in Malaysia. To 
investigate how genetic polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system (RAS) influence EH control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
drugs (ACEI).
METHODS: A case-control, cross-sectional population-based nested study (n = 142) 
included hypertensive subjects treated with ACEI drugs, either lisinopril or 
enalapril (20 mg, once daily) as monotherapy for 24 weeks. In total seven 
possible polymorphisms of RAS genes were genotyped. The association between 
those polymorphisms and the changes in blood pressure were observed in the 
24 week treatment.
RESULTS: Statistically significant associations of I, G, T, M and G alleles of 
ACE (I/D, G2350A), AGT (M235T, T175M and G-6A) respectively were observed in 
essential hypertensive subjects. The decrease in systolic blood pressure and 
diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment of the patients carrying 
II, GG, and TT genotypes were greater than the groups carrying DD, AA, MM, MM 
and GG of I/D, G2350A, M235T, T174M and G-6A genotypes respectively. In 
contrast, No significant difference was observed between renin gene 
polymorphisms (Bg/I and MboI) and hypertensives.
CONCLUSIONS: Although this study shows a possible association of polymorphisms 
of RAS genes with the risk of non-control of HT in ACEI-treated patients and 
indicates the importance of all this system's components in regulating HT, it 
needs to be replicated in other data sources.
