BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a heritable bone fragility disorder, 
is mainly caused by mutations in COL1A1 gene encoding α1 chain of type I 
collagen. This study aimed to investigate the COL1A1 mutation spectrum and 
quantitatively assess the genotype-phenotype relationship in a large cohort of 
Chinese patients with OI.
METHODS: A total of 161 patients who were diagnosed as OI in Department of 
Endocrinology of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2010 to 
December 2017 were included in the study. The COL1A1 mutation spectrum was 
identified by next generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. A 
new clinical scoring system was developed to quantitatively assess the clinical 
severity of OI and the genotype-phenotype relationship was analyzed. The 
independent sample t-test, analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U-test, 
Chi-squared test, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression were 
applied for statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Among 161 patients with OI, 32.9% missense mutations, 16.8% non-sense 
mutations, 24.2% splice-site mutations, 24.8% frameshift mutations, and 1.2% 
whole-gene deletions were identified, of which 38 variations were novel. These 
mutations led to 53 patients carrying qualitative defects and 67 patients 
carrying quantitative defects in type I collagen. Compared to patients with 
quantitative mutations, patients with qualitative mutations had lower alkaline 
phosphatase level (296 [132, 346] U/L vs. 218 [136, 284] U/L, P = 0.009) and 
higher clinical score (12.2 ± 5.3 vs. 7.4 ± 2.4, P < 0.001), denoting more 
severe phenotypes including shorter stature, lower bone mineral density, higher 
fracture frequency, more bone deformity, vertebral compressive fractures, 
limited movement, and dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI). Patients would not present 
with DI if the glycine substitutions happened before the 79th amino acid in 
triple helix of α1 chains.
CONCLUSIONS: This presented distinctive COL1A1 mutation spectrum in a large 
cohort of Chinese patients with OI. This new quantitative analysis of 
genotype-phenotype correlation would be helpful to predict the prognosis of OI 
and genetic counseling.
