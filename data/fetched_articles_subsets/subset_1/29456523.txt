G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) exert their physiological function by 
transducing a complex signaling network that coordinates gene expression and 
dictates the phenotype of highly differentiated cells. Much is known about the 
gene networks they transcriptionally regulate upon ligand exposure in a process 
that takes hours before a new protein is synthesized. However, far less is known 
about GPCR impact on the translational machinery and subsequent mRNA 
translation, although this gene regulation level alters the cell phenotype in a 
strikingly different timescale. In fact, mRNA translation is an early response 
kinetically connected to signaling events, hence it leads to the synthesis of a 
new protein within minutes following receptor activation. By these means, mRNA 
translation is responsive to subtle variations of the extracellular environment. 
In addition, when restricted to cell subcellular compartments, local mRNA 
translation contributes to cell micro-specialization, as observed in synaptic 
plasticity or in cell migration. The mechanisms that control where in the cell 
an mRNA is translated are starting to be deciphered. But how an extracellular 
signal triggers such local translation still deserves extensive investigations. 
With the advent of high-throughput data acquisition, it now becomes possible to 
review the current knowledge on the translatome that some GPCRs regulate, and 
how this information can be used to explore GPCR-controlled local translation of 
mRNAs.
