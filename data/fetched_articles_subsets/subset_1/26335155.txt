ALG1-CDG (formerly CDG-Ik) is a subtype of congenital disorders of glycosylation 
(CDG) where the genetic defect disrupts the synthesis of the lipid-linked 
oligosaccharide precursor required for N-glycosylation. The initial step in the 
investigation for these disorders involves the demonstration of hypoglycosylated 
serum transferrin (TF). There are no specific biomarkers of this CDG subtype 
known to date. An LC/MS approach was used to analyze sera from patients with 
ALG1-CDG, PMM2-CDG, suspected CDG, and individuals with alcohol abuse. We show 
mass spectrometric data combined with data from enzymatic digestions that 
suggest the presence of a tetrasaccharide consisting of two 
N-acetylglucosamines, one galactose, and one sialic acid, appearing on serum TF, 
is a biomarker of this particular CDG subtype. This is the first time analysis 
of serum TF can suggest a specific CDG type I subtype and we suggest this 
tetrasaccharide be used in the clinic to guide the ALG1-CDG diagnostic process.
