The global burden of mortality and morbidity caused by traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) is significant, and the heterogeneity of TBI patients and the relatively 
small sample sizes of most current neuroimaging studies is a major challenge for 
scientific advances and clinical translation. The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging 
Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Adult moderate/severe TBI (AMS-TBI) working 
group aims to be a driving force for new discoveries in AMS-TBI by providing 
researchers world-wide with an effective framework and platform for large-scale 
cross-border collaboration and data sharing. Based on the principles of 
transparency, rigor, reproducibility and collaboration, we will facilitate the 
development and dissemination of multiscale and big data analysis pipelines for 
harmonized analyses in AMS-TBI using structural and functional neuroimaging in 
combination with non-imaging biomarkers, genetics, as well as clinical and 
behavioral measures. Ultimately, we will offer investigators an unprecedented 
opportunity to test important hypotheses about recovery and morbidity in AMS-TBI 
by taking advantage of our robust methods for large-scale neuroimaging data 
analysis. In this consensus statement we outline the working group's short-term, 
intermediate, and long-term goals.
