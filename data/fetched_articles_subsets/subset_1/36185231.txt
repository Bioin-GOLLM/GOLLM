Hereditary myeloid malignancies, especially in adults or elderly persons, had 
been considered quite rare before the next-generation sequencing era; however, 
increased usage of clinical sequencing has revealed much higher prevalence of 
inherited myeloid malignancies. DDX41 and various pathogenic germline mutations 
have newly been recognized as the cause of adult-onset familial leukemia and 
myeloid malignancies. Although germline predisposition to myeloid neoplasms had 
been categorized as a provisional entity in the World Health Organization 
classification of hematopoietic neoplasms in 2016, methodology for the 
identification of hereditary myeloid malignancies has not been fully established 
yet. In addition, many unresolved problems, such as epidemiology, the exact 
pathogenic mechanisms, and ideal treatment strategy, including indications of 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, still remain. Related donor 
selection for stem cell transplant is a particularly sensitive issue due to the 
possibility of germline mutation of the candidate relatives and the risk of 
donor cell leukemia after transplantation. Here, we reviewed the current 
evidence regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, mechanisms of progression, and 
transplantation strategy for hereditary myeloid malignancies.
