The intestinal mucosa provides a selective barrier between the anaerobic lumen 
and a highly metabolic lamina propria. A number of recent studies indicate that 
acute inflammation of the mucosa can result in tissue hypoxia and associated 
shifts in tissue metabolism. The activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 
under these conditions has been demonstrated to function as an endogenous 
molecular cue to promote resolution of inflammation, particularly through the 
orchestration of barrier repair toward homeostasis. Given the central role of 
oxygen in tissue metabolism, ongoing studies have defined metabolic endpoints of 
HIF stabilization as important biomarkers of disease activity. Such findings 
make HIF and HIF-associated metabolic pathways particularly attractive 
therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we review the 
recent literature related to tissue metabolism in IBD.
