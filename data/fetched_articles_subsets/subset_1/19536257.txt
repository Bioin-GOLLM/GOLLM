Several hundred malaria parasite proteins are exported beyond an encasing 
vacuole and into the cytosol of the host erythrocyte, a process that is central 
to the virulence and viability of the causative Plasmodium species. The 
trafficking machinery responsible for this export is unknown. Here we identify 
in Plasmodium falciparum a translocon of exported proteins (PTEX), which is 
located in the vacuole membrane. The PTEX complex is ATP-powered, and comprises 
heat shock protein 101 (HSP101; a ClpA/B-like ATPase from the AAA+ superfamily, 
of a type commonly associated with protein translocons), a novel protein termed 
PTEX150 and a known parasite protein, exported protein 2 (EXP2). EXP2 is the 
potential channel, as it is the membrane-associated component of the core PTEX 
complex. Two other proteins, a new protein PTEX88 and thioredoxin 2 (TRX2), were 
also identified as PTEX components. As a common portal for numerous crucial 
processes, this translocon offers a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.
