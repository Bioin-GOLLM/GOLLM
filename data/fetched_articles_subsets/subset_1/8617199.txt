Galanin, a neuroendocrine peptide of 29 amino acids, binds to Gi/Go-coupled 
receptors to trigger cellular responses. To determine which amino acids of the 
recently cloned seven-transmembrane domain-type human galanin receptor are 
involved in the high-affinity binding of the endogenous peptide ligand, we 
performed a mutagenesis study. Mutation of the His264 or His267 of transmembrane 
domain VI to alanine, or of Phe282 of transmembrane domain VII to glycine, 
results in an apparent loss of galanin binding. The substitution of Glu271 to 
serine in the extracellular loop III of the receptor causes a 12-fold loss in 
affinity for galanin. We combined the mutagenesis results with data on the 
pharmacophores (Trp2, Tyr9) of galanin and with molecular modelling of the 
receptor using bacteriorhodopsin as a model. Based on these studies, we propose 
a binding site model for the endogenous peptide ligand in the galanin receptor 
where the N-terminus of galanin hydrogen bonds with Glu271 of the receptor, Trp2 
of galanin interacts with the Zn2+ sensitive pair of His264 and His267 of 
transmembrane domain VI, and Tyr9 of galanin interacts with Phe282 of 
transmembrane domain VII, while the C-terminus of galanin is pointing towards 
the N-terminus of th
