Copper deficiency (CD) is a rare complication of long-term treatment of Wilson's 
disease (WD) and is usually accompanied by high serum zinc levels. A 57-year-old 
woman with WD presented with limb weakness and sensory disturbance due to 
myeloneuropathy and macrocytic anemia after 36 years of treatment. Markedly 
reduced serum free copper values confirmed CD, which was considered to be caused 
by progressive dysphagia and severe diarrhea rather than zinc overdose because 
of the normal serum zinc levels. Discontinuing copper-reducing therapy and 
increasing copper intake improved her symptoms. Physicians should be alert for 
the risk of CD in WD patients, especially those with dysphagia.
