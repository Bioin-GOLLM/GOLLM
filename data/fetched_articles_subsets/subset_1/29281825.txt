Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME) are epileptogenic 
neurodevelopmental malformations caused by mutations in mTOR pathway genes. Deep 
sequencing of these genes in FCD/HME brain tissue identified an etiology in 27 
of 66 cases (41%). Radiographically indistinguishable lesions are caused by 
somatic activating mutations in AKT3, MTOR, and PIK3CA and germline 
loss-of-function mutations in DEPDC5, NPRL2, and TSC1/2, including TSC2 
mutations in isolated HME demonstrating a "two-hit" model. Mutations in the same 
gene cause a disease continuum from FCD to HME to bilateral brain overgrowth, 
reflecting the progenitor cell and developmental time when the mutation 
occurred. Single-cell sequencing demonstrated mTOR activation in neurons in all 
lesions. Conditional Pik3ca activation in the mouse cortex showed that mTOR 
activation in excitatory neurons and glia, but not interneurons, is sufficient 
for abnormal cortical overgrowth. These data suggest that mTOR activation in 
dorsal telencephalic progenitors, in some cases specifically the excitatory 
neuron lineage, causes cortical dysplasia.
