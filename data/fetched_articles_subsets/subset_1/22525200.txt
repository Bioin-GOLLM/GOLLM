OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test whether eight common recently identified 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), strongly associated with blood pressure 
(BP) in the population, also have impact on the degree of BP reduction by 
antihypertensive agents with different mechanisms.
METHODS: In 3863 Swedish hypertensive patients, we related number of unfavorable 
alleles of each SNP (i.e. alleles associated with higher baseline BP) to the 
magnitude of BP reduction during 6 months of monotherapy with either a 
beta-blocker, a thiazide diuretic or diltiazem.
RESULTS: For six SNPs (rs16998073, rs1378942, rs3184504, rs1530440, rs16948048, 
rs17367504) no pharmacogenetic interactions were suggested, whereas two SNPs 
showed nominal evidence of association with treatment response: PLCD3-rs12946454 
associated with more SBP (beta = 1.53 mmHg per unfavorable allele; P = 0.010) 
and DBP (beta = 0.73 mmHg per unfavorable allele; P = 0.014) reduction in 
patients treated with diltiazem, in contrast to those treated with beta-blockers 
or diuretics wherein no treatment response association was found. 
CYP17A1-rs11191548 associated with less DBP reduction (beta = -1.26 mmHg per 
unfavorable allele; P = 0.018) in patients treated with beta-blockers or 
diuretics, whereas there was no treatment response association in 
diltiazem-treated patients. However, if accounting for multiple testing, the 
significant associations for rs12946454 and rs11191548 were attenuated.
CONCLUSION: For a majority of these, eight recently identified BP-associated 
SNPs, there are probably no important pharmacogenetic interactions for BP 
reduction with use of beta-blockers, diuretics or diltiazem. Whether the 
nominally significant associations for rs12946454 and rs11191548 are true 
signals and could be of possible clinical relevance for deciding treatment of 
polygenic essential hypertension should be further tested.
