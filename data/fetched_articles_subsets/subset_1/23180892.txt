We report a dramatically improved total synthesis of two highly selective 
(V600E)BRAF inhibitors, PLX4720 and PLX4032, that leverages microwave-assisted 
organic synthesis (MAOS). Compared with previously reported approaches, our 
novel MAOS method significantly reduces overall reaction time without 
compromising yield. In addition to providing a gram-scale route to these 
compounds for preclinical oncology research, we anticipate this approach could 
accelerate the synthesis of azaindoles in high-throughput, library-based 
formats.
