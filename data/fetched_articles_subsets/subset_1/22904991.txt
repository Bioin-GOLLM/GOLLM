In the title compound, C(15)H(14)O(4)S, the dihedral angle between the benzene 
and phenyl rings is 88.74 (10)°. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked into a 
three-dimensional network by C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking inter-actions 
[centroid-centroid distances = 3.6092 (13)-3.8651 (13) Å].
