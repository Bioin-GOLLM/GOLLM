Demodex mites are commensal parasites of hair follicles (HFs). Normally 
asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune 
dysfunction, and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth are not 
defined. Here, we show that control of mite HF colonization in mice required 
group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), interleukin-13 (IL-13), and its receptor, 
IL-4Ra-IL-13Ra1. HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and 
epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization 
led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for 
repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF 
exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition 
associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 
cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice. Our studies 
uncover a key role for skin ILC2s and IL-13, which comprise an immune checkpoint 
that sustains cutaneous integrity and restricts pathologic infestation by 
colonizing HF mites.
