INTRODUCTION: Recent studies reported that FTO exert its effects on body weight 
through change the expression IRX3. The aim of this study was investigation of 
the possible mechanisms of the effects of IRX3 gene on obesity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present review was carried out using keywords such as 
polymorphism and/or obesity and/or BMI and/or IRX3 gene and/or Iroquois homeobox 
protein 3. Databases including PubMed, Science Direct, web of sciences, Scopus, 
and Cochran databases were used to collect all related articles published from 
2000 to 2019.
RESULTS: Based on this review, there are some evidences on the association 
between the IRX3 polymorphisms and the IRX3 expression level with body weight. 
In some studies, the up-regulation of IRX3 expression was related to increased 
body weight, while in some other studies down-regulation of IRX3 expression was 
related to obesity.
CONCLUSIONS: This review investigated the probable mechanisms of the effects of 
the IRX3 gene on obesity. Studies in this are limited and reported contradictory 
results. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of IRX3 gene in the 
associations between genes, diet, and obesity.
