Ribosome collisions are recognized by E3 ubiquitin ligase Hel2/ZNF598, leading 
to RQC (ribosome-associated quality control) and to endonucleolytic cleavage and 
degradation of the mRNA termed NGD (no-go decay). NGD in yeast requires the Cue2 
endonuclease and occurs in two modes, either coupled to RQC (NGDRQC+) or RQC 
uncoupled (NGDRQC-). This is mediated by an unknown mechanism of substrate 
recognition by Cue2. Here, we show that the ubiquitin binding activity of Cue2 
is required for NGDRQC- but not for NGDRQC+, and that it involves the first two 
N-terminal Cue domains. In contrast, Trp122 of Cue2 is crucial for NGDRQC+. 
Moreover, Mbf1 is required for quality controls by preventing +1 ribosome 
frameshifting induced by a rare codon staller. We propose that in Cue2-dependent 
cleavage upstream of the collided ribosomes (NGDRQC-), polyubiquitination of eS7 
is recognized by two N-terminal Cue domains of Cue2. In contrast, for the 
cleavage within collided ribosomes (NGDRQC+), the UBA domain, Trp122 and the 
interaction between Mbf1 and uS3 are critical.
