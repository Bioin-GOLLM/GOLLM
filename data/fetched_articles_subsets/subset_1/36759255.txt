BACKGROUND: The inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase intracellular signaling 
pathway is susceptible to genetic or epigenetic alterations that may result in 
major neurological illnesses with clinically significant pons and cerebellum 
involvement.
CASE REPORTS: A seven-year-old girl with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, resistant 
myoclonic epilepsy with axial hypotonia, microcephaly, atypical facial 
appearance, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, hyperactive tendon reflexes, spasticity, 
clonus, extensor plantar response, contractures in wrists and ankles and growth 
retardation, whole-exome sequencing was performed and a homozygous 
"NM_001134225.2:c.646C > T, p.(Arg216Ter)" variant was found in the INPP4A gene.
CONCLUSION: INPP4A mutations should be kept in mind in cases with severely 
delayed psychomotor development, progressive microcephaly, resistant myoclonic 
epilepsy, isolated cerebellum, and pons involvement.
