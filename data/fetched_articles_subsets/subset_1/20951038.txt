Hantaviruses use α(v)β(3) integrins on the surface of human host cells as a 
gateway to invasion, hence compounds that target this receptor may be used as 
antiviral agents. To accomplish this aim, new peptidomimetic compounds were 
selected based on similarity to a cyclic peptide known to bind the α(v)β(3) 
receptor. This first round of biological screening identified peptidomimetic 
molecules which were effective hantavirus inhibitors in the low micromolar 
range, two thousand times more potent than the original cyclic peptide. 
Pharmacophore models were built to broaden the structural diversity of the 
second set of compounds screened. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) were 
drawn from the entire dataset. Further characterization by dose-response studies 
revealed that three compounds had potency in the nanomolar range. Selectivity 
assays with a panel of hantaviruses supported the mechanism of inhibition by 
targeting the α(v)β(3) receptor, through the β(3) integrin.
