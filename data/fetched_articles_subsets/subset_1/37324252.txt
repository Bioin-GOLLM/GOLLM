BACKGROUND: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and potentially also 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) inhibits the synthesis of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) in the chief cells of the parathyroid gland. Clinical studies 
showing a negative correlation between (25(OH)D and PTH are in good agreement 
with these findings in basic science studies. However, PTH was measured in these 
studies with the currently clinically used 2nd or 3rd generation intact PTH 
(iPTH) assay systems. iPTH assays cannot distinguish between oxidized forms of 
PTH and non-oxidized PTH. Oxidized forms of PTH are the by far most abundant 
form of PTH in the circulation of patients with impaired kidney function. 
Oxidation of PTH causes a loss of function of PTH. Given that the clinical 
studies done so far were performed with an PTH assay systems that mainly detect 
oxidized forms of PTH, the real relationship between bioactive non-oxidized PTH 
and 25(OH)D as well as 1,25(OH)2D is still unknown.
METHODS: To address this topic, we compared for the first time the relationship 
between 25(OH)D as well as 1,25(OH)2D and iPTH, oxPTH as well as fully bioactive 
n-oxPTH in 531 stable kidney transplant recipients in the central clinical 
laboratories of the Charité. Samples were assessed either directly (iPTH) or 
after oxPTH (n-oxPTH) was removed using a column that used anti-human oxPTH 
monoclonal antibodies, a monoclonal rat/mouse parathyroid hormone antibody (MAB) 
was immobilized onto a column with 500 liters of plasma samples. Spearman 
correlation analysis and Multivariate linear regression were used to evaluate 
the correlations between the variables.
RESULTS: There was an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D and all forms of PTH, 
including oxPTH (iPTH: r=-0.197, p<0.0001; oxPTH: r=-0.203, p<0.0001; n-oxPTH: 
r=-0.146, p=0.001). No significant correlation was observed between 1,25(OH)2D 
and all forms of PTH. Multiple linear regression analysis considering age, PTH 
(iPTH, oxPTH and n-oxPTH), serum calcium, serum phosphor, serum creatinine, 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), albumin, and 
sclerostin as confounding factors confirmed these findings. Subgroup analysis 
showed that our results are not affected by sex and age.
CONCLUSION: In our study, all forms of PTH are inversely correlated with 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). This finding would be in line with an inhibition 
of the synthesis of all forms of PTH (bioactive n-oxPTH and oxidized forms of 
PTH with minor or no bioactivity) in the chief cells of the parathyroid glad.
