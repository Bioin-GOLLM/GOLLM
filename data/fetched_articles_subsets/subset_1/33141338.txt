AIMS: Diabetic microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy and 
neuropathy may occur at hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c) below the 6.5% 
(48 mmol/mol) diagnostic threshold. Our objective was to assess the validity of 
the HbA1c diagnostic cutpoint of 6.5% based upon published evidence of the 
prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy as markers of diabetes.
METHODS: Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and CINAHL from 
1990-March 2019, grey literature sources. Study Selection All studies reported 
after 1990 (to ensure standardized HbA1c values) where HbA1c levels were 
presented in relation to prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy in 
subjects not known to have diabetes. Data Extraction Studies were screened 
independently, data abstracted, and risk of bias appraised. Data Synthesis Data 
were synthesized using HbA1c categories of < 6.0% (< 42 mmol/mol), 6.0-6.4% 
(42-47 mmol/mol) and ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). Random-effects meta-analyses were 
conducted for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy prevalence stratified by 
HbA1c categories. Random-effects multivariable meta-regression was conducted to 
identify predictors of retinopathy prevalence and sources of between-study 
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Pooled mean prevalence was: 4.0%(95% CI: 3.2-5.0%) for retinopathy, 
10.5% (95% CI: 4.0-19.5%) for nephropathy, 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1-4.3%) for 
neuropathy. Mean prevalence when stratified for HbA1c < 6.0%, 6.0-6.4% 
and ≥ 6.5% was: retinopathy: 3.4% (95% CI: 1.8-5.4%), 2.3% (95% CI: 1.6-3.2%) 
and 7.8%(95% CI: 5.7-10.3%); nephropathy: 7.1% (95% CI: 1.7-15.9%), 9.6% (95% 
CI: 0.8-26.4%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 1.0-46.9%); neuropathy: 2.1% (95% CI: 
0.0-6.8%), 3.4% (95% CI: 0.0-11.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.0-12.8%). Multivariable 
meta-regression showed HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (OR: 4.05; 95% CI: 1.92-8.57%), age > 55 
(OR: 3.23; 95% CI 1.81-5.77), and African-American race (OR: 10.73; 95% CI: 
4.34-26.55), to be associated with higher retinopathy prevalence. Marked 
heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was found across all meta-analyses 
(Cochran's Q-statistic p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of nephropathy and moderate retinopathy was 
increased in subjects with HbA1c values ≥ 6.5% confirming the high specificity 
of this value for diagnosing T2DM; however, at HbA1c < 6.5% retinopathy 
increased at age > 55 years and, most strikingly, in African-Americans, 
suggesting there may be excess microvascular complication prevalence 
(particularly nephropathy) in individuals below the diabetes diagnostic 
threshold.
