Sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) is death of a child over 1 year of 
age that is unexplained after review of clinical history, circumstances of 
death, and complete autopsy with ancillary testing. Multiple etiologies may 
cause SUDC. SUDC and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) share clinical 
and pathological features, suggesting some similarities in mechanism of death 
and possible abnormalities in hippocampus and cortex. To identify molecular 
signaling pathways, we performed label-free quantitative mass spectrometry on 
microdissected frontal cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and cornu ammonis 
(CA1-3) in SUDC (n = 19) and pediatric control cases (n = 19) with an explained 
cause of death. At a 5% false discovery rate (FDR), we found differential 
expression of 660 proteins in frontal cortex, 170 in DG, and 57 in CA1-3. 
Pathway analysis of altered proteins identified top signaling pathways 
associated with activated oxidative phosphorylation (p = 6.3 × 10-15, z = 4.08) 
and inhibited EIF2 signaling (p = 2.0 × 10-21, z = - 2.56) in frontal cortex, 
and activated acute phase response in DG (p = 8.5 × 10-6, z = 2.65) and CA1-3 
(p = 4.7 × 10-6, z = 2.00). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) 
of clinical history indicated that SUDC-positive post-mortem virology (n = 4/17) 
had the most significant module in each brain region, with the top most 
significant associated with decreased mRNA metabolic processes (p = 2.8 × 10-5) 
in frontal cortex. Additional modules were associated with clinical history, 
including fever within 24 h of death (top: increased mitochondrial fission in 
DG, p = 1.8 × 10-3) and febrile seizure history (top: decreased small molecule 
metabolic processes in frontal cortex, p = 8.8 × 10-5) in all brain regions, 
neuropathological hippocampal findings in the DG (top: decreased focal adhesion, 
p = 1.9 × 10-3). Overall, cortical and hippocampal protein changes were present 
in SUDC cases and some correlated with clinical features. Our studies support 
that proteomic studies of SUDC cohorts can advance our understanding of the 
pathogenesis of these tragedies and may inform the development of preventive 
strategies.
