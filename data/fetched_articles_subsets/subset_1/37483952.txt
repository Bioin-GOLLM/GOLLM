Degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD) is a normal part of aging. Due to 
the spine's declining function and the development of pain, it may affect one's 
physical health, mental health, and socioeconomic status. Most of the 
intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) therapies today focus on the symptoms of 
low back pain rather than the underlying etiology or mechanical function of the 
disc. The deteriorated disc is typically not restored by conservative or 
surgical therapies that largely focus on correcting symptoms and structural 
abnormalities. To enhance the clinical outcome and the quality of life of a 
patient, several therapeutic modalities have been created. In this review, we 
discuss genetic and environmental causes of IVDD and describe promising modern 
endogenous and exogenous therapeutic approaches including their applicability 
and relevance to the degeneration process.
