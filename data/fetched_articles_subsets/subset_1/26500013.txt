Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is crucial for preserving normal brain function, 
but how it is regulated by niche cells is uncertain. Here we show that 
β-arrestin 1 (β-arr1) in dentate gyrus (DG) regulates neural precursor 
proliferation. β-arr1 knockout (KO) mice show reduced neural precursor 
proliferation in subgranular zone (SGZ) which could be rescued by selective 
viral expression of β-arr1 but not its nuclear-function-deficient mutants under 
control of hGFAP promotor in DG. Compared with wild type astrocytes, β-arr1 KO 
astrocytes nurture less neurospheres, and this may be attributed to changed 
activity of soluble, heat-sensitive excretive factors, such as BMP2. 
RNA-sequencing reveals that β-arr1 KO DG astrocytes exhibit an aberrant gene 
expression profile of niche factors, including elevated transcription of Bmp2. 
Taken together, our data suggest that β-arr1 mediated nuclear signaling 
regulates the production of excretive factors derived from niche astrocytes and 
expansion of neural precursors in DG, thus maintaining homeostasis of adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis.
