Renal calculus disease is a common cause of renal injury. However, crystal 
nephropathy (uric acid, oxalate, and dihydroxyadenine) can present as chronic 
kidney disease without any evidence of renal stones. If left undiagnosed, there 
is a potential chance of recurrence in the allograft leading to graft failure 
after transplantation. Pretransplant identification and management can avoid 
such complications. Here, we describe a case of APRT deficiency leading to 
crystal nephropathy and end-stage renal failure in a patient who underwent a 
successful kidney transplant.
