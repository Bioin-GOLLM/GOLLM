BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress within the bone marrow niche of multiple myeloma 
contributes to disease progression and drug resistance. Recent studies have 
associated the Hippo pathway with miRNA biogenesis and oxidative stress in solid 
tumors. Oxidative stress and miRNA pathway inter-relates in several cancers. Our 
group recently showed that TAZ functions as a tumor suppressor in MM. However, 
the role of TAZ in oxidative stress in MM is unknown.
AIMS: We sought to examine the role of TAZ in myeloma cells' response to BM 
oxidative stress. We postulated that TAZ might be associated with an oxidative 
stress phenotype and distinct miRNA signature in MM.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using human myeloma cell lines and clinical samples, we 
demonstrate that TAZ promotes myeloma cells' sensitivity to oxidative stress and 
anticancer-induced cytotoxicity by inducing miR-224 to repress the NRF2 
antioxidant program in MM. We show that low expression of TAZ protein confers an 
oxidative stress-resistant phenotype in MM. Furthermore, we provide evidence 
that overexpression of miR-224 in myeloma cells expressing low amounts of TAZ 
protein inhibits cell growth and enhances sensitivity to anti-myeloma 
therapeutics.
CONCLUSION: Our findings uncover a potential role for TAZ in oxidative stress 
response in MM via the miR-224-NRF2 molecular pathway. This provides the 
scientific ground to explore miR-224 as a potential molecular target to modify 
TAZ expression and enhance myeloma sensitivity to treatment.
