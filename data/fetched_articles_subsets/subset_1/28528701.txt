Recent reports have documented the differentiation of human pluripotent stem 
cells toward the skeletal myogenic lineage using transgene- and cell 
purification-free approaches. Although these protocols generate myocytes, they 
have not demonstrated scalability, safety, and in vivo engraftment, which are 
key aspects for their future clinical application. Here we recapitulate one 
prominent protocol, and show that it gives rise to a heterogeneous cell 
population containing myocytes and other cell types. Upon transplantation, the 
majority of human donor cells could not contribute to myofiber formation. As a 
proof-of-principle, we incorporated the inducible PAX7 lentiviral system into 
this protocol, which then enabled scalable expansion of a homogeneous population 
of skeletal myogenic progenitors capable of forming myofibers in vivo. Our 
findings demonstrate the methods for scalable expansion of PAX7+ myogenic 
progenitors and their purification are critical for practical application to 
cell replacement treatment of muscle degenerative diseases.
