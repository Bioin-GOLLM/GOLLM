DNAJC13 mutations have been suggested to cause Parkinson's disease (PD), yet 
subsequent studies reported conflicting results on this association. In the 
present study, we sequenced the coding region of DNAJC13 in a 
French-Canadian/French cohort of 528 PD patients and 692 controls. A total of 62 
(11.7%) carriers of rare DNAJC13 variants were identified among the PD patients 
compared with 82 (11.8%) among controls (p = 1.0). Two variants that were 
previously suggested to be associated with PD, p.R1516H and p.L2170W, were 
identified with similar directions of association as previously reported. The 
p.R1516H was found in 2 (0.4%) patients versus 6 (0.9%, nonsignificant) controls 
and the p.L2170W variant was found in 9 (1.7%) patients and 5 (0.7%, 
nonsignificant) controls. Meta-analysis with previous reports resulted in odds 
ratios of 0.32 (95% confidence interval = 0.15-0.68, p = 0.0037) and 2.68 (95% 
confidence interval = 1.32-5.42, p = 0.007), respectively. Our results provide 
some support for the possibility that specific DNAJC13 variants may play a minor 
role in PD susceptibility, although studies in additional populations are 
necessary.
