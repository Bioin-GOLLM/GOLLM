Despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), neuronal cell 
death remains a problem that is frequently found in the brains of HIV-1-infected 
patients. HAART has successfully prevented many of the former end-stage 
complications of AIDS, however, with increased survival times, the prevalence of 
minor HIV-1 associated cognitive impairment appears to be rising among AIDS 
patients. Further, HIV-1 associated dementia (HAD) is still prevalent in treated 
patients as well as attenuated forms of HAD and CNS opportunistic disorders. 
HIV-associated cognitive impairment correlates with the increased presence in 
the CNS of activated, though not necessarily HIV-1-infected, microglia and CNS 
macrophages. This suggests that indirect mechanisms of neuronal injury and 
loss/death occur in HIV/AIDS as a basis for dementia since neurons are not 
themselves productively infected by HIV-1. In this review, we discussed the 
symptoms and causes leading to HAD. Outcome from this review will provide new 
information regarding mechanisms of neuronal loss in AIDS patients.
