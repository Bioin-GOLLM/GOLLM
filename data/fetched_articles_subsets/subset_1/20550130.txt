Oligomeric assemblies formed from a variety of disease-associated peptides and 
proteins have been strongly associated with toxicity in many neurodegenerative 
conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. The precise nature of the toxic agents, 
however, remains still to be established. We show that prefibrillar aggregates 
of E22G (arctic) variant of the Abeta(1-42) peptide bind strongly to 
1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate and that changes in this property correlate 
significantly with changes in its cytotoxicity. Moreover, we show that this 
phenomenon is common to other amyloid systems, such as wild-type Abeta(1-42), 
the I59T variant of human lysozyme and an SH3 domain. These findings are 
consistent with a model in which the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces as a 
result of the aggregation of misfolded species is a crucial and common feature 
of these pathogenic species.
