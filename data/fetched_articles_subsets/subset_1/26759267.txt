BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is one of the most frequent 
genetic diseases encountered in the Mediterranean region. We aimed to 
investigate the correlation between genetic mutations and the clinical findings 
in 562 patients with FMF.
METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study conducted with patients' 
files between 2006, and 2013, reverse hybridization assay for MEFV gene 
mutations was used and the 12 most frequent mutations were screened. Mutation 
types and clinical findings were compared with variance analysis.
RESULTS: The mean age was 6.9 ± 3.4 years (range, 1.8-11.6 years). The most 
common symptom was fever (97.3%). Thirty-four of the patients (6.04%) were 
admitted with periodic fever only. Of these patients, M694V was the most common 
mutation type (73.5%). The percentage of the patients predominantly presenting 
with recurrent abdominal pain was 77.78% and the most frequent mutations were 
M694V and E148Q. The rate of arthritis and arthralgia was significantly higher 
in patients with M694V and E148Q mutations. Chest pain was reported more often 
in patients homozygous for M694V (61.4%). Pericardial effusion was documented in 
the echocardiography of 10.9% of the 229 children with chest pain. Some patients 
had both FMF and Henoch Schönlein purpura (HSP), and were more likely to harbor 
either homozygote M694V or E148Q mutations. The frequency of episodes was higher 
in patients with homozygous M694V mutations (number of 
attacks = 4.4 ± 1.6/month). Proteinuria was detected in 106 patients of cases 
(29.2%), at an average of 854 ± 145 mg/L. Most of the patients with proteinuria 
and elevated serum amyloid-A had homozygous M694V mutation.
CONCLUSION: The most common mutation in children in Turkey with FMF is the M694V 
mutation. Recurrent abdominal pain, arthritis or arthralgia, chest pain, and 
pericarditis were commonly seen in patients with M694V and E148Q mutations.
