Actin filaments assemble inside the nucleus in response to multiple cellular 
perturbations, including heat shock, protein misfolding, integrin engagement, 
and serum stimulation. We find that DNA damage also generates nuclear actin 
filaments-detectable by phalloidin and live-cell actin probes-with three 
characteristic morphologies: (i) long, nucleoplasmic filaments; (ii) short, 
nucleolus-associated filaments; and (iii) dense, nucleoplasmic clusters. This 
DNA damage-induced nuclear actin assembly requires two biologically and 
physically linked nucleation factors: Formin-2 and Spire-1/Spire-2. Formin-2 
accumulates in the nucleus after DNA damage, and depletion of either Formin-2 or 
actin's nuclear import factor, importin-9, increases the number of DNA 
double-strand breaks (DSBs), linking nuclear actin filaments to efficient DSB 
clearance. Nuclear actin filaments are also required for nuclear oxidation 
induced by acute genotoxic stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown role 
for nuclear actin filaments in DNA repair and identify the molecular mechanisms 
creating these nuclear filaments.
