My underlying diagnosis since birth was congenital muscular dystrophy not 
otherwise specified Being born in 1970 meant that there were no genetic testing, 
no standards of care, and no true understanding of the pathology that separates 
one congenital-onset neuromuscular disorder from the next. Two muscle biopsies 
described histological abnormalities of small type 1 fibers and were among the 
first of M.H. Brooke's cases described as congenital fiber-type disproportion 
(Brooke, Experta Medica 295: 147 [1973]).
