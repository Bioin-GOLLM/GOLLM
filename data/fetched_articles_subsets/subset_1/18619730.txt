Ten non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs), which were recently 
associated with colorectal cancer risk in a comprehensive, array based study 
(AKAP9 M463I, DKK3 G335R, AMPD1 Q12X, LIPC L356F, PSMB9 V32I, THBS1 N700S, CA6 
S90G, ASCC3 C1995S, DHX36 S416C and CPA4 G303C) were re-evaluated in the present 
study based on 626 German familial non-HNPCC colorectal cancer patients and 736 
healthy controls. No associations of any of the 10 nsSNPs with colorectal cancer 
could be replicated. The combined analyses indicated that further research based 
on additional independent samples is required.
