Oocytes mature into eggs by extruding half of their chromosomes in a small cell 
termed the polar body. Asymmetric oocyte division is essential for fertility 
[1], but despite its importance, little is known about its mechanism. In 
mammals, the meiotic spindle initially forms close to the center of the oocyte. 
Thus, two steps are required for asymmetric meiotic division: first, asymmetric 
spindle positioning and second, polar body extrusion. Here, we identify Spire1 
and Spire2 as new key factors in asymmetric division of mouse oocytes. Spire 
proteins are novel types of actin nucleators that drive nucleation of actin 
filaments with their four WH2 actin-binding domains [2-6]. We show that Spire1 
and Spire2 first mediate asymmetric spindle positioning by assembling an actin 
network that serves as a substrate for spindle movement. Second, they drive 
polar body extrusion by promoting assembly of the cleavage furrow. Our data 
suggest that Spire1 and Spire2 cooperate with Formin-2 (Fmn2) to nucleate actin 
filaments in mouse oocytes and that both types of nucleators act as a functional 
unit. This study not only reveals how Spire1 and Spire2 drive two critical steps 
of asymmetric oocyte division, but it also uncovers the first physiological 
function of Spire-type actin nucleators in vertebrates.
