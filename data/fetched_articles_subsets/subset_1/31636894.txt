BACKGROUND: The growth plate is a special region of the cartilage that drives 
longitudinal growth of long bones. Proliferating chondrocytes in the growth 
plate, arranged in columns, divide perpendicular to the long axis of the growth 
plate then intercalate to re-align with parental columns. Which molecular 
partners maintain growth plate columnar structures and chondrocyte cytokinesis 
has not been fully revealed. It is reported that kinesin family member 3A 
(KIF3A), a subunit of kinesin-2, plays an important role in maintaining columnar 
organization in growth plates via controlling primary cilia formation and cell 
proliferation.
RESULT: Here we identify kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B), the heavy chain of 
kinesin-1, a ubiquitously expressed motor protein for anterograde intracellular 
transport along the microtubule network, as a key modulator of cytokinesis in 
chondrocytes via maintenance of central spindle organization. We show that KIF5B 
is concentrated in the central spindle during cytokinesis in both primary 
chondrocytes and chondrogenic ATDC5 cells.
CONCLUSION: The failure of cytokinesis in KIF5B null chondrocytes leads to 
incomplete cell rotation, disrupting proliferation and differentiation, and 
results in a disorganized growth plate.
