Quantitative screening for potential drug-protein binding is an essential step 
in developing novel metal-based anticancer drugs. ICP-MS approaches are at the 
core of this task; however, many applications lack in the capability of 
large-scale high-throughput screenings and proper validation. In this work, we 
critically discuss the analytical figures of merit and the potential 
method-based quantitative differences applying four different ICP-MS strategies 
to ex vivo drug-serum incubations. Two candidate drugs, more specifically, two 
Pt(IV) complexes with known differences of binding affinity towards serum 
proteins were selected. The study integrated centrifugal ultrafiltration 
followed by flow injection analysis, turbulent flow chromatography (TFC), and 
size exclusion chromatography (SEC), all combined with inductively coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As a novelty, for the first time, UHPLC 
SEC-ICP-MS was implemented to enable rapid protein separation to be performed 
within a few minutes at >â€‰90% column recovery for protein adducts and small 
molecules. Graphical abstract Quantitative screening for potential drug-protein 
binding is an essential step in developingnovel metal-based anticancer drugs.
