6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a widely used dopaminergic neurotoxin that leads 
to cell apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, and is a widely accepted experimental 
model of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. However, the molecular 
mechanisms responsible for 6-OHDA-induced cell apoptosis are unclear. We found 
that the treatment of PC12 cells with 6-OHDA resulted in a significant decrease 
in cell viability and elevated apoptosis as detected by MTT assay, Hoechst 33258 
staining, and flow cytometry. In addition, 6-OHDA induced a time-dependent 
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at Thr-202/Tyr-204 and of Raf-1 at Ser-338, but a 
decreased level of Raf-1 phosphorylation at Ser-259. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 
at Thr-202/Tyr-204 and Raf-1 at Ser-338 were inhibited by the Raf-1 inhibitor 
GW5074, while the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor U0126 decreased phosphorylation of 
ERK1/2. Furthermore, 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells apoptosis was suppressed by 
GW5074 and U0126. Our results suggest that GW5074 and U0126 act as neuroprotants 
against 6-OHDA toxicity in PC12 cells by modulating Raf-1/ERK1/2 signaling 
systems.
