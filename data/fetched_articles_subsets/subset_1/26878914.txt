Vibrio cholerae, the etiological agent of cholera, was found to be attracted by 
taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid), a major constituent of human bile. Mlp37, 
the closest homolog of the previously identified amino acid chemoreceptor Mlp24, 
was found to mediate taxis to taurine as well as L-serine, L-alanine, 
L-arginine, and other amino acids. Methylation of Mlp37 was enhanced upon the 
addition of taurine and amino acids. Isothermal titration calorimetry 
demonstrated that a purified periplasmic fragment of Mlp37 binds directly to 
taurine, L-serine, L-alanine and L-arginine. Crystal structures of the 
periplamic domain of Mlp37 revealed that L-serine and taurine bind to the 
membrane-distal PAS domain in essentially in the same way. The structural 
information was supported by characterising the in vivo properties of 
alanine-substituted mutant forms of Mlp37. The fact that the ligand-binding 
domain of the L-serine complex had a small opening, which would accommodate a 
larger R group, accounts for the broad ligand specificity of Mlp37 and allowed 
us to visualise ligand binding to Mlp37 with fluorescently labelled L-serine. 
Taken together, we conclude that Mlp37 serves as the major chemoreceptor for 
taurine and various amino acids.
