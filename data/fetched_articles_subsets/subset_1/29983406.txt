Pilocytic and pilomyxoid astrocytomas are some of the most common gliomas in 
children and young adults. These gliomas are indolent neoplasms with long 
overall survival probability. The genetic characteristics of these neoplasms are 
well known, and our deepened understanding of their associated molecular 
alterations has led to the development of novel treatment strategies and 
approaches. Currently, we can account for some of the unusual behavior, such as 
oncogene-induced senescence, associated spontaneous regression, anaplastic 
transformation, and cerebrospinal dissemination, of these gliomas. Nevertheless, 
enigmatic issues continue to surround these chronic tumors. Here, we review the 
classical and uncommon clinical pathological and genetic features of these 
indolent gliomas.
