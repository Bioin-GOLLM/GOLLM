BACKGROUND: Fluoropyrimidines (FPs) carry around 20% risk of G3-5 toxicity and 
0.2-1% risk of death, due to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. 
Several screening approaches exist for predicting toxicity, however there is 
ongoing debate over which method is best. This study compares 4 screening 
approaches.
METHOD: 472 patients treated for colorectal, head-and-neck, breast, or 
pancreatic cancers, who had not been tested pre-treatment for FP toxicity risk, 
were screened using: DPYD genotyping (G); phenotyping via plasma Uracil (U); 
phenotyping via plasma-dihydrouracil/uracil ratio (UH2/U); and a 
Multi-Parametric Method (MPM) using genotype, phenotype, and epigenetic data. 
Performance was compared, particularly the inability to detect at-risk patients 
(false negatives).
RESULTS: False negative rates for detecting G5 toxicity risk were 51.2%, 19.5%, 
9.8% and 2.4%, for G, U, UH2/U and MPM, respectively. False negative rates for 
detecting G4-5 toxicity risk were 59.8%, 36.1%, 21.3% and 4.7%, respectively. 
MPM demonstrated significantly (p < 0.001) better prediction performance.
CONCLUSION: MPM is the most effective method for limiting G4-5 toxicity. Its 
systematic implementation is cost-effective and significantly improves the 
risk-benefit ratio of FP-treatment. The use of MPM, rather than G or U testing, 
would avoid nearly 8,000 FP-related deaths per year globally (500 in France), 
and spare hundreds of thousands from G4 toxicity.
