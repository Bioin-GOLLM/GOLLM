BACKGROUND: Both familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) result in 
progressive cortical and subcortical atrophy. Familial autosomal dominant AD 
(FAD) allows us to study AD brain changes presymptomatically.
METHODS: 33 subjects at risk for FAD (25 for PSEN1 and 8 for APP mutations; 22 
mutation carriers and 11 controls) and 3 demented PSEN1 mutation carriers 
underwent T(1)-weighted MPRAGE 1.5T MRI. Using the hippocampal radial distance 
and cortical pattern matching techniques, we investigated the effects of carrier 
status and dementia diagnosis on cortical and hippocampal atrophy. All analyses 
were corrected for age and relative age (years to median age of disease onset in 
the family).
RESULTS: The dementia cases had pronounced cortical atrophy in the lateral and 
medial parietal, posterior cingulate and frontal cortices and hippocampal 
atrophy bilaterally relative to both nondemented carriers and controls. 
Nondemented carriers did not show significant cortical thinning or hippocampal 
atrophy relative to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: FAD is associated with thinning of the posterior association and 
frontal cortices and hippocampal atrophy. Larger sample sizes may be necessary 
to reliably identify cortical atrophy in presymptomatic carriers.
