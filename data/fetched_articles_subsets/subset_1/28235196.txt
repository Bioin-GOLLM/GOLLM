The molecular basis of the incomplete penetrance of monogenic disorders is 
unclear. We describe here eight related individuals with autosomal recessive 
TIRAP deficiency. Life-threatening staphylococcal disease occurred during 
childhood in the proband, but not in the other seven homozygotes. Responses to 
all Toll-like receptor 1/2 (TLR1/2), TLR2/6, and TLR4 agonists were impaired in 
the fibroblasts and leukocytes of all TIRAP-deficient individuals. However, the 
whole-blood response to the TLR2/6 agonist staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid 
(LTA) was abolished only in the index case individual, the only family member 
lacking LTA-specific antibodies (Abs). This defective response was reversed in 
the patient, but not in interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 
(IRAK-4)-deficient individuals, by anti-LTA monoclonal antibody (mAb). Anti-LTA 
mAb also rescued the macrophage response in mice lacking TIRAP, but not TLR2 or 
MyD88. Thus, acquired anti-LTA Abs rescue TLR2-dependent immunity to 
staphylococcal LTA in individuals with inherited TIRAP deficiency, accounting 
for incomplete penetrance. Combined TIRAP and anti-LTA Ab deficiencies underlie 
staphylococcal disease in this patient.
