Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy allows 
for the real-time visualization of macromolecular dynamics and complex assembly. 
Prism-based TIRF microscopes (prismTIRF) are relatively simple to operate and 
can be easily modulated to fit the needs of a wide variety of experimental 
applications. While building a prismTIRF microscope without expert assistance 
can pose a significant challenge, the components needed to build a prismTIRF 
microscope are relatively affordable and, with some guidance, the assembly can 
be completed by a determined novice. Here, we provide an easy-to-follow guide 
for the design, assembly, and operation of a three-color prismTIRF microscope 
which can be utilized for the study of macromolecular complexes, including the 
multi-component protein-DNA complexes responsible for DNA repair, replication, 
and transcription. Our hope is that this article can assist laboratories that 
aspire to implement single-molecule TIRF techniques, and consequently expand the 
application of this technology.
