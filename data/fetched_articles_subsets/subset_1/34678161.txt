The integration of genomic data into health systems offers opportunities to 
identify genomic factors underlying the continuum of rare and common disease. We 
applied a population-scale haplotype association approach based on 
identity-by-descent (IBD) in a large multi-ethnic biobank to a spectrum of 
disease outcomes derived from electronic health records (EHRs) and uncovered a 
risk locus for liver disease. We used genome sequencing and in silico approaches 
to fine-map the signal to a non-coding variant (c.2784-12T>C) in the gene ABCB4. 
In vitro analysis confirmed the variant disrupted splicing of the ABCB4 
pre-mRNA. Four of five homozygotes had evidence of advanced liver disease, and 
there was a significant association with liver disease among heterozygotes, 
suggesting the variant is linked to increased risk of liver disease in an allele 
dose-dependent manner. Population-level screening revealed the variant to be at 
a carrier rate of 1.95% in Puerto Rican individuals, likely as the result of a 
Puerto Rican founder effect. This work demonstrates that integrating EHR and 
genomic data at a population scale can facilitate strategies for understanding 
the continuum of genomic risk for common diseases, particularly in populations 
underrepresented in genomic medicine.
