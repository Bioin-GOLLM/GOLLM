AIMS: The objective of this study was to determine the association of TNF-α -308 
G/A, IFN-γ +874 T/A, IL-12B + 1188 A/C, IL-10 -1082 G/A and IL-4 -590 C/T 
polymorphisms with susceptibility to CL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 55 CL patients and 110 controls from Sanlıurfa 
province of Turkey were included to this study. Polymorphisms were genotyped by 
'polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)' 
and 'amplification refractory mutation system-PCR (ARMS-PCR)' methods. A 
statistically significant difference was noted in the allele (P < .001, 
P = .002) and genotype (P < .001, P = .001,) frequencies of TNF-α -308 G/A and 
IL-4 -590 C/T, respectively. TNF-α 308 GG versus GA genotype (OR = 19.556 [95% 
CI 8.310-46.019] P < .001), GG versus GA + AA genotype (OR = 20.444 [95% CI 
8.707-48.004] P < .001) and G versus A allele (OR = 6.968 [95% CI 3.903-12.440] 
P < .001) revealed significant association with CL. IL-4 -590 CC versus TT + CT 
genotype (OR = 2.049 [95% CI 1.025-4.096], P = .041) and C versus T allele 
(OR = 2.441 [95% CI 1.355-4.396], P = .002) revealed significant association 
with CL.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that TNF-α 308 G/A and IL-4-590 C/T 
polymorphisms are significantly associated with susceptibility to CL. 
Individuals carrying A allele at TNF-α promoter -308 position and T allele at 
IL-4 promoter -590 position are at a higher risk for CL.
