Radial glia-like (RGL) stem cells persist in the adult mammalian hippocampus, 
where they generate new neurons and astrocytes throughout life. The process of 
adult neurogenesis is well documented, but cell-autonomous factors regulating 
neuronal and astroglial differentiation are incompletely understood. Here, we 
evaluate the functions of the transcription factor zinc-finger E-box binding 
homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in adult hippocampal RGL cells using a conditional-inducible 
mouse model. We find that ZEB1 is necessary for self-renewal of active RGL 
cells. Genetic deletion of Zeb1 causes a shift toward symmetric cell division 
that consumes the RGL cell and generates pro-neuronal progenies, resulting in an 
increase of newborn neurons and a decrease of newly generated astrocytes. We 
identify ZEB1 as positive regulator of the ets-domain transcription factor ETV5 
that is critical for asymmetric division.
