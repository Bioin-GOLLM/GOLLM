Three betacoronaviruses have crossed the species barrier and established 
human-to-human transmission causing significant morbidity and mortality in the 
past 20 years. The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The 
identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests 
that additional outbreaks could occur. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved 
neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and 
therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing 
pan-CoV protection. We previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, 
CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta 
variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes 
SARS-CoV-1 and binds to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains 
of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of 
CV3-25 is maintained against the Alpha, Delta, Gamma and Omicron variants of 
concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by 
binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region. Negative stain 
electron microscopy and a 1.74 Å crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex 
demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary 
to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs.
