BACKGROUND: Transport protein particle (TRAPP) is a multiprotein complex 
involved in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking. Zebrafish with a 
mutation in the TRAPPC11 orthologue showed hepatomegaly with steatosis and 
defects in visual system development. In humans, TRAPPC11 mutations have been 
reported in only three families showing limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) or 
myopathy with movement disorders and intellectual disability.
METHODS: We screened muscular dystrophy genes using next-generation sequencing 
and performed associated molecular and biochemical analyses in a patient with 
fatty liver and cataract in addition to infantile-onset muscle weakness.
RESULTS: We identified the first Asian patient with TRAPPC11 mutations. Muscle 
pathology demonstrated typical dystrophic changes and liver biopsy revealed 
steatosis. The patient carried compound heterozygous mutations of a previously 
reported missense and a novel splice-site mutation. The splice-site change 
produced two aberrantly-spliced transcripts that were both predicted to result 
in translational frameshift and truncated proteins. Full-length TRAPPC11 protein 
was undetectable on immunoblotting.
CONCLUSION: This report widens the phenotype of TRAPPC11-opathy as the patient 
showed the following: (1) congenital muscular dystrophy phenotype rather than 
LGMD; (2) steatosis and infantile-onset cataract, both not observed in 
previously reported patients; but (3) no ataxia or abnormal movement, clearly 
indicating that TRAPPC11 plays a physiological role in multiple tissues in 
human.
