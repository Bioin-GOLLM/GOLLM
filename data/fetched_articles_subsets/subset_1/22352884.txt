Human frataxin (FXN) has been intensively studied since the discovery that the 
FXN gene is associated with the neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia. 
Human FXN is a component of the NFS1-ISD11-ISCU2-FXN (SDUF) core Fe-S assembly 
complex and activates the cysteine desulfurase and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis 
reactions. In contrast, the Escherichia coli FXN homologue CyaY inhibits Fe-S 
cluster biosynthesis. To resolve this discrepancy, enzyme kinetic experiments 
were performed for the human and E. coli systems in which analogous cysteine 
desulfurase, Fe-S assembly scaffold, and frataxin components were interchanged. 
Surprisingly, our results reveal that activation or inhibition by the frataxin 
homologue is determined by which cysteine desulfurase is present and not by the 
identity of the frataxin homologue. These data are consistent with a model in 
which the frataxin-less Fe-S assembly complex exists as a mixture of functional 
and nonfunctional states, which are stabilized by binding of frataxin 
homologues. Intriguingly, this appears to be an unusual example in which 
modifications to an enzyme during evolution inverts or reverses the mode of 
control imparted by a regulatory molecule.
