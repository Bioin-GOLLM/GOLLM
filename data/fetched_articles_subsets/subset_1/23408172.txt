Important thermodynamic parameters including denaturant equilibrium m values 
(m(eq)) and heat capacity changes (ΔCp) can be predicted based on changes in 
Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) upon unfolding. Crosslinks such as 
disulfide bonds influence the stability of the proteins by decreasing the 
entropy gain as well as reduction of SASA of unfolded state. The aim of the 
study was to develop mathematical models to predict the effect of crosslinks on 
ΔSASA and ultimately on m(eq) and ΔCp based on in silico methods. Changes of 
SASA upon computationally simulated unfolding were calculated for a set of 45 
proteins with known m(eq) and ΔCp values and the effect of crosslinks on ΔSASA 
of unfolding was investigated. The results were used to predict the m(eq) of 
denaturation for guanidine hydrochloride and urea, as well as ΔCp for the 
studied proteins with overall error of 20%, 31% and 17%, respectively. The 
results of the current study were in close agreement with those obtained from 
the previous studies.
