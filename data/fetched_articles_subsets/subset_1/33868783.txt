Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy in the adolescent 
population. MAFG (v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog 
G) forms a heterodimer with Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), binding to 
antioxidant response element (ARE), which is required for Nrf2 signaling 
activation. We found that MAFG mRNA and protein expression is significantly 
elevated in human OS tissues as well as in established and primary human OS 
cells. In human OS cells, MAGF silencing or knockout (KO) largely inhibited OS 
cell growth, proliferation, and migration, simultaneously inducing oxidative 
injury and apoptosis activation. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MAFG 
augmented OS cell progression in vitro. MicroRNA-4660 (miR-4660) directly binds 
the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of MAFG mRNA in the cytoplasm of OS cells. MAFG 
3' UTR luciferase activity and expression as well as OS cell growth were largely 
inhibited with forced miR-4660 overexpression but augmented with miR-4660 
inhibition. In vivo, MAGF short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or forced overexpression of 
miR-4660 inhibited subcutaneous OS xenograft growth in severe combined 
immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, MAFG silencing or miR-4660 overexpression 
inhibited OS xenograft in situ growth in proximal tibia of the nude mice. In 
summary, MAFG overexpression-driven OS cell progression is inhibited by 
miR-4660. The miR-4660-MAFG axis could be novel therapeutic target for human OS.
