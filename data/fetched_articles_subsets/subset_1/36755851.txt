Leptoporus is a rare and remarkable genus, mainly occurring in coniferous 
forests in the Northern Hemisphere. Recent phylogenetic studies showed that 
Leptoporus belongs to Irpicaceae in the phlebioid clade. It is worth noting that 
most species in the phlebioid clade can cause white-rot decay, except for the 
Leptoporus species, which can cause a brown-rot decay. In this study, we 
performed phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of Leptoporus and related genera. 
Molecular phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on sequences from multiple 
loci including the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, the large subunit 
of nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (nLSU), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II 
gene (RPB1), the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II gene (RPB2), and 
the translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF1). Combined with morphological 
characteristics, a new species, Leptoporus submollis sp. nov., is discovered and 
illustrated from Southwest China.
