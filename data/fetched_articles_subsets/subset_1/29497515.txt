Chronic renal failure is a well-known complication of long-standing diabetes. 
Moreover, audiological abnormalities are a common feature of patients with 
end-stage renal disease. Severe deafness, however, is not a typical symptom in 
most patients with chronic renal failure and likewise in patients with diabetes 
mellitus. In this case report, we describe a young patient with 
insulin-dependant diabetes mellitus, severe deafness requiring hearing aid and 
chronic renal failure outlining typical clinical features of the maternally 
inherited diabetes with deafness syndrome. Genetic testing confirmed the 
presence of the m.3243A>G mutation.
