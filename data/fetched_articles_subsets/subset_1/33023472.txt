BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential element for plants and abundantly present in 
most mineral soils. The mobility of iron is, however, dependent on the redox 
potential and hydrogen activity (pH) of the soil, factors that may limit its 
availability to plants in particular at alkaline pHs. Iron deficiency triggers 
pronounced changes in the transcriptional profile of plants, inducing processes 
that aid in the acquisition, uptake, and translocation of iron. How ambient pH 
impact the transcriptional iron deficiency response has not yet been elucidated 
in detail.
RESULTS: Here, we provide an RNA-seq data set that catalogs global gene 
expression changes of iron-deficient plants grown at either optimal (5.5) or 
high (7.0) pH. A suite of 857 genes changed significantly and more than twofold 
in expression; only 54 genes of this suite were also differentially expressed 
between iron-deficient and iron-sufficient plants grown at pH 5.5. Among the 
high pH-responsive genes, 186 were earlier shown to be responsive to short-term 
transfer to low pH, 91 genes of this subset were anti-directionally regulated by 
high and low pH. The latter subset contained genes involved in cell wall 
organization, auxin homeostasis, and potential hubs of yet undefined signaling 
circuits. Growing iron-deficient plants at high pH also modulated the 
transcriptional iron deficiency response observed at pH 5.5 by compromising the 
enzymatic reduction of ferric chelates and favoring the production of 
iron-mobilizing coumarins.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that ambient pH is an important determinant of 
global gene expression which tunes iron acquisition to the prevailing edaphic 
conditions.
