The A54T polymorphism of fatty acid-binding protein 2 may entail a reduction in 
fat-stimulated secretion of GIP that potentiates the adverse impact of fatty 
diets on insulin sensitivity.

A common polymorphism of the 54th codon of fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2), 
in which threonine substitutes for alanine (T54), has been linked to insulin 
resistance and/or increased postprandial triglycerides in various studies. I 
propose that, in subjects expressing T54, the secretion of gastric inhibitory 
polypeptide (GIP) evoked by fatty meals is subnormal, such that adipocytes are 
less efficient in converting chylomicrons to stored triglyceride. The increased 
postprandial free fatty acid flux which this may imply could be expected to 
exacerbate insulin resistance syndrome--thus accounting for the association of 
T54 with insulin resistance in epidemiological studies. If this thesis proves to 
be correct, it will help to clarify the importance of appropriate GIP secretion 
to maintenance of insulin sensitivity in the context of fatty diets.
