MEK inhibitors are among the most successful molecularly targeted agents used as 
cancer therapeutics. However, to treat cancer more efficiently, resistance to 
MEK inhibitor-induced cell death must be overcome. Although previous genetic 
approaches based on comprehensive gene expression analysis or RNAi libraries led 
to the discovery of factors involved in intrinsic resistance to MEK inhibitors, 
a feasible combined treatment with the MEK inhibitor has not yet been developed. 
Here, we show that a chemoproteoinformatics approach identifies ligands 
overcoming the resistance to cell death induced by MEK inhibition as well as the 
target molecule conferring this resistance. First, we used natural products, 
perillyl alcohol and sesaminol, which induced cell death in combination with the 
MEK inhibitor trametinib, as chemical probes, and identified ribosomal protein 
S5 (RPS5) as their common target protein. Consistently, trametinib induced cell 
death in RPS5-depleted cancer cells via upregulation of the apoptotic proteins 
BIM and PUMA. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
we then screened FDA- and EMA-approved drugs for RPS5-binding ligands and found 
that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, also known as aspirin) directly bound to RPS5, 
resulting in upregulation of BIM and PUMA and induction of cell death in 
combination with trametinib. Our chemoproteoinformatics approach demonstrates 
that RPS5 confers resistance to MEK inhibitor-induced cell death, and that 
aspirin could be repurposed to sensitize cells to MEK inhibition by binding to 
RPS5.
