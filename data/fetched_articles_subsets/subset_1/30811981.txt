Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder 
without effective neuroprotective therapy. Known genetic variants impair 
pathways, including RNA processing, axonal transport, and protein homeostasis. 
We report ALS-causing mutations within the gene encoding the glycosyltransferase 
GLT8D1. Exome sequencing in an autosomal-dominant ALS pedigree identified p.R92C 
mutations in GLT8D1, which co-segregate with disease. Sequencing of local and 
international cohorts demonstrated significant ALS association in the same exon, 
including additional rare deleterious mutations in conserved amino acids. 
Mutations are associated with the substrate binding site, and both R92C and G78W 
changes impair GLT8D1 enzyme activity. Mutated GLT8D1 exhibits in vitro 
cytotoxicity and induces motor deficits in zebrafish consistent with ALS. 
Relative toxicity of mutations in model systems mirrors clinical severity. In 
conclusion, we have linked ALS pathophysiology to inherited mutations that 
diminish the activity of a glycosyltransferase enzyme.
