PURPOSE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks the receptor targets 
estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2, and thus, it does not respond to receptor-targeted treatments. TNBC 
has higher recurrence, metastasis, and mortality rates than other subtypes of 
breast cancer. Mounting data suggest that the MAPK (also known as 
RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) pathway is an important therapeutic target in TNBC.
METHODS: To evaluate anti-tumor and anti-metastasis efficacy of E6201, we used 
cell proliferation assay, soft agar assay, cell cycle assay, Annexin V staining 
assay, immunoblotting analysis, immunohistochemistry, migration assay, invasion 
assay, mammary fat pad xenograft, and experimental and spontaneous metastasis 
xenograft models. We also evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy of E6201 plus CDK4/6 
inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor, or ATR inhibitor.
RESULTS: E6201 inhibited TNBC cell colony formation, migration, and invasion in 
a dose-dependent manner. E6201 induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. E6201 
inhibited TNBC xenograft growth and inhibited TNBC lung metastasis and improved 
mouse survival in experimental metastasis and spontaneous metastasis assays. 
Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that E6201 decreased the metastatic 
burden in the lung and decreased phosphorylated ERK expression in a 
dose-dependent manner. Combination of E6201 with CDK4/6 inhibitor or mTOR 
inhibitor enhanced E6201's in vitro anti-tumor efficacy.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that E6201 exhibits anti-tumor efficacy 
against TNBC in vitro and anti-metastasis efficacy against TNBC in vivo. These 
results provide a rationale for further clinical development of E6201 as a 
MAPK-pathway-targeted therapy for TNBC.
