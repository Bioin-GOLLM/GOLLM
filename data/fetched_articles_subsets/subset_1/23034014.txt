BACKGROUND: Vitamin D mediates immunomodulatory functions, and beneficial 
functions in allergic diseases have been suggested. Vitamin D receptor gene 
(VDR) polymorphisms are known but have not been studied in patients with atopic 
dermatitis (AD).
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of four common VDR gene polymorphisms 
in patients with AD, and their potential functional relevance.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 265 patients with AD [n=142 severe AD, 
Scoring AD index (SCORAD) > 40; n=123 moderate AD, SCORAD 15-40] and 265 healthy 
controls were genotyped for four common VDR gene polymorphisms by restriction 
fragment length polymorphism analysis. The VDR haplotype sequences were analysed 
in silico. Baseline and activation-induced gene expression of VDR and the 
vitamin D metabolizing enzyme CYP24A1 were analysed in monocytes of homozygous 
VDR haplotype carriers by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction.
RESULTS: In patients with severe AD, the VDR BsmI (rs1544410) G allele, ApaI 
(rs7975232) C allele and TaqI (rs731236) T alleles were over-represented 
compared with healthy controls. These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were 
tightly linked, and the VDR haplotype GCT was correlated with severe AD and 
complementary AAC with protection from AD. The VDR haplotype GCT region is 
evolutionarily conserved. The VDR FokI (rs2228570) SNP was not associated with 
AD. Baseline VDR expression in monocytes and short-term activation were 
haplotype independent.
CONCLUSION: A specific VDR haplotype is more frequent in patients with severe 
AD. These data indicate that VDR contributes to the control of AD, e.g. by 
regulation of the epidermal barrier function and/or local immune response.
