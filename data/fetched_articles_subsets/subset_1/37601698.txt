Desmoid tumor (DT) is a rare neoplasm characterized by the proliferation of 
myofibroblastic cells that infiltrates and invades adjacent tissues. Due to its 
locally aggressive and recurrent nature, DT often causes local symptoms and can 
be challenging to manage clinically. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can 
predict the progression of DT and guide treatment decisions is critical. This 
review summarizes several biomarkers that have been implicated in active 
surveillance (AS) and the prediction of postoperative recurrence and attempts to 
elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Some of these novel markers could provide 
prognostic value for clinicians, and ultimately help facilitate optimal and 
accurate therapeutic decisions for DT.
