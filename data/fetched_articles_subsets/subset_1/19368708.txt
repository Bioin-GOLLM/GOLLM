BACKGROUND: Germline mutations of the tumor suppressor genes SDHB, SDHC and SDHD 
play a major role in hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. These three 
genes encode subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), the mitochondrial 
tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme and complex II component of the electron 
transport chain. The majority of variants of the SDH genes are missense and 
nonsense mutations. To date few large deletions of the SDH genes have been 
described.
METHODS: We carried out gene deletion scanning using MLPA in 126 patients 
negative for point mutations in the SDH genes. We then proceeded to the 
molecular characterization of deletions, mapping breakpoints in each patient and 
used haplotype analysis to determine whether the deletions are due to a mutation 
hotspot or if a common haplotype indicated a single founder mutation.
RESULTS: A novel deletion of exon 3 of the SDHB gene was identified in nine 
apparently unrelated Dutch patients. An identical 7905 bp deletion, 
c.201-4429_287-933del, was found in all patients, resulting in a frameshift and 
a predicted truncated protein, p.Cys68HisfsX21. Haplotype analysis demonstrated 
a common haplotype at the SDHB locus. Index patients presented with 
pheochromocytoma, extra-adrenal PGL and HN-PGL. A lack of family history was 
seen in seven of the nine cases.
CONCLUSION: The identical exon 3 deletions and common haplotype in nine patients 
indicates that this mutation is the first Dutch SDHB founder mutation. The 
predominantly non-familial presentation of these patients strongly suggests 
reduced penetrance. In this small series HN-PGL occurs as frequently as 
pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal PGL.
