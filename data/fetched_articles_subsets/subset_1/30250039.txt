Recurrent de novo variants in the TBR1 transcription factor are implicated in 
the etiology of sporadic autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Disruptions include 
missense variants located in the T-box DNA-binding domain and previous work has 
demonstrated that they disrupt TBR1 protein function. Recent screens of 
thousands of simplex families with sporadic ASD cases uncovered additional T-box 
variants in TBR1 but their etiological relevance is unclear. We performed 
detailed functional analyses of de novo missense TBR1 variants found in the 
T-box of ASD cases, assessing many aspects of protein function, including 
subcellular localization, transcriptional activity and protein-interactions. 
Only two of the three tested variants severely disrupted TBR1 protein function, 
despite in silico predictions that all would be deleterious. Furthermore, we 
characterized a putative interaction with BCL11A, a transcription factor that 
was recently implicated in a neurodevelopmental syndrome involving developmental 
delay and language deficits. Our findings enhance understanding of molecular 
functions of TBR1, as well as highlighting the importance of functional testing 
of variants that emerge from next-generation sequencing, to decipher their 
contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.
