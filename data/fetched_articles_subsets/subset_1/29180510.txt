The cellular response to DNA damage is an intricate mechanism that involves the 
interplay among several pathways. In this study, we provide evidence of the 
roles of the polyadenylation factor cleavage stimulation factor 50 (CstF-50) and 
the ubiquitin (Ub) escort factor p97 as cofactors of BRCA1/BARD1 E3 Ub ligase, 
facilitating chromatin remodeling during the DNA damage response (DDR). CstF-50 
and p97 formed complexes with BRCA1/BARD1, Ub, and some BRCA1/BARD1 substrates, 
such as RNA polymerase (RNAP) II and histones. Furthermore, CstF-50 and p97 had 
an additive effect on the activation of the ubiquitination of these BRCA1/BARD1 
substrates during DDR. Importantly, as a result of these functional 
interactions, BRCA1/BARD1/CstF-50/p97 had a specific effect on the chromatin 
structure of genes that were differentially expressed. This study provides new 
insights into the roles of RNA processing, BRCA1/BARD1, the Ub pathway, and 
chromatin structure during DDR.
