The refinement of neural circuits during development depends on a dynamic 
process of branching of axons and dendrites that leads to synapse formation and 
connectivity. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is 
essential for the outgrowth and activity-dependent remodeling of axonal arbors 
in vivo. However, the mechanisms that translate extracellular signals into the 
formation of axonal branches are incompletely understood. We found that MAP 
kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) controls axon branching. MKP-1 expression induced 
by BDNF signaling caused spatiotemporal deactivation of c-jun N-terminal kinase 
(JNK), which reduced the phosphorylation of JNK substrates that destabilize 
microtubules. Indeed, neurons from mkp-1 null mice could not produce axon 
branches in response to BDNF. Our results identify a signaling mechanism that 
regulates axonal branching and provide a framework for studying the molecular 
mechanisms of innervation and axonal remodeling under normal and pathological 
conditions.
