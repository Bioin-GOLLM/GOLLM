Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged 
coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 
800 fatalities in 2003. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this 
epidemic. SARS-3CL(pro) has been shown to be essential for replication and is 
thus a target for drug discovery. Here, a class of stable benzotriazole esters 
was reported as mechanism-based inactivators of 3CL(pro), and the most potent 
inactivator exhibited a k(inact) of 0.0011 s(-1) and a K(i) of 7.5 nM. 
Mechanistic investigation with kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses indicates 
that the active site Cys145 is acylated, and that no irreversible inactivation 
was observed with the use of the C145A mutant. In addition, a noncovalent, 
competitive inhibition became apparent by using benzotriazole ester surrogates 
in which the bridged ester-oxygen group is replaced with carbon.
