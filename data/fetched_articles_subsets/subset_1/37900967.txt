Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme that exhibits transamidase, 
GTPase, kinase, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) activities. Of these, 
transamidase-mediated modification of proteins regulates apoptosis, 
differentiation, inflammation, and fibrosis. TG2 is highly expressed in 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) compared with differentiated cells, suggesting a 
role of TG2 specific for MSC characteristics. In this study, we report a new 
function of TG2 in the regulation of MSC redox homeostasis. During in vitro MSC 
expansion, TG2 is required for cell proliferation and self-renewal by preventing 
premature senescence but has no effect on the expression of surface antigens and 
oxidative stress-induced cell death. Moreover, induction of differentiation 
upregulates TG2 that promotes osteoblastic differentiation. Molecular analyses 
revealed that TG2 mediates tert-butylhydroquinone, but not sulforaphane, 
-induced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activation in a 
transamidase activity-independent manner. Differences in the mechanism of action 
between two NRF2 activators suggest that PDI activity of TG2 may be implicated 
in the stabilization of NRF2. The role of TG2 in the regulation of antioxidant 
response was further supported by transcriptomic analysis of MSC. These results 
indicate that TG2 is a critical enzyme in eliciting antioxidant response in MSC 
through NRF2 activation, providing a target for optimizing MSC manufacturing 
processes to prevent premature senescence.
