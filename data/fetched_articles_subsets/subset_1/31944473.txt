DNA polymerase δ, whose catalytic subunit is encoded by POLD1, is responsible 
for synthesizing the lagging strand of DNA. Single heterozygous POLD1 mutations 
in domains with polymerase and exonuclease activities have been reported to 
cause syndromic deafness as a part of multisystem metabolic disorder or 
predisposition to cancer. However, the phenotypes of diverse combinations of 
POLD1 genotypes have not been elucidated in humans. We found that five members 
of a multiplex family segregating autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural 
hearing loss (NS-SNHL) have revealed novel compound heterozygous POLD1 variants 
(p.Gly1100Arg and a presumptive null function variant, p.Ser197Hisfs*54). The 
recombinant p.Gly1100Arg polymerase δ showed a reduced polymerase activity by 
30-40%, but exhibited normal exonuclease activity. The polymerase activity in 
cell extracts from the affected subject carrying the two POLD1 mutant alleles 
was about 33% of normal controls. We suggest that significantly decreased 
polymerase δ activity, but not a complete absence, with normal exonuclease 
activity could lead to NS-SNHL.
