PrimPol has been recently identified as a DNA damage tolerant polymerase that 
plays an important role in replication stress response. However, the regulatory 
mechanisms of PrimPol are not well defined. In this study, we identify that the 
deubiquitinase USP36 interferes with degradation of PrimPol to regulate the 
replication stress response. Mechanistically, USP36 is deubiquitinated following 
DNA replication stress, which in turn facilitates its upregulation and 
interaction with PrimPol. USP36 deubiquitinates K29-linked polyubiquitination of 
PrimPol and increases its protein stability. Depletion of USP36 results in 
replication stress-related defects and elevates cell sensitivity to DNA-damage 
agents, such as cisplatin and olaparib. Moreover, USP36 expression positively 
correlates with the level of PrimPol protein and poor prognosis in patient 
samples. These findings indicate that the regulation of PrimPol K29-linked 
ubiquitination by USP36 plays a critical role in DNA replication stress and 
chemotherapy response.
