Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy with limited 
therapeutic options. The lack of mouse models that recapitulate the genetics of 
ACC has hampered progress in the field. We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) dataset for ACC and found that patients harboring alterations in both 
p53/Rb and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways show a worse prognosis compared with 
patients that harbored alterations in only one. To model this, we utilized the 
Cyp11b2(AS)Cre mouse line to generate mice with adrenocortical-specific 
Wnt/β-catenin activation, Trp53 deletion, or the combination of both. Mice with 
targeted Wnt/β-catenin activation or Trp53 deletion showed no changes associated 
with tumor formation. In contrast, alterations in both pathways led to ACC with 
pulmonary metastases. Similar to ACCs in humans, these tumors produced increased 
levels of corticosterone and aldosterone and showed a high proliferation index. 
Gene expression analysis revealed that mouse tumors exhibited downregulation of 
Star and Cyp11b1 and upregulation of Ezh2, similar to ACC patients with a poor 
prognosis. Altogether, these data show that altering both Wnt/β-catenin and 
p53/Rb signaling is sufficient to drive ACC in mouse. This autochthonous model 
of ACC represents a new tool to investigate the biology of ACC and to identify 
new treatment strategies.
