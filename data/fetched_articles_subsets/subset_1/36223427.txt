Plasmodium parasites are reliant on the Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2) transcription 
factor family to regulate gene expression programs. AP2 DNA binding domains have 
no homologs in the human or mosquito host genomes, making them potential 
antimalarial drug targets. Using an in-silico screen to dock thousands of small 
molecules into the crystal structure of the AP2-EXP (Pf3D7_1466400) AP2 domain 
(PDB:3IGM), we identified putative AP2-EXP interacting compounds. Four compounds 
were found to block DNA binding by AP2-EXP and at least one additional ApiAP2 
protein. Our top ApiAP2 competitor compound perturbs the transcriptome of P. 
falciparum trophozoites and results in a decrease in abundance of log2 fold 
change > 2 for 50% (46/93) of AP2-EXP target genes. Additionally, two ApiAP2 
competitor compounds have multi-stage anti-Plasmodium activity against blood and 
mosquito stage parasites. In summary, we describe a novel set of antimalarial 
compounds that interact with AP2 DNA binding domains. These compounds may be 
used for future chemical genetic interrogation of ApiAP2 proteins or serve as 
starting points for a new class of antimalarial therapeutics.
