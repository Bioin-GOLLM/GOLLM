Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unprecedented opportunity to 
mimic human diseases of related cell types, but it is unclear whether they can 
successfully mimic age-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). We 
generated iPSCs lines from three patients with familial PD associated with the 
G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene and one age-matched healthy individual 
(control). During long-term culture, dopaminergic (DA) neurons differentiated 
from iPSCs of G2019S LRRK2 PD patients exhibited morphological changes, 
including a reduced number of neurites and neurite arborization, which were not 
evident in DA neurons differentiated from control iPSCs. To mimic PD pathology 
in vitro, we used 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium (MPP+) to damage DA neurons and 
found that DA neurons differentiated from patients with G2019S LRRK2 mutation 
significantly reduced the survival rate and increased apoptosis compared with 
the controls. We also found that the mRNA level of inflammatory factors 
[interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, IL-6, and 
inducible NO synthase] with G2019S LRRK2 mutation were higher than control group 
after exposure to MPP+. Our study provides an in vitro model based on iPSCs that 
captures the patients' genetic complexity and investigates the pathogenesis of 
familial PD cases in a disease-associated cell type.
