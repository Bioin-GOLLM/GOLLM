Noncoding transcripts originating upstream of the immunoglobulin constant region 
(I transcripts) are required to direct activation-induced deaminase to initiate 
class switching in B cells. Differential regulation of Iε and Iγ1 transcription 
in response to interleukin 4 (IL-4), hence class switching to IgE and IgG1, is 
not fully understood. In this study, we combine novel mouse reporters and 
single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal the heterogeneity in IL-4-induced I 
transcription. We identify an early population of cells expressing Iε but not 
Iγ1 and demonstrate that early Iε transcription leads to switching to IgE and 
occurs at lower activation levels than Iγ1. Our results reveal how probabilistic 
transcription with a lower activation threshold for Iε directs the early choice 
of IgE versus IgG1, a key physiological response against parasitic infestations 
and a mediator of allergy and asthma.
