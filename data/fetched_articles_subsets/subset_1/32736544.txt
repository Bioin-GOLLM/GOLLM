BACKGROUND: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest onset and the most 
severe form of all inherited retinal degenerative disorders, characterized by 
blindness, or severe visual impairment from birth, and typically exhibits 
clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Recently, 14 causative genes of LCA were 
reported. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) for Japanese siblings, and 
identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the RPGR-interacting protein 
1 (RPGRIP1) gene. We also report their follow-up data over 27 years.
CASE PRESENTATION: Patient 1 is a 37-year-old male. In 1992, his eye position 
indicated orthophoria, however, horizontal nystagmus was evident, and he 
complained of photophobia. His best corrected decimal visual acuity (BCVA) was 
0.2 (S + 6.5/C-3.5/170°) OD and 0.1 (S + 6.0/C-2.5/10°) OS. Fundus examination 
revealed bisymmetrical inferior focal retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mottling. 
Bright-flash electroretinogram (ERG) revealed a subnormal pattern, while 30 Hz 
flicker ERG was non-recordable in both eyes. At his final visit in 2019, his 
BCVA was 0.09 (S + 3.5/C-3.5/180°) OD and 0.09 (S + 3.0/C-4.0/10°) OS. Patient 
2, a 34-year-old female, is the sibling of patient 1. In 1992, her BCVA was 0.05 
(S + 6.0) OD and 0.06 (S + 5.0) OS. She was in a chin-up position during visual 
acuity testing. Horizontal nystagmus was evident, and she also complained of 
photophobia. Bright-flash ERG was severely attenuated, and 30 Hz flicker ERG was 
non-recordable in both eyes. At her final visit in 2019, her BCVA was 0.02 
(uncorrectable) OD and 0.03 (uncorrectable) OS. There were no other patients 
with LCA in their family and their parents were non-consanguineous. WES revealed 
a homozygous, consecutive, two-nucleotide variation in the RPGRIP1 gene 
(NM_020366: exon15:c.G2294A and c.C2295A, p.C765X), resulting in a premature 
stop codon. We interpreted this variation as a novel pathogenic mutation of 
RPGRIP1 that contributes to LCA6 development.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report a novel nonsense mutation of RPGRIP1 in two 
patients with LCA6 and present their long-term follow-up data. These clinical 
data linked to genotypes provide important information for the development of 
new treatments, such as gene therapy, as well as for genetic counseling.
