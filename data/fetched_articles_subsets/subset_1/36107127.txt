Cytoplasmic Dynein 1, or Dynein, is a microtubule minus end-directed motor. 
Dynein motility requires Dynactin and a family of activating adaptors that 
stabilize the Dynein-Dynactin complex and promote regulated interactions with 
cargo in space and time. How activating adaptors limit Dynein activation to 
specialized subcellular locales is unclear. Here, we reveal that Spindly, a 
mitotic Dynein adaptor at the kinetochore corona, exists natively in a closed 
conformation that occludes binding of Dynein-Dynactin to its CC1 box and Spindly 
motif. A structure-based analysis identified various mutations promoting an open 
conformation of Spindly that binds Dynein-Dynactin. A region of Spindly 
downstream from the Spindly motif and not required for cargo binding faces the 
CC1 box and stabilizes the intramolecular closed conformation. This region is 
also required for robust kinetochore localization of Spindly, suggesting that 
kinetochores promote Spindly activation to recruit Dynein. Thus, our work 
illustrates how specific Dynein activation at a defined cellular locale may 
require multiple factors.
