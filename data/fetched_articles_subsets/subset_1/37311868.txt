BACKGROUND: Lactase persistence-the ability to digest lactose through 
adulthood-is closely related to evolutionary adaptations and has affected many 
populations since the beginning of cattle breeding. Nevertheless, the contrast 
initial phenotype, lactase non-persistence or adult lactase deficiency, is still 
observed in large numbers of people worldwide.
METHODS: We performed a multiethnic genetic study of lactase deficiency on 
24,439 people, the largest in Russia to date. The percent of each population 
group was estimated according to the local ancestry inference results. 
Additionally, we calculated frequencies of rs4988235 GG genotype in Russian 
regions using the information of current location and birthplace data from the 
client's questionnaire.
RESULTS: The attained results show that among all studied population groups, the 
frequency of GG genotype in rs4988235 is higher than the average in the European 
populations. In particular, the prevalence of lactase deficiency genotype in the 
East Slavs group was 42.8% (95% CI: 42.1-43.4%). We also investigated the 
regional prevalence of lactase deficiency based on the current place of 
residence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes the significance of genetic testing for 
diagnostics, i.e., specifically for lactose intolerance parameter, as well as 
the scale of the problem of lactase deficiency in Russia which needs to be 
addressed by the healthcare and food sectors.
