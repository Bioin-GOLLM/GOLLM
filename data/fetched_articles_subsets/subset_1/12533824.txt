The APC I1307K allele is believed to predispose to multiple colorectal tumours 
because the change at the nucleotide level-A(3)TA(4) to A(8)-creates a 
hypermutable site. Slippage of the A(8) tract undoubtedly occurs more often than 
expected in the tumours of I1307K carriers, but many of these tumours do not 
harbour changes at this site. Outside the A(8) tract, the tumours of I1307K 
carriers appear to harbour fewer somatic frameshift mutations than expected. 
There is inconsistent evidence as to whether or not I1307K confers an increased 
risk of colorectal cancer. Most I1307K patients and families who have undergone 
analysis of somatic APC mutations have been highly selected. It is therefore 
possible that many APC I1307K carriers with multiple adenomas have a 
susceptibility to tumours additional to that resulting from the A(8) tract.
