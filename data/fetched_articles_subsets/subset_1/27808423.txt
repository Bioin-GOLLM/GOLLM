The seven members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R)-associated 
factor (TRAF) family of intracellular proteins were originally discovered and 
characterized as signaling adaptor molecules coupled to the cytoplasmic regions 
of receptors of the TNF-R superfamily. Functionally, TRAFs act both as a 
scaffold and/or enzymatic proteins to regulate activation of mitogen-activated 
protein kinases (MAPKs) and transcription factors of nuclear factor-κB family 
(NF-κB). Given the wide variety of stimuli intracellularly conveyed by TRAF 
proteins, they are physiologically involved in multiple biological processes, 
including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and regulation of innate 
and adaptive immune responses. In the last few years, it has become increasingly 
evident the involvement of TRAF7, the last member of the TRAF family to be 
discovered, in the genesis and progression of several human cancers, placing 
TRAF7 in the spotlight as a novel tumor suppressor protein. In this paper, we 
review and discuss the literature recently produced on this subject. J. Cell.
