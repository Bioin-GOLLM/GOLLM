Patients receiving brain radiotherapy may suffer acute or chronic side effects. 
Ionizing radiation induces the production of intracellular reactive oxygen 
species and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system, leading to 
brain damage. Complementary Chinese herbal medicine therapy may reduce 
radiotherapy-induced side effects. Flavonoids are a class of natural products 
which can be extracted from Chinese herbal medicine and have been shown to have 
neuroprotective and radioprotective properties. Flavonoids are effective 
antioxidants and can also inhibit regulatory enzymes or transcription factors 
important for controlling inflammatory mediators, affect oxidative stress 
through interaction with DNA and enhance genomic stability. In this paper, 
radiation-induced brain damage and the relevant molecular mechanism were 
summarized. The radio-neuro-protective effect of flavonoids, i.e., antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory and maintaining genomic stability, were then reviewed. We 
concluded that flavonoids treatment may be a promising complementary therapy to 
prevent radiotherapy-induced brain pathophysiological changes and cognitive 
impairment.
