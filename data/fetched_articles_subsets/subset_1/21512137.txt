A-Raf kinase can inhibit apoptosis by binding to the proapoptotic mammalian 
sterile 20-like kinase (MST2). This function relies on expression of hnRNP H, 
which ensures the correct splicing of a-raf mRNA needed to produce full-length 
A-Raf protein. Here, we showed that expression of hnRNP H and production of 
full-length A-Raf is positively controlled by c-Myc. Low c-Myc reduces hnRNP H 
expression and switches a-raf splicing to produce A-Raf(short), a truncated 
protein. Importantly, A-Raf(short) fails to regulate MST2 but retains the 
Ras-binding domain such that it functions as a dominant negative mutant 
suppressing Ras activation and transformation. Human colon and head and neck 
cancers exhibit high hnRNP H and high c-Myc levels resulting in enhanced A-Raf 
expression and reduced expression of A-Raf(short). Conversely, in normal cells 
and tissues in which c-Myc and hnRNP H are low, A-Raf(short) suppresses 
extracellular signal regulated kinase activation such that it may act as a 
safeguard against oncogenic transformation. Our findings offered a new paradigm 
to understand how c-Myc coordinates diverse cell functions by directly affecting 
alternate splicing of key signaling components.
