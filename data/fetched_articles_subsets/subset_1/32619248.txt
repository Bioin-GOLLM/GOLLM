OBJECTIVE: To analyze variant of IDS gene in a pedigree affected with 
mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II).
METHODS: The proband was subjected to next generation sequencing and Sanger 
sequencing to identify potential variants. Suspected variant was analyzed by its 
co-segregation with the disease in the pedigree. Its impact on mRNA splicing was 
analyzed by using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: A hemizygous IVS1-3T>G variant was found in the IDS gene in the 
proband. RT-PCR results revealed two abnormal cDNA fragments of 600 bp and 300 
bp. The 600 bp fragment had inserted 216 nucleotides at the 3' end of intron 1, 
while the 300 bp fragment had lost 109 nucleotides at the 5' end of exon 2, 
which resulted in two truncated proteins comprising 38 and 92 amino acids, 
respectively, instead of the normal product (550 amino acids). The proband and 
his mother were respectively hemizygous and heterozygous for the variant. The 
same variant was not found among 100 normal controls.
CONCLUSION: The IVS1-3T>G variant of the IDS gene probably underlies the MPS II 
in this pedigree by causing reduction or elimination of the IDS protein.
