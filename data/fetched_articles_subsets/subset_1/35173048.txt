G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play crucial roles in numerous physiological 
and pathological processes. Mutations in GPCRs that result in loss of function 
or alterations in signaling can lead to inherited or acquired diseases. Herein, 
studying prokineticin receptor 2 (PROKR2), we initially identify distinct 
interactomes for wild-type (WT) versus a mutant (P290S) PROKR2 that causes 
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. We then find that both the WT and mutant PROKR2 
are targeted for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation, but the 
mutant is degraded to a greater extent. Further analysis revealed that both 
forms can also leave the ER to reach the Golgi. However, whereas most of the WT 
is further transported to the cell surface, most of the mutant is retrieved to 
the ER. Thus, the post-ER itinerary plays an important role in distinguishing 
the ultimate fate of the WT versus the mutant. We have further discovered that 
this post-ER itinerary reduces ER stress induced by the mutant PROKR2. Moreover, 
we extend the core findings to another model GPCR. Our findings advance the 
understanding of disease pathogenesis induced by a mutation at a key residue 
that is conserved across many GPCRs and thus contributes to a fundamental 
understanding of the diverse mechanisms used by cellular quality control to 
accommodate misfolded proteins.
