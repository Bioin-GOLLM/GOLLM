Eukaryotic cells possess numerous dynamic membrane-less organelles, RNP 
granules, enriched in RNA and RNA-binding proteins containing 
disordered regions. We demonstrate that the disordered regions of key RNP 
granule components and the full-length granule protein hnRNPA1 can phase 
separate in vitro, producing dynamic liquid droplets. Phase separation is 
promoted by low salt concentrations or RNA. Over time, the droplets mature to 
more stable states, as assessed by slowed fluorescence recovery after 
photobleaching and resistance to salt. Maturation often coincides with formation 
of fibrous structures. Different disordered domains can co-assemble into 
phase-separated droplets. These biophysical properties demonstrate a plausible 
mechanism by which interactions between disordered regions, coupled with RNA 
binding, could contribute to RNP granule assembly in vivo through promoting 
phase separation. Progression from dynamic liquids to stable fibers may be 
regulated to produce cellular structures with diverse physiochemical properties 
and functions. Misregulation could contribute to diseases involving aberrant RNA 
granules.
