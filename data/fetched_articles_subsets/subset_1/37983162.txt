The first example of the Kumada-Tamao-Corriu type reaction of unprotected 
bromoanilines with Grignard reagents is described. The method uses a palladium 
source and a newly designed Buchwald-type ligand as the catalytic system. 
Secondary and tertiary bromo- and iodoamines were also successfully coupled to 
alkyl Grignard reagents. The products of the competitive β-hydride elimination 
reaction were successfully reduced using a highly efficient electron-deficient 
phosphine ligand (BPhos). Mechanistic considerations allowed us to establish 
that the less electron-rich phosphine ligands stabilize the transition state 
much better than the electron-rich ones; hence, they increase the reaction yield 
and reduce the amount of β-hydride elimination products. The developed method 
proved to be tolerant of many functional groups and can be applied to many 
different aromatic bromo- and iodoamines. Multigram synthesis of p-toluidine 
from 4-bromoaniline was achieved with a palladium catalyst loading of only 0.03 
mol%.
