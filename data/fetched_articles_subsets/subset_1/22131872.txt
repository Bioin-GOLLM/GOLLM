Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal 
disorders. Diagnosis can be challenging as more than 40 genes are known to cause 
non-syndromic RP and phenotypic expression can differ significantly resulting in 
variations in disease severity, age of onset, rate of progression, and clinical 
findings. We describe the clinical manifestations of RP, the more commonly known 
causative gene mutations, and the genotypic-phenotypic correlation of RP.
