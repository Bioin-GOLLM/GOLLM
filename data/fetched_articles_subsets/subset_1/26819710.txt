BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease characterized by leukocyte skin 
infiltration. Interestingly, recent works suggest that the migration of 
dendritic cells (DCs) is abnormal in psoriatic skin. DCs have significant role 
in regulating the function of T lymphocytes, at least in part influenced by the 
local environment of cytokines. In psoriatic skin lesions the expression of 
IL-20 is highly up-regulated. It is unclear if this cytokine has any influence 
on DCs.
METHODS: Here, we investigated the influence of IL-20 in monocyte-derived 
dendritic cell (MDDCs) in vitro. This work addressed IL-20 effects on DC 
maturation, receptor expression and signaling. By use of extra cellular matrix 
components mimicking the skin environment, we also studied the functional 
effects of IL-20 on the chemotactic migration of DCs. Based on the recent 
finding that CD18 integrin are shed during migration of myeloid leukocytes, the 
concentration of these adhesion molecules was measured in MDDCs culture 
supernatants post migration.
RESULTS: Following stimulation with IL-20, immature human MDDCs enhanced the 
expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86, further enabling activation of 
the p38 MAPK, but not the STAT3, pathway. IL-20 increased the migration of MDDCs 
in a biphasic response narrowly controlled by the interleukin concentration. A 
concomitant change in the shedding of CD18 integrins suggested that these 
adhesion molecules play a role in the migration of the MDDCs through the 
extracellular matrix layer.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings points to a possible, yet subtle, role 
of IL-20 in DCs migration. The biphasic response suggests that the aberrant 
IL-20 expression in psoriasis impedes DC migration, which could be a part of the 
processes that precipitates the dysregulated inflammatory response associated 
with this disease.
