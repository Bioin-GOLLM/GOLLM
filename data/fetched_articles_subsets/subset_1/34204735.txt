The receptor for advanced glycation-end products (RAGE) is a multiligand 
receptor with a role in inflammatory and pulmonary pathologies. Hyperactivation 
of RAGE by its ligands has been reported to sustain inflammation and oxidative 
stress in common comorbidities of severe COVID-19. RAGE is essential to the 
deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which participates in 
infection and multiorgan injury in COVID-19 patients. Thus, RAGE might be a 
major player in severe COVID-19, and appears to be a useful therapeutic 
molecular target in infections by SARS-CoV-2. The role of RAGE gene 
polymorphisms in predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 is discussed.&nbsp.
