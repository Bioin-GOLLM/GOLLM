OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of intralabyrinthine schwannoma (ILS) 
utilizing the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), a unique medical consortium 
in the United States that covers a complete population of all ages in a 
well-defined geographic area over the past half-century.
PATIENTS: All patients with ILS diagnosed between January 1, 1966 and December 
31, 2016 in Olmsted County, Minnesota, identified using the REP medical 
records-linkage system.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of ILS.
RESULTS: Fourteen incident cases of ILS were identified in Olmsted County since 
1966-a period spanning 5.9 million person-years. Over the past decade, the 
incidence rate of ILS was 0.81 per 100,000 person-years and 1.1 over the last 5 
years. Since 1966, the cumulative incidence rate of ILS over the past 50 years 
was 0.26 per 100,000 person-years. The median age at diagnosis was 60 years 
(interquartile ranges, 39-70). Incidence increased with age: over the last 5 
years, those aged 60 to 69 exhibited an incidence rate of 2.7 per 100,000 
person-years and those 70+ displayed a rate of 4.1. All patients had varying 
levels of asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss with 64% of patients 
presenting with class D hearing. Four (29%) patients had a history of sudden 
sensorineural hearing loss, five (36%) reported imbalance and/or vertigo, and 
four (29%) reported aural fullness. Three of the 14 (21%) patients had 
neurofibromatosis type 2.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of ILS exceeds 1 per 100,000 person-years with modern 
diagnostic imaging. The rising incidence of ILS in recent years most likely 
reflects improved capacity for disease detection rather than a true increase in 
tumor development. Given the reputability of the REP consortium, these data 
suggest that ILS comprises a more common entity than previously considered.
