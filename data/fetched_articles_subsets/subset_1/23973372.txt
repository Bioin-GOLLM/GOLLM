The individuals carrying melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) variants, especially 
those associated with red hair color, fair skin, and poor tanning ability (RHC 
trait), are more prone to melanoma; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly 
defined. Here, we report that UVB exposure triggers phosphatase and tensin 
homolog (PTEN) interaction with wild-type (WT), but not RHC-associated MC1R 
variants, which protects PTEN from WWP2-mediated degradation, leading to AKT 
inactivation. Strikingly, the biological consequences of the failure of MC1R 
variants to suppress PI3K/AKT signaling are highly context dependent. In primary 
melanocytes, hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling leads to premature 
senescence; in the presence of BRAF(V600E), MC1R deficiency-induced elevated 
PI3K/AKT signaling drives oncogenic transformation. These studies establish the 
MC1R-PTEN axis as a central regulator for melanocytes' response to UVB exposure 
and reveal the molecular basis underlying the association between MC1R variants 
and melanomagenesis.
