BACKGROUND: Adiposity amplifies the genetic risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD).
AIM: We evaluated the association between overweight-years, a cumulative 
exposure based on the product of the duration and severity of excess body weight 
(body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2 ), and genetic risk on liver fat and fibrosis.
METHODS: This is a longitudinal analysis derived from a prospective cohort of 
adults in the Framingham Heart Study who underwent genotyping and 
vibration-controlled-transient-elastography with controlled attenuation 
parameter. Univariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses 
were used to assess the association between overweight-years and liver fat and 
fibrosis. The association between genetic variants of liver fat (PNPLA3, TM6SF2, 
GCKR) and fibrosis (PNPLA3, TM6SF2, HSD17B13) was also assessed using a 
polygenic risk score.
RESULTS: Our sample included 2478 participants (54% women) with mean age and BMI 
of 40 (±8.5) years and 26.5(±5.1) kg/m2 , respectively. The mean follow-up was 
14(±0.9) years, and each participant underwent three study visits. The 
prevalence of NAFLD was 28.3% (n = 700), and 207 (8.4%) had clinically 
significant fibrosis. In age-, sex- and diabetes-adjusted multivariable 
analyses, overweight-years (per SD) had a strong association with NAFLD (aOR 
3.53 [95% CI: 3.10-4.02], p < 0.001), clinically significant fibrosis (aOR 1.60 
[95% CI: 1.40-1.84], p < 0.001) and cirrhosis (aOR 1.81 [95% CI: 1.38-2.37], 
p < 0.001). High-polygenic risk was significantly associated with liver fat and 
clinically significant fibrosis (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Overweight-years is strongly associated with NAFLD and clinically 
significant fibrosis and combined with polygenic risk may assist in defining the 
trajectory of NAFLD.
