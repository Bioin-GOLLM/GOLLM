Background and Objectives: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been implicated 
as major determinants of tumour growth and metastasis, which are considered two 
of the main hallmarks of cancer. The interaction of MMP8 and other signalling 
molecules within and adjacent tumoral tissues, including immune cells, are 
rather elusive, particularly of adenocarcinoma cell type. In this study, we 
aimed to investigate the role of MMP8 in non-small cell lung cancer 
proliferation and invasiveness potential. Materials and Methods: We individually 
lipofected with two different single guide RNA (sgRNAs) that specifically 
targeted on MMP8, with CRISPR-Cas 9 protein into the cells. Results: Our results 
clearly indicated that the lipofection of these complexes could lead to reduced 
ability of A549 cells to survive and proliferate to form colonies. In addition, 
when compared to non-transfected cells, the experimental cell groups receiving 
sgRNAs demonstrated relatively decreased migration rate, hence, wider wound gaps 
in scratch assay. The quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
demonstrated significant reduction in the MAP-K, survivin and PI3-K gene 
expression. MMP8 might have protective roles over tumour growth and spread in 
our body. Conclusions: The delivery of sgRNAs targeting on the MMP8 gene could 
induce tumour cell death and arrest cell migratory activity.
