The receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) has been implicated 
in the pathogenesis of a variety of human cancers, including breast cancer. 
Here, we analyzed the clinical significance of ROR2 in breast cancer (BC) 
progression, and its function in the regulation of BC cell proliferation and 
growth. Analysis of ROR2 mRNA levels in 45 BC tissues and adjacent non-tumor 
tissues revealed that ROR2 expression was significantly increased in BC tissues, 
and that it correlated with tumor diameter. Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival 
(DFS) analysis demonstrated that BC patients with higher ROR2 expression had 
lower DFS. Knockdown of ROR2 suppressed in vitro proliferation of BC cells and 
promoted apoptosis, while ROR2 overexpression induced BC cell proliferation and 
suppressed apoptosis. Importantly, ROR2 suppression also reduced the tumor 
growth in mouse BC xenografts, indicating that ROR2 promotes BC tumorigenesis in 
vivo. In addition, our data revealed that ROR2 promotes proliferation of BC 
cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Together, our results 
indicate that ROR2 acts as an oncogenic gene in breast cancer, and suggest that 
the ROR2/PI3K/AKT regulatory network contributes to breast cancer progression.
