Leveraging recent advances in computational modeling of proteins with AlphaFold2 
(AF2) we provide a complete curated data set of all single mutations from each 
of the 7 main SARS-CoV-2 lineages spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) 
resulting in 3819X7 = 26733 PDB structures. We visualize the generated 
structures and show that AF2 pLDDT values are correlated with state-of-the-art 
disorder approximations, implying some internal protein dynamics are also 
captured by the model. Joint increasing mutational coverage of both structural 
and phenotype data coupled with advances in machine learning can be leveraged to 
accelerate virology research, specifically future variant prediction. We hope 
this data release can offer assistance into further understanding of the local 
and global mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 as well as provide insight into 
the biological understanding that 3D structure acts as a bridge between protein 
genotype and phenotype.
