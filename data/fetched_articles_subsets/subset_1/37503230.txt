INTRODUCTION: A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) intronic to chromosome 9 
open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) is recognized as the most common genetic cause 
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 
ALS-FTD. Identifying genes that show similar regional co-expression patterns to 
C9orf72 may help identify novel gene targets and biological mechanisms that 
mediate selective vulnerability to ALS and FTD pathogenesis.
METHODS: We leveraged mRNA expression data in healthy brain from the Allen Human 
Brain Atlas to evaluate C9orf72 co-expression patterns. To do this, we 
correlated average C9orf72 expression values in 51 regions across different 
anatomical divisions (cortex, subcortex, cerebellum) with average gene 
expression values for 15,633 protein-coding genes, including 50 genes known to 
be associated with ALS, FTD, or ALS-FTD. We then evaluated whether the 
identified C9orf72 co-expressed genes correlated with patterns of cortical 
thickness in symptomatic C9orf72 pathogenic HRE carriers (n=19). Lastly, we 
explored whether genes with significant C9orf72 radiogenomic correlations (i.e., 
'C9orf72 gene network') were enriched in specific cell populations in the brain 
and enriched for specific biological and molecular pathways.
RESULTS: A total of 1,748 genes showed an anatomical distribution of gene 
expression in the brain similar to C9orf72 and significantly correlated with 
patterns of cortical thickness in C9orf72 HRE carriers. This C9orf72 gene 
network was differentially expressed in cell populations previously implicated 
in ALS and FTD, including layer 5b cells, cholinergic motor neurons in the 
spinal cord, and medium spiny neurons of the striatum, and was enriched for 
biological and molecular pathways associated with multiple neurotransmitter 
systems, protein ubiquitination, autophagy, and MAPK signaling, among others.
CONCLUSIONS: Considered together, we identified a network of C9orf72-associated 
genes that may influence selective regional and cell-type-specific 
vulnerabilities in ALS/FTD.
