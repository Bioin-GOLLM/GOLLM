An asphyxiated term neonate required postnatal resuscitation. After six minutes 
of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and two doses of epinephrine, 
spontaneous circulation returned, but was shortly followed by ventricular 
fibrillation. CPR and administration of magnesium, calcium gluconate, and sodium 
bicarbonate did not improve the neonate's condition. A counter shock of five 
Joule was delivered and the cardiac rhythm immediately converted to sinus 
rhythm. The neonate was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit and 
received post-resuscitation care. Due to prolonged QTc and subsequently 
suspected long-QT syndrome propranolol treatment was initiated. The neonate was 
discharged home on day 14 without neurological sequelae.
