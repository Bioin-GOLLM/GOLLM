Methylmalonyl CoA mutase deficiency due to MUT gene defect has been known as the 
main cause of isolated methylmalonic acidemia in Mainland China. This study 
reported a patient with isolated methylmalonic aciduria (MUT type) characterized 
as acute brainstem encephalitis and myelitis. The previously healthy girl 
presented with fever, lethargy and progressive weakness in her extremities at 
the age of 3 years and 2 months. Three day later, she had respiratory distress 
and consciousness. Cranial MRI revealed bilateral symmetrical lesion of 
pallidum, brain stem and spinal cord, indicating acute brainstem encephalitis 
and myelitis. Her blood propionylcarnitine (6.83 μmol/L vs normal range 1.0 to 
5.0 μmol/L) and urinary methylmalonic acid (133.22 mmol/mol creatinine vs normal 
range 0.2 to 3.6 mmol/mol creatinine) increased significantly. Plasma total 
homocysteine was normal. On her MUT gene, a reported mutation (c.1630_1631GG>TA) 
and a novel mutation (c.1663C>T, p.A555T) were identified, which confirmed the 
diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria (MUT type). After cobalamin injection, 
protein-restricted diet with the supplements of special formula and L-carnitine, 
progressive improvement has been observed. The clinical manifestation of 
patients with methylmalonic aciduria is complex. Metabolic study and gene 
analysis are keys for the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder.
