BACKGROUND: Little data exists on the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
in the Russian population. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of CKD in a 
population-based study in Russia, compare with a similar study in Norway, and 
investigate whether differences in risk factors explained between-study 
differences in CKD.
METHODS: We compared age- and sex-standardised prevalence of reduced eGFR 
(< 60 ml/min/1.73m2 CKD-EPI creatinine equation), albuminuria and or a composite 
indicator of CKD (one measure of either reduced eGFR or albuminuria) between 
participants aged 40-69 in the population-based Know Your Heart (KYH) study, 
Russia (2015-2018 N = 4607) and the seventh Tromsø Study (Tromsø7), Norway 
(2015-2016 N = 17,646). We assessed the contribution of established CKD risk 
factors (low education, diabetes, hypertension, antihypertensive use, smoking, 
obesity) to between-study differences using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Prevalence of reduced eGFR or albuminuria was 6.5% (95% Confidence 
Interval (CI) 5.4, 7.7) in KYH and 4.6% (95% CI 4.0, 5.2) in Tromsø7 
standardised for sex and age. Odds of both clinical outcomes were higher in KYH 
than Tromsø7 (reduced eGFR OR 2.06 95% CI 1.67, 2.54; albuminuria OR 1.54 95% CI 
1.16, 2.03) adjusted for sex and age. Risk factor adjustment explained the 
observed between-study difference in albuminuria (OR 0.92 95% CI 0.68, 1.25) but 
only partially reduced eGFR (OR 1.42 95% CI 1.11, 1.82). The strongest 
explanatory factors for the between-study difference was higher use of 
antihypertensives (Russian sample) for reduced eGFR and mean diastolic blood 
pressure for albuminuria.
CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence of a higher burden of CKD within the sample from 
the population in Arkhangelsk and Novosibirsk compared to Tromsø, partly 
explained by between-study population differences in established risk factors. 
In particular hypertension defined by medication use was an important factor 
associated with the higher CKD prevalence in the Russian sample.
