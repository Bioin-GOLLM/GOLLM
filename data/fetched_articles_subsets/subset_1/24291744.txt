Transient receptor potential, melastatin-like 7 (Trpm7) is a combined ion 
channel and kinase implicated in the differentiation or function of many cell 
types. Early lethality in mice and frogs depleted of the corresponding gene 
impedes investigation of the functions of this protein particularly during later 
stages of development. By contrast, zebrafish trpm7 mutant larvae undergo early 
morphogenesis normally and thus do not have this limitation. The mutant larvae 
are characterized by multiple defects including melanocyte cell death, transient 
paralysis, and an ion imbalance that leads to the development of kidney stones. 
Here we report a requirement for Trpm7 in differentiation or function of 
dopaminergic neurons in vivo. First, trpm7 mutant larvae are hypomotile and fail 
to make a dopamine-dependent developmental transition in swim-bout length. Both 
of these deficits are partially rescued by the application of levodopa or 
dopamine. Second, histological analysis reveals that in trpm7 mutants a 
significant fraction of dopaminergic neurons lack expression of tyrosine 
hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. Third, trpm7 
mutants are unusually sensitive to the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, 
an oxidative stressor, and their motility is partially rescued by application of 
the iron chelator deferoxamine, an anti-oxidant. Finally, in SH-SY5Y cells, 
which model aspects of human dopaminergic neurons, forced expression of a 
channel-dead variant of TRPM7 causes cell death. In summary, a forward genetic 
screen in zebrafish has revealed that both melanocytes and dopaminergic neurons 
depend on the ion channel Trpm7. The mechanistic underpinning of this dependence 
requires further investigation.
