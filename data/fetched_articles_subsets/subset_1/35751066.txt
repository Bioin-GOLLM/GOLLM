BACKGROUND: Pullorum disease caused by Salmonella pullorum is one of the most 
important infectious diseases in the poultry industry, responsible for causing 
substantial economic losses globally. On farms, the traditional method to detect 
S. pullorum infection mainly involves the collection of feces and sera to test 
for antigens and antibodies, respectively, but the regularity of Salmonella 
pullorum dissemination in internal organs and shedding patterns and antibody 
production in infected chickens remains unclear. Herein we aimed to investigate 
the dissemination of S. pullorum to different organs and bacterial shedding 
patterns in the faeces as well as serum antibody production post-infection in 
chickens of different ages.
RESULT: In this study, the liver and heart of 2-day-old chickens showed the 
highest copy numbers of S. pullorum at 6.4 × 106 and 1.9 × 106 copies of DNA 
target sequences/30 mg, respectively. In case of 10-day-old chickens, the 
percentage of S. pullorum fecal shedding (0%-40%) and antibody production 
(0%-56.6%) markedly fluctuated during the entire experiment; furthermore, in 
case of 42-week-old chickens, the percentage of birds showing S. pullorum 
shedding in the faeces showed a downward trend (from 63.33% to 6.6% in the oral 
inoculation group and from 43.3% to 10% in the intraperitoneal injection group), 
while that of birds showing serum antibody production remained at a high level 
(38.3% and 80% in the oral inoculation and intraperitoneal injection groups, 
respectively). We also performed cohabitation experiments, showed that 15% 
10-day-old and 3.33% 42-week-old chickens were infected via the horizontal 
transmission in cohabitation with S. pullorum infected chickens, and revealed a 
high risk of horizontal transmission of S. pullorum.
CONCLUSION: This study systematically evaluated the dissemination of S. pullorum 
in internal organs and bacterial fecal shedding patterns, and antibody 
production in infected chickens. Collectively, our findings indicate how to 
effectively screen S. pullorum-negative chickens on livestock farms and should 
also help in the development of measures to control and eradicate S. pullorum.
