RATIONALE: Valproate (VPA) is a choice for the treatment of primary generalized 
epilepsies and partial epilepsies. Unfortunately, weight gain or obesity is one 
of the most frequent adverse effects of VPA treatment. Genetic factors were 
shown to be involved in the effect.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of selected 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) 
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) with VPA-induced weight 
gain and obesity in epileptic patients.
METHODS: A total of 225 Chinese Han epilepsy patients receiving VPA treatment 
were recruited in the study. Height and weight for the calculation of body mass 
index (BMI) were measured at the initiation of VPA therapy and in the follow-up 
examination. A BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher was defined as obesity on the basis of 
the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for Asian populations. Four SNPs in 
CD36 (rs1194197, rs7807607) and PPARγ (rs10865710, rs2920502) were genotyped 
using the Sequenom® MassArray iPlex platform.
RESULTS: About 19.6% of epileptic patients receiving VPA therapy were found to 
become obese. After covariate analysis of age, gender, sex, height, initial BMI, 
and VPA dosage, the CD36 rs1194197 C allele and rs7807607 T allele (OR, 0.31; 
95%CI, 0.13-0.72; P = 0.009 and OR, 0.38; 95%CI; 0.18-0.83; P = 0.02, 
respectively) were identified as protective factors for VPA-induced obesity. The 
PPARγ rs10865710 C allele carriers were found to be less likely to suffer from 
VPA-induced obesity compared with GG genotype carriers (OR, 0.04; 95%CI, 
0.01-0.12; P < 0.001). After a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, 
the genotypic associations of CD36 rs1194197 and PPARγ rs10865710 and the 
allelic association of CD36 rs7807607 with obesity remained statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data first indicated that CD36 and PPARγ polymorphisms may be 
associated with VPA-induced obesity and weight gain, suggesting that CD36 and 
PPARγ may have potential value in predicting VPA-induced obesity in Chinese Han 
epileptic patients.
