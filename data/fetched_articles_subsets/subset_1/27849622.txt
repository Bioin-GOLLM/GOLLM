BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of dihydrotestosterone conversion [5α-reductase 
deficiency: online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) 607306] or actions of 
androgens [partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS): OMIM 312300] during 
the 8th-12th weeks of gestation cause varying degrees of undervirilized external 
genitalia in 46, XY disorders of sex development (DSD) with increased 
testosterone production. The objective of the study was to determine clinical 
and genetic characteristics of Thai patients with 46, XY DSD.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 46, XY DSD with increased 
testosterone production (n=43) evaluated by a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 
stimulation test or clinical features consistent with 5α-reductase deficiency or 
PAIS. PCR sequencing of the entire coding regions of the SRD5A2 and AR genes was 
performed. Molecular modeling analysis of the androgen receptor-ligand-binding 
domain (AR-LBD) of a novel mutation was constructed.
RESULTS: Mutations were found in seven patients (16.3%): five (11.6%) and two 
(4.7%) patients had mutations in SRD5A2 and AR, respectively. Two novel 
mutations, SRD5A2 c.383A>G (p.Y128C) and AR c.2176C>T (p.R726C), were 
identified. Dimensional structural analysis of the novel mutated AR (p.R726C) 
revealed that it affected the co-activator binding [binding function-3 (BF-3)], 
not the testosterone binding site. Short phallus length was associated with 
5α-reductase deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS: Around 16.3% of our patients with 46, XY DSD had 5α-reductase 
deficiency or PAIS. Two novel mutations of SRD5A2 and AR were identified. The 
novel mutated AR (p.R726C) might affect the co-activator binding (BF-3), not the 
testosterone binding site.
