PURPOSE: Humulus japonicus (HJ) is one of the most important causes of weed 
pollinosis in East Asia. The 10 kDa protein with pI 10 in 2-dimensional gel has 
been recognized as the representative major allergen of HJ, but its major 
allergens have not been characterized. This study aimed to characterize the 
major allergen of HJ.
METHODS: A major allergen in Japanese hop was detected by proteome analysis; it 
was purified to homogeneity and its sequence was obtained by transcriptome 
analysis. The recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and Pichia 
expression systems, and their immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivities were compared 
to those of the natural counterpart. We also analyzed post-translational 
modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation.
RESULTS: Pectin methylesterase inhibitor, Hum j 6, was found to be the major 
allergen of HJ, and in silico signal peptide prediction corresponds to a 15.1 
kDa protein with a theoretical pI of 8.28. Natural Hum j 6 was recognized by IgE 
antibodies from 86.4% (19/22) of HJ pollinosis patients, whereas the recombinant 
proteins did not show strong IgE reactivity. No glycosylation was detected, 
while at least 15 phosphorylated amino acids, possibly causing the pI and 
molecular weight shift, were detected by tandem mass spectrometry analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Hum j 6 was identified as the representative major allergen of HJ 
and seems to be modified significantly after translation. These findings are 
useful for the development of component-resolved diagnosis and immunotherapy.
