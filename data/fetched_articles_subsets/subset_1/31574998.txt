Wilson's disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disorder, results in copper 
accumulation in the liver as a consequence of mutations in the gene ATPase 
copper transporting beta (ATP7B). The disease is characterized by chronic 
hepatitis, eventually resulting in liver cirrhosis. Recent studies have shown 
that dysregulation of nuclear receptors (NR) by high hepatic copper levels is an 
important event in the pathogenesis of liver disease in WD. Intracellular 
trafficking of ATP7B is mediated by COMMD1 and, in Bedlington terriers, a 
mutation in the COMMD1 gene results in high hepatic copper levels. Here, we 
demonstrate a reduced Farnesoid X nuclear receptor (FXR)-activity in liver 
biopsies of COMMD1-deficient dogs with copper toxicosis, a unique large animal 
model of WD. FXR-induced target genes, small heterodimer partner (SHP), and 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) were down-regulated in liver samples from 
COMMD1-deficient dogs with hepatic copper accumulation. In contrast, the 
relative mRNA levels of the two CYP-enzymes (reduced by FXR activity) was 
similar in both groups. These data are in line with the previously observed 
reduced FXR activity in livers of ATP7B-/- mice and WD patients. Therefore, 
these data further corroborate on the importance of the COMMD1-deficient dogs as 
a large animal model for WD.
