Splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPL) is an extremely rare 
B-cell lymphoma. The disease is typically indolent and treatment with 
splenectomy usually results in durable remissions. Here, we present a case of an 
extremely aggressive course of SDRPL with transformation to diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma and multiple relapses immediately following cessation of 
immunochemotherapy. We provide results from whole-exome sequencing from debut of 
SDRPL and from following transformed stages and identified a novel somatic 
mutation in RB1 as the possible driver of this aggressive disease, which has not 
been reported earlier in SDRPL.
