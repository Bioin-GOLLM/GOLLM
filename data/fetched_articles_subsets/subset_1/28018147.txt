Gene expression programs are largely regulated by the tissue-specific expression 
of lineage-defining transcription factors or by the inducible expression of 
transcription factors in response to specific stimuli. Here I will review our 
own work over the last 20 years to show how specific activation signals also 
lead to the wide-spread re-distribution of pre-existing constitutive 
transcription factors to sites undergoing chromatin reorganization. I will 
summarize studies showing that activation of kinase signaling pathways creates 
open chromatin regions that recruit pre-existing factors which were previously 
unable to bind to closed chromatin. As models I will draw upon genes activated 
or primed by receptor signaling in memory T cells, and genes activated by 
cytokine receptor mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. I also summarize a 
hit-and-run model of stable epigenetic reprograming in memory T cells, mediated 
by transient Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) binding, which enables the accelerated 
activation of inducible enhancers.
