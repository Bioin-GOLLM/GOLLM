A genetic screen for Dictyostelium mutant displaying high level of constitutive 
phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate led to the finding that the 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored superoxide dismutase SodC regulates 
small GTPase Ras. Cells that lack SodC exhibited constitutively high levels of 
active Ras, more membrane localization of GFP-PHcrac, and defects in 
chemoattractant sensing, cell polarization and motility. These defects of 
SodC-lacking cells were partially restored by expression of wild-type SodC but 
not by the catalytically inactive mutant SodC (H245R, H247Q). Furthermore, an 
inhibition of PI3K activity in SodC-deficient cells by LY294002 only partially 
restored chemoattractant sensing and cell polarization, consistent with the fact 
that SodC-deficient cells have aberrantly high level of active Ras, which 
functions upstream of PI3K. A higher level of active GFP-RasG was observed in 
SodC-deficient cells, which significantly decreased upon incubation of 
SodC-deficient cells with the superoxide scavenger XTT. Having constitutively 
high levels of active Ras proteins and more membrane localization of GFP-PHcrac, 
SodC-deficient cells exhibited severe defects in chemoattractant sensing, cell 
polarization and motility.
