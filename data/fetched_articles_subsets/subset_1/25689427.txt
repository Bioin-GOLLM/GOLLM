The actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin protein family is essential for 
actin dynamics, cell division, chemotaxis and tumor metastasis. Cofilin-1 
(CFL-1) is a primary non-muscle isoform of the ADF/cofilin protein family 
accelerating the actin filamental turnover in vitro and in vivo. In response to 
environmental stimulation, CFL-1 enters the nucleus to regulate the actin 
dynamics. Although the purpose of this cytoplasm-nucleus transition remains 
unclear, it is speculated that the interaction between CFL-1 and DNA may 
influence various biological responses, including DNA damage repair. In this 
review, we will discuss the possible involvement of CFL-1 in DNA damage 
responses (DDR) induced by ionizing radiation (IR), and the implications for 
cancer radiotherapy.
