Important structural differences imply that human and mouse mast cell chymases 
may differ with respect to their enzymatic properties. We compared in this study 
the catalytic efficiencies of recombinant human chymase (rCMA1) and its 
functional murine homologue recombinant mouse mast cell protease-4 (rmMCP-4) 
toward a fluorogenic chymase substrate 
(Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and by their ability to 
convert Big-endothelin (ET)-1 into ET-1 (1-31) using a LC/MS/MS system. 
Activities toward a fluorogenic substrate (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC) and Big ET-1 
were also measured in extracts from mouse peritoneal mast cells, LUVA human mast 
cell-like cells and human aortas. The specificity of these activities was 
assessed with the chymase inhibitor TY-51469 
(2-[4-(5-fluoro-3-methylbenzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)sulfonamido-3-methanesulfonyl-phenyl]thiazole-4-carboxylic 
acid). For similar affinities, rmMCP-4 showed a higher activity toward the 
fluorogenic substrate and a higher ability to process Big ET-1 as compared to 
recombinant CMA1 (chymase activity (kcat/KM in μM(-1)s(-1)): 2.29 × 10(-4)vs. 
6.41 × 10(-6); ET-1 (1-31) production: 2.19 × 10(-3)vs. 6.57 × 10(-5)), and both 
of these activities of mouse and human chymase were sensitive to TY-51469. 
Furthermore, extracts from mouse peritoneal mast cells, LUVA cells and human 
aorta homogenates contained processing activities toward the fluorogenic chymase 
substrate as well as Big ET-1, all of which were sensitive to TY-51469. Finally, 
the pressor responses to Big ET-1 but not to ET-1 were significantly reduced in 
conscious and free moving mMCP-4 KO mice when compared to wild type congeners. 
Our results suggest that both mouse and human chymases have potent ET-1 
(1-31)-producing abilities, with the murine isoform being more efficient.
