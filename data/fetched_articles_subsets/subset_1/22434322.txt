We have investigated the practicality of implementing a strategy for 
site-specific editing by homologous recombination in zebrafish analogous to that 
developed by Rong and Golic (Rong and Golic in Genetics 157:1307-1312, 2001) in 
Drosophila melanogaster. We analysed approximately 7,300 offspring from 22 
crosses and demonstrated successful excision of the gene editing construct but 
failed to detect either gene editing or the random integration of the intact 
editing construct subsequent to excision. The clustering of events in our data 
set demonstrates that the excision events are not occurring independently and 
emphasise that a promoter driving high level, tissue-specific transcription in 
meiotic cells is likely to be necessary if this general approach to 
site-specific editing by homologous recombination is to fulfil its potential.
