Epidemiological evidence has long associated environmental mutagens with 
increased cancer risk. However, links between specific mutation-causing 
processes and the acquisition of individual driver mutations have remained 
obscure. Here we have used public cancer sequencing data from 11,336 cancers of 
various types to infer the independent effects of mutation and selection on the 
set of driver mutations in a cancer type. First, we detect associations between 
a range of mutational processes, including those linked to smoking, ageing, 
APOBEC and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and the presence of key driver mutations 
across cancer types. Second, we quantify differential selection between 
well-known alternative driver mutations, including differences in selection 
between distinct mutant residues in the same gene. These results show that while 
mutational processes have a large role in determining which driver mutations are 
present in a cancer, the role of selection frequently dominates.
