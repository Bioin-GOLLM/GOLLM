BACKGROUND: Ambroxol (ABX) has been suggested as an augmentative pharmacological 
agent for neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD). This study assessed the long-term 
safety and efficacy of combined therapy with high-dose ABX and enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) in nGD.
METHODS: ABX+ERT therapy was administered for 4.5 years in four patients with 
nGD. ABX was initiated at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day, and the dose was escalated up 
to 27 mg/kg/day. The target plasma level was 10 µmol/L or less. The changes in 
glucocerebrosidase activity, biochemical, safety and neurocognitive findings 
were assessed.
RESULTS: Enhanced residual GCcase activity was observed in all patients, as 
evidenced in both in vitro and in vivo studies. During the first 2 years of 
study with ABX (up to 21 mg/kg/day), mean seizure frequencies and neurocognitive 
function worsened. After ABX dosage was increased up to 27 mg/kg/day of ABX, its 
trough plasma concentration was 3.2-8.8 µmol/L. Drug-to-drug interaction, 
especially with antiepileptic drug significantly affected the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of ABX. Importantly, at 27 mg/kg/day of ABX, the seizure frequencies 
markedly decreased from the baseline, and the neurocognitive function was 
improved. In addition, Lyso-Gb1, a biomarker for the severity and progression of 
GD, was normalised in all patients. High-dose ABX was well-tolerated with no 
severe adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with high-dose ABX+ERT was safe and might help 
to arrest the progression of the neurological manifestations in GD.
