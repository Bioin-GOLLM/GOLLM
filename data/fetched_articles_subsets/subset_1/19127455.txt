BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a genetically conditioned autoimmune 
disease in which cytokines play an important role. Objectives. To check for the 
association of polymorphisms of cytokine genes with type 1 diabetes. Subjects. 
This work included 50 cases with T1D and 98 healthy individuals from the Nile 
Delta region of Egypt. Cases included 20 males and 30 females with a median age 
of 25 and range of 15-50 years.
METHODS: DNA was amplified using PCR with sequence-specific primers for 
detection of polymorphisms related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha(- 308) 
(G/A), interleukin (IL)-10(- 1082) (G/A), IL-6(- 174) (G/C), and IL-1Ra (VNTR).
RESULTS: Cases with T1D showed significant higher frequency of genotypes of 
TNF-alpha(- 308) AA (p < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 7.91), IL-6-17CC (p < 0.05, OR 
= 3.36) and IL-1Ra A1A1 (p < 0.05, OR = 3.68) with significant lower frequencies 
of TNF-alpha(- 308) GA, and IL-1Ra A1A2 genotypes (p < 0.001 and < 0.05, 
respectively). They also showed significant higher frequency of TNF-alpha(- 308) 
allele A (p < 0.05, OR = 2.0), IL-1Ra allele A1 (p < 0.05, OR = 2.98) with a 
significant lower frequency of TNF-alpha(- 308) G allele and IL-1Ra A2 allele (p 
< 0.05). No significant difference was detected among cases in relation to 
IL-10(- 1082) (G/A) genotypes or alleles nor in relation to age, sex, 
consanguinity or family history of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms related to TNF-alpha and IL-1Ra genes may be 
considered genetic markers for T1D among Egyptians with a potential impact on 
family counseling and management.
