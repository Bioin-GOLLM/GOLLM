Cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) NKCC1 and NKCC2 catalyze electroneutral 
symport of 1 Na+, 1 K+, and 2 Cl- across cell membranes. NKCC1 mediates 
trans-epithelial Cl- secretion and regulates excitability of some neurons and 
NKCC2 is critical to renal salt reabsorption. Both transporters are inhibited by 
the so-called loop diuretics including bumetanide, and these drugs are a 
mainstay for treating edema and hypertension. Here, our single-particle electron 
cryo-microscopy structures supported by functional studies reveal an 
outward-facing conformation of NKCC1, showing bumetanide wedged into a pocket in 
the extracellular ion translocation pathway. Based on these and the previously 
published inward-facing structures, we define the translocation pathway and the 
conformational changes necessary for ion translocation. We also identify an 
NKCC1 dimer with separated transmembrane domains and extensive transmembrane and 
C-terminal domain interactions. We further define an N-terminal 
phosphoregulatory domain that interacts with the C-terminal domain, suggesting a 
mechanism whereby (de)phosphorylation regulates NKCC1 by tuning the strength of 
this domain association.
