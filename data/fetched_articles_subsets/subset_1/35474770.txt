We prepared Nafion composite membranes by impregnating Nafion-212 with 
polydopamine, poly(sulfonated dopamine), and poly(dopamine-co-sulfonated 
dopamine) using the swelling-filling method to generate nanopores in the Nafion 
framework that were filled with these polymers. Compared to the pristine 
Nafion-212 membrane, these composite membranes showed improved thermal and 
mechanical stabilities due to the strong interactions between the catecholamine 
of the polydopamine derivatives and the Nafion matrix. For the composite 
membrane filled with poly(sulfonated dopamine) (N-PSDA), further interactions 
were induced between the Nafion and the sulfonic acid side chain, resulting in 
enhanced water uptake and ion conductivity. In addition, filling the nanopores 
in the Nafion matrix with polymer fillers containing aromatic hydrocarbon-based 
dopamine units led to an increase in the degree of crystallinity and resulted in 
a significant decrease in the hydrogen permeability of the composite membranes 
compared to Nafion-212. Hydrogen crossovers 26.8% lower than Nafion-212 at 95% 
relative humidity (RH) (fuel cell operating conditions) and 27.3% lower at 100% 
RH (water electrolysis operating conditions) were obtained. When applied to 
proton exchange membrane-based fuel cells, N-PSDA exhibited a peak power density 
of 966 mW cm-2, whereas N-PSDA showed a current density of 4785 mA cm-2, which 
is 12.4% higher than Nafion-212 at 2.0 V and 80 °C.
