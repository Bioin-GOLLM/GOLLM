Entry of herpes simplex virus (HSV) occurs either by fusion at the plasma 
membrane or by endocytosis and fusion with an endosome. Binding of glycoprotein 
D (gD) to a receptor such as nectin-1 is essential in both cases. We show that 
virion gD triggered the rapid down-regulation of nectin-1 with kinetics similar 
to those of virus entry. In contrast, nectin-1 was not constitutively recycled 
from the surface of uninfected cells. Both the nectin-1alpha and beta isoforms 
were internalized in response to gD despite having different cytoplasmic tails. 
However, deletion of the nectin-1 cytoplasmic tail slowed down-regulation of 
nectin-1 and internalization of virions. These data suggest that nectin-1 
interaction with a cytoplasmic protein is not required for its down-regulation. 
Overall, this study shows that gD binding actively induces the rapid 
internalization of various forms of nectin-1. We suggest that HSV activates a 
nectin-1 internalization pathway to use for endocytic entry.
