Malignant melanoma is characterized by both genetic and molecular alterations 
that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and RAS/BRAF pathways. In this 
work, through diversity-based high-throughput virtual screening we identified a 
lead molecule that selectively targets PI3K and BRAFV600E kinases. Computational 
screening, Molecular dynamics simulation and MMPBSA calculations were performed. 
PI3K and BRAFV600E kinase inhibition was done. A375 and G-361 cells were used 
for in vitro cellular analysis to determine antiproliferative effects, annexin V 
binding, nuclear fragmentation and cell cycle analysis. Computational screening 
of small molecules indicates compound CB-006-3 selectively targets PI3KCG (gamma 
subunit), PI3KCD (delta subunit) and BRAFV600E. Molecular dynamics simulation 
and MMPBSA bases binding free energy calculations predict a stable binding of 
CB-006-3 to the active sites of PI3K and BRAFV600E. The compound effectively 
inhibited PI3KCG, PI3KCD and BRAFV600E kinases with respective IC50 values of 
75.80, 160.10 and 70.84 nM. CB-006-3 controlled the proliferation of A375 and 
G-361 cells with GI50 values of 223.3 and 143.6 nM, respectively. A dose 
dependent increase in apoptotic cell population and sub G0/G1 phase of cell 
cycle were also observed with the compound treatment in addition to observed 
nuclear fragmentation in these cells. Furthermore, CB-006-3 inhibited BRAFV600E, 
PI3KCD and PI3KCG in both melanoma cells. Collectively, based on the 
computational modeling and in vitro validations, we propose CB-006-3 as a lead 
candidate for selectively targeting PI3K and mutant BRAFV600E to inhibit 
melanoma cell proliferation. Further experimental validations, including 
pharmacokinetic evaluations in mouse models will identify the druggability of 
the proposed lead candidate for further development as a therapeutic agent for 
treating melanoma.
