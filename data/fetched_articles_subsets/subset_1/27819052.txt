PrimPol is a novel human enzyme that contains both DNA primase and DNA 
polymerase activities. We present the first structure of human PrimPol in 
ternary complex with a DNA template-primer and an incoming deoxynucleoside 
triphosphate (dNTP). The ability of PrimPol to function as a DNA primase stems 
from a simple but remarkable feature-almost complete lack of contacts to the DNA 
primer strand. This, in turn, allows two dNTPs to bind initiation and elongation 
sites on the enzyme for the formation of the first dinucleotide. PrimPol shows 
the ability to synthesize DNA opposite ultraviolet (UV) lesions; however, 
unexpectedly, the active-site cleft of the enzyme is constrained, which 
precludes the bypass of UV-induced DNA lesions by conventional translesion 
synthesis. Together, the structure addresses long-standing questions about how 
DNA primases actually initiate synthesis and how primase and polymerase 
activities combine in a single enzyme to carry out DNA synthesis.
