Congestive hepatopathy can have a mildly elevated liver profile, which should 
normalize with appropriate therapy. Liver specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in 
decompensated heart failure (HF) can be mildly elevated. The levels exceeding 
beyond the expected rise should be a concern and lead to further investigation. 
The literature reports insubstantial number of cases regarding significantly 
elevated levels of ALP and congestive hepatopathy. We report a case of a 
45-year-old female with known history of severe cardiomyopathy that had 
persistently elevated levels of ALP. The extensive workup was negative for any 
specific pathology. The liver biopsy was consistent with congestive hepatopathy. 
The patient's ALP levels decreased with aggressive diuretic therapy but still 
remained elevated.
