Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
defined by motor neuron loss. Transgenic mouse models show features that closely 
mimic those seen in the clinical situation, reflected in the molecular changes 
observed in mouse models and in tissues from patients. We report a dramatic 
increase in the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hindlimb 
muscles, but not the spinal cord of the G93A transgenic mouse model, 
significantly before the appearance of clinical abnormalities. APP levels were 
unchanged in nontransgenic mice and in mice overexpressing human wild-type 
Cu/Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Preliminary results indicate a 
similar change in APP expression in human deltoid muscle samples from ALS 
patients compared with age-matched controls. The inhibitory role of APP in 
innervation at the neuromuscular junction and increased expression in 
inclusion-body myositis suggest that presymptomatic upregulation of APP may be 
consistent with a potential role for APP in ALS pathology.
