We have now at our disposal the new rapid-acting insulin analogs, of which 
insulin lispro was the first to become commercially available. While the 
differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics are 
indisputable, the clinical benefits attained by these changes have not been as 
clear. In the present review, we discuss the structure, pharmacology, and 
landmark studies related to insulin lispro. The clinical characteristics of 
insulin lispro are compared with those of insulin regular and other insulin 
analogs in different clinical situations. Also included are the aspects of 
quality of life and cost-effectiveness that may modify the modern practitioner's 
decision to adopt one type of insulin over another.
