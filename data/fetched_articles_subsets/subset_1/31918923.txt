OBJECTIVE: Obesity is the result of positive energy balance. It can be caused by 
excessive energy consumption but also by decreased energy dissipation, which 
occurs under several conditions including when the development or activation of 
brown adipose tissue (BAT) is impaired. Here we evaluated whether iRhom2, the 
essential cofactor for the Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) sheddase ADAM17/TACE, 
plays a role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome.
METHODS: We challenged WT versus iRhom2 KO mice to positive energy balance by 
chronic exposure to a high fat diet and then compared their metabolic 
phenotypes. We also carried out ex vivo assays with primary and immortalized 
mouse brown adipocytes to establish the autonomy of the effect of loss of iRhom2 
on thermogenesis and respiration.
RESULTS: Deletion of iRhom2 protected mice from weight gain, dyslipidemia, 
adipose tissue inflammation, and hepatic steatosis and improved insulin 
sensitivity when challenged by a high fat diet. Crucially, the loss of iRhom2 
promotes thermogenesis via BAT activation and beige adipocyte recruitment, 
enabling iRhom2 KO mice to dissipate excess energy more efficiently than WT 
animals. This effect on enhanced thermogenesis is cell-autonomous in brown 
adipocytes as iRhom2 KOs exhibit elevated UCP1 levels and increased 
mitochondrial proton leak.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that iRhom2 is a negative regulator of 
thermogenesis and plays a role in the control of adipose tissue homeostasis 
during metabolic disease.
