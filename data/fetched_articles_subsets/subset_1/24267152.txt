PURPOSE: The interaction between the Leishmania parasite and the host cell 
involves complex, multifaceted processes. The disease severity in cutaneous 
leishmaniasis (CL) is largely dependent on the causative species. Most of the 
information on immune responses in human CL is available with respect to L. 
major infection and is lacking for L. tropica species. In this study, we 
employed cytokine/chemokine/receptor membrane cDNA array to capture 
comprehensive picture of immuno-determinants in localized human tissue during L. 
tropica infection. Expression of selected molecules was evaluated by real time 
PCR in dermal lesion tissues at pre- and post treatment stages. Plasma IL-17 
level was estimated by sandwich ELISA.
RESULTS: The cDNA array analysis identified several immuno-determinants in 
tissue lesions of Indian CL including cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, 
IL-13), chemokines (IL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4) and apoptotic molecules (Fas, TRAIL, 
IRF-1). Elevated mRNA levels of Th17 (IL-17, IL-23 and RORγt) and Treg (CD25, 
CTLA-4 and Foxp3) markers were observed in lesion tissues of CL patients 
compared to the control group, which subsided post treatment. Plasma IL-17 
levels were found to be significantly higher in CL samples compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to defining comprehensive immunological responses 
inside lesion tissues of CL patients, our study demonstrated the presence of 
Th17 and Treg cells in CL caused by L. tropica.
