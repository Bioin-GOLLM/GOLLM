Human malaria infection is a major challenge across the globe and is responsible 
for millions of deaths annually. Rapidly emerging drug resistant strains against 
the new class of anti-malarial drugs are major threat to control the disease 
burden worldwide. Helicases are present in every organism and have important 
role in various nucleic acid metabolic processes. Previously we have reported 
the presence of three parasite specific helicases (PSH) in Plasmodium falciparum 
3D7 strain. Here we present the detailed biochemical characterization of PfPSH2. 
PfPSH2 is DNA and RNA stimulated ATPase and is able to unwind partially duplex 
DNA and RNA substrates. It can translocate in both 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' 
directions. PfPSH2 is expressed in all the stages of intraerythrocytic 
development and it is localized in cytoplasm in P. falciparum 3D7 strain. The 
dsRNA mediated inhibition study suggests that PfPSH2 is important for the growth 
and survival of the parasite. This study presents the detailed characterization 
of PfPSH2 and lays the foundation for future development of PfPSH2 as drug 
target.
