RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: To research the association of prothrombin (factor II) 
activity given the prothrombin G20210A mutation carriage with its clinical 
manifestations as thrombotic complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective clinical cohort study of 290 women of 
reproductive age was conducted. Two cohort groups were identified: the study 
group of 140 patients with prothrombin mutation G20210A genotype and the control 
group of 150 women with G20210G genotype.
RESULTS: The prothrombin G20210A mutation carriage is associated with the risk 
of thrombotic complications compared to the wild G20210G type (RR =17.1; 
p<0.0001) and is characterized by thrombosis localized both in the venous 
(66.7%) and arterial (33.3%) vascular pools. The threshold value of prothrombin 
activity (174.8%) for G20210A genotype was calculated, making it possible to 
conclusively predict the risk of thrombotic events with the accuracy of 90.4%.
CONCLUSION: The phenotypic manifestation of the prothrombin G20210A mutation in 
the form of venous and arterial thromboses in women of reproductive age is 
associated with a super-threshold increase in prothrombin (factor II) activity, 
which makes it possible to stratify the patients into the group of high risk of 
thromboses.
