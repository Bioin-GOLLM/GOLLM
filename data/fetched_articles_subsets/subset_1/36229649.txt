Although cyclosporine comprises a well-established systemic therapy for 
psoriasis, patients show important heterogeneity in their treatment response. 
The aim of our study was the pharmacogenetic analysis of 200 Greek patients with 
psoriasis based on the cyclosporine pathway related protein-protein interaction 
(PPI) network, reconstructed through the PICKLE meta-database. We genotyped 27 
single nucleotide polymorphisms, mapped to 22 key protein nodes of the 
cyclosporine pathway, via the utilization of the iPLEX®GOLD panel of the 
MassARRAY® System. Single-SNP analyses showed statistically significant 
associations between CALM1 rs12885713 (P = 0.0108) and MALT1 rs2874116 
(P = 0.0006) polymorphisms with positive response to cyclosporine therapy after 
correction for multiple comparisons, with the haplotype analyses further 
enhancing the predictive value of rs12885713 as a pharmacogenetic biomarker for 
cyclosporine therapy (P = 0.0173). Our findings have the potential to improve 
our prediction of cyclosporine efficacy and safety in psoriasis patients, as 
well as provide the framework for the pharmacogenetics of biological therapies 
in complex diseases.
