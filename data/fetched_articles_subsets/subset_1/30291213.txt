How single nucleotide polymorphisms in long non-coding RNAs are involved in 
cancer susceptibility remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that polymerase 
II polypeptide E (POLR2E) rs3787016 polymorphism, identified in a genome-wide 
association study of prostate cancer, might be a common genetic risk factor for 
cancer risk. To address this issue, we here conducted a case-control study to 
investigate the association of POLR2E rs3787016 polymorphism with risk of liver 
and lung cancer (including 800 normal controls, 480 liver cancer patients, and 
550 lung cancer patients), followed by a meta-analysis. The genotyping was 
performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
and confirmed by sequencing. Although no significant association was found for 
rs3787016 with risk of liver or lung cancer, the further stratified analysis 
identified that rs3787016 contributed to liver cancer risk particularly for over 
than 60 years individuals who drink. Moreover, the meta-analysis demonstrated 
that rs3787016 was associated with overall cancer risk and prostate cancer risk. 
Collectively, the POLR2E rs3787016 polymorphism may be a valuable biomarker for 
cancer predisposition.
