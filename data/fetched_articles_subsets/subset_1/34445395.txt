Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intrinsic antioxidant in the central 
nervous system, and its substrate cysteine readily becomes the oxidized dimeric 
cystine. Since neurons lack a cystine transport system, neuronal GSH synthesis 
depends on cystine uptake via the cystine/glutamate exchange transporter (xCT), 
GSH synthesis, and release in/from surrounding astrocytes. Transcription factor 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a detoxifying master 
transcription factor, is expressed mainly in astrocytes and activates the gene 
expression of various phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes or antioxidants 
including GSH-related molecules and metallothionein by binding to the 
antioxidant response element (ARE) of these genes. Accumulating evidence has 
shown the involvement of dysfunction of antioxidative molecules including GSH 
and its related molecules in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) or 
parkinsonian models. Furthermore, we found several agents targeting GSH 
synthesis in the astrocytes that protect nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal 
loss in PD models. In this article, the neuroprotective effects of 
supplementation and enhancement of GSH and its related molecules in PD pathology 
are reviewed, along with introducing new experimental findings, especially 
targeting of the xCT-GSH synthetic system and Nrf2-ARE pathway in astrocytes.
