Threonine aldolases have emerged as a powerful tool for asymmetric carbon-carbon 
bond formation. These enzymes catalyse the unnatural aldol condensation of 
different aldehydes and glycine to produce highly valuable β-hydroxy-α-amino 
acids with complete stereocontrol at the α-carbon and moderate specificity at 
the β-carbon. A range of microbial threonine aldolases has been recently 
recombinantly produced by several groups and their biochemical properties were 
characterized. Numerous studies have been conducted to improve the reaction 
protocols to enable higher conversions and investigate the substrate scope of 
enzymes. However, the application of threonine aldolases in organic synthesis is 
still limited due to often moderate yields and low diastereoselectivities 
obtained in the aldol reaction. This review briefly summarizes the screening 
techniques recently applied to discover novel threonine aldolases as well as 
enzyme engineering and mutagenesis studies which were accomplished to improve 
the catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Additionally, the results from 
new investigations on threonine aldolases including crystal structure 
determinations and structural-functional characterization are reviewed.
