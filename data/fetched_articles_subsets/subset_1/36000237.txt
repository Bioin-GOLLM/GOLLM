Genetic factors are involved in the development, progression, and severity of 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Polymorphisms in genes regulating 
liver functions may increase liver susceptibility to NAFLD. Therefore, we 
conducted this literature study to present recent findings on NAFLD-associated 
polymorphisms from published articles in PubMed from 2016 to 2021. From 69 
selected research articles, 20 genes and 34 SNPs were reported to be associated 
with NAFLD. These mutated genes affect NAFLD by promoting liver steatosis 
(PNPLA3, MBOAT7, TM2SF6, PTPRD, FNDC5, IL-1B, PPARGC1A, UCP2, TCF7L2, SAMM50, 
IL-6, AGTR1, and NNMT), inflammation (PNPLA3, TNF-Î±, AGTR1, IL-17A, IL-1B, 
PTPRD, and GATAD2A), and fibrosis (IL-1B, PNPLA3, MBOAT7, TCF7L2, GATAD2A, IL-6, 
NNMT, UCP, AGTR1, and TM2SF6). The identification of these genetic factors helps 
to better understand the pathogenesis pathways of NAFLD.
