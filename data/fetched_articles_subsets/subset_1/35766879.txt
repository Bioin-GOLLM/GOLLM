The D620N mutation in vacuolar protein sorting protein 35 (VPS35) gene has been 
identified to be linked to late onset familial Parkinson disease (PD). However, 
the pathophysiological roles of VPS35-D620N in PD remain unclear. Here, we 
generated the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans overexpressing either human wild 
type or PD-linked mutant VPS35-D620N in neurons. C. elegans expressing 
VPS35-D620N, compared with non-transgenic controls, showed movement disorders 
and dopaminergic neuron loss. VPS35-D620N worms displayed more swimming induced 
paralysis but showed no defects in BSR assays, thus indicating the disruption of 
dopamine (DA) recycling back inside neurons. Moreover, VPS35 formed a protein 
interaction complex with DA transporter (DAT), RAB5, RAB11 and FAM21. In 
contrast, the VPS35-D620N mutant destabilized these interactions, thus 
disrupting DAT transport from early endosomes to recycling endosomes, and 
decreasing DAT at the cell surface. These effects together increased DA in 
synaptic clefts, and led to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and motor 
dysfunction. Treatment with reserpine significantly decreased the swimming 
induced paralysis in VPS35-D620N worms, as compared with vehicle treated 
VPS35-D620N worms. Our studies not only provide novel insights into the 
mechanisms of VPS35-D620N-induced dopaminergic neuron degeneration and motor 
dysfunction via disruption of DAT function and the DA signaling pathway but also 
indicate a potential strategy to treat VPS35-D620N-related PD and other 
disorders.
