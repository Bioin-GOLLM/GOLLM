INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to study the role of the anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC)-dorsal midbrain striatum (DMS) in neuropathic pain in 
mice.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Optogenetics has been increasingly used in neuroscience 
research to selectively and precisely control the activity of a defined group of 
central neurons to determine their roles in behavioral functions in animals. The 
most important opsins are blue-sensitive ChR2 and yellow-sensitive NpHR. 
Calcium-calmodulin dependent protein kinase Iiα (CaMKIIα) is mostly expressed in 
the pyramidal excitatory neurons. Mice were injected with 
AAV2/9-CamKII-ChR2-mCherry, AAV2/9-CamKII-eNpHR3.0-GFP or AAV2/9-CamKII-mCherry 
virus in the ACC region, and the optical fiber implantation was performed in the 
ACC or DMS region. Mice were then followed up for 2 to 8 weeks and behavioral 
tests were carried out in the presence or absence of the blue/yellow light (473 
nm/589 nm). Pain behavioral tests with or without the blue/yellow light at the 
same time were performed on the third and the seventh day after the chronic 
constriction injury of sciatic nerve model (CCI) was established. The pain 
thresholds of left and right hind limbs of mice in all groups were measured.
RESULTS: No matter whether activating the neurons in ACC or DMS, compared with 
normal mice in the ChR2-off-right group, and the mCherry-on-right group, the 
thermal pain threshold and mechanical pain threshold of the normal mice in the 
ChR2-on-right group were significantly lower. When inhibiting the neurons in the 
ACC or DMS, on day 3 and day 7 after CCI operation, the thermal pain threshold 
and mechanical pain threshold of the CCI mice of the NpHR-on-right group were 
significantly higher compared with the NpHR-off-right and mCherry-on-right 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The anterior cingulate cortex-dorsal midbrain striatum may be 
involved in the regulation of neuropathic pain in mice.
