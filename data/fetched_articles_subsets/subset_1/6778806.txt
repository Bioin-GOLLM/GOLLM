The tryptic hydrolysate of Bence-Jones protein Wes (Mr = 23000) was separated by 
high-pressure liquid chromatography in a volatile buffer system on a 
reversed-phase column. From the resulting 22 peptides 18 yielded integer numbers 
after amino acid analysis. They could be used directly for a modified Edman 
degradation. Two peptides were not separated by this procedure, two were 
missing. Under different conditions these four peptides could also be prepared 
in pure form. 3 mg was sufficient to elucidate the primary structure of the 
variable part of this protein completely. The arrangement of the tryptic 
peptides was deduced by homology to other k=chains. Protein Wes contains 214 
residues and belongs to subgroup I of the k-chains. The valine residue in 
position 191 indicates that it belongs to allotype Inv b+.
