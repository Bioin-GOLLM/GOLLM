Glioblastomas are highly lethal brain tumors containing tumor-propagating glioma 
stem cells (GSCs). The molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of the 
GSC phenotype are not fully defined. Here we demonstrate that the zinc finger 
and X-linked transcription factor (ZFX) maintains GSC self-renewal and 
tumorigenic potential by upregulating c-Myc expression. ZFX is differentially 
expressed in GSCs relative to non-stem glioma cells and neural progenitor cells. 
Disrupting ZFX by shRNA reduced c-Myc expression and potently inhibited GSC 
self-renewal and tumor growth. Ectopic expression of c-Myc to its endogenous 
level rescued the effects caused by ZFX disruption, supporting that ZFX controls 
GSC properties through c-Myc. Furthermore, ZFX binds to a specific sequence 
(GGGCCCCG) on the human c-Myc promoter to upregulate c-Myc expression. These 
data demonstrate that ZFX functions as a critical upstream regulator of c-Myc 
and plays essential roles in the maintenance of the GSC phenotype. This study 
also supports that c-Myc is a dominant driver linking self-renewal to 
malignancy.
