Mapping genes for nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment may lead to 
identification of genes that are essential for the development and preservation 
of hearing. We studied a family with autosomal dominant, progressive, low 
frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Linkage analysis employing microsatellite 
polymorphic markers revealed a fully linked marker (D4S126) at 4p16.3, a 
gene-rich region containing IT15, the gene for Huntington's disease (HD). For 
D4S126, the logarithm-of-odds (lod) score was 3.64 at theta = 0, and the overall 
maximum lod score was 5.05 at theta = 0.05 for D4S412. Analysis of recombinant 
individuals maps the disease gene to a 1.7 million base pair (Mb) region between 
D4S412 and D4S432. Genes for two types of mutant mice with abnormal 
cochleovestibular function, tilted (tlt) and Bronx waltzer (bv), have been 
mapped to the syntenic region of human 4p16.3 on mouse chromosome 5. Further 
studies with the goals of cloning a gene for autosomal nonsyndromic hearing 
impairment and identifying the murine homologue may explain the role of this 
gene in the development and function of the cochlea.
