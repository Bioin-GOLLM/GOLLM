Nanobody (Nb) is a promising vector for targeted drug delivery. This study aims 
to identify an Nb that can specifically target the lung by binding human 
pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A). Human lung frozen tissue sections were 
used for 3 rounds of biospanning of our previously constructed Nb library for 
rat SP-A to establish a sub-library of Nb, which specifically bound human lung 
tissues. Phage-ELISA was performed to screen the sub-library to identify Nb4, 
which specifically bound human SP-A. The binding affinity Kd of Nb4 to 
recombinant human SP-A was 7.48 × 10-7 M. Nb4 (19 kDa) was stable at 30 °C-37 °C 
and pH 7.0-7.6 and specifically bound the SP-A in human lung tissue homogenates, 
human lung A549 cells, and human lung tissues, whereas didn't react with human 
liver L-02 cells, kidney 293T cells, and human tissues from organs other than 
the lung. Nb4 accumulated in the lung of nude mice 5 minutes after a tail vein 
injection of Nb4 and was excreted 3 hours. Short-term exposure (one month) to 
Nb4 didn't cause apparent liver and kidney toxicity in rats, whereas 3-month 
exposure resulted in mild liver and kidney injuries. Nb4 may be a promising 
vector to specifically deliver drugs to the lung.
