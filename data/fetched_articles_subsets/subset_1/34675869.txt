The role of muscle biopsy in the diagnostic workup of floppy infants is 
controversial. Muscle sampling is invasive, and often, results are not specific. 
The rapid expansion of genetic approach has made the muscle histopathology 
analysis less crucial. This study aims to assess the role and efficacy of muscle 
histopathology in the diagnostic algorithm of hypotonia in early infancy through 
a retrospective analysis of 197 infants who underwent muscle biopsy in their 
first 18 months of life. Data analysis revealed that 92/197 (46.7%) of muscle 
biopsies were non-specific (80) or normal (12), not allowing a specific 
diagnosis. In 41/197 (20.8%) cases, biopsy suggested a metabolic or 
mitochondrial myopathy, while in 23/197 cases (11.7%), we found evidence of 
muscular dystrophy. In 19/197 cases (9.7%), histopathology characteristics of a 
congenital myopathy were reported. In 22/197 cases (11.7%), the 
histopathological study indicated presence of a neurogenic damage. Overall, 46 
diagnoses were then achieved by oriented genetic tests. Muscle biopsy results 
were consistent with genetic results in 90% of cases. Diagnostic algorithms for 
the diagnosis of a floppy infant are largely missing. Muscle biopsy alone can 
lead to a diagnosis, help the clinician in the choice of a genetic test, or even 
modify a diagnosis made previously.
