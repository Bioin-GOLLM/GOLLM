Glia and accessory cells regulate the microenvironment around neurons and 
primary sensory cells. However, the impact of specific glial regulators of ions 
and solutes on functionally diverse primary cells is poorly understood. Here, we 
systemically investigate the requirement of ion channels and transporters 
enriched in Caenorhabditis elegans Amsh glia for the function of chemosensory 
neurons. Although Amsh glia ablated worms show reduced function of ASH, AWC, 
AWA, and ASE neurons, we show that the loss of glial enriched ion channels and 
transporters impacts these neurons differently, with nociceptor ASH being the 
most affected. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the importance of K+, Cl-, 
and nucleoside homeostasis in the Amphid sensory organ and uncovers the 
contribution of glial genes implicated in neurological disorders. Our findings 
build a unique fingerprint of each glial enriched ion channel and transporter 
and may provide insights into the function of supporting cells of mammalian 
sensory organs.
