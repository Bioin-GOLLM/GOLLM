BACKGROUND: Characterization of patient factors associated with istradefylline 
efficacy may facilitate personally optimized treatment.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine which patient factors are associated with 
favorable istradefylline treatment outcomes in PD patients with motor 
complications.
METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of data from two identical phase 2b and 
3 Japanese studies of istradefylline. Logistic regression models were used to 
assess the association of 12 patient characteristics with favorable outcomes.
RESULTS: Off time reduction and increased good on time with istradefylline 
provided a significantly favorable response in patients aged ≥65 years. Off time 
reduction was more favorable in patients with ≥8-hour daily off time at 
baseline. Improvement in UPDRS Part III was favorable in patients with UPDRS 
Part III baseline score ≥ 20.
CONCLUSIONS: Several patient factors influenced the effect of istradefylline on 
motor fluctuations, motor function, activities of daily living, and clinical 
impression. © 2020 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley
