The human c-H-ras1 gene contains within the first intron a p53 element, which 
functions as a transcriptional enhancer. Using nuclear extracts from human 
endometrial and ovarian tumours in gel retardation assays, we examined the 
binding levels of the P53 protein to the H-ras element in tumour versus the 
adjacent normal tissue. Elevated P53 binding in the tumour tissue was found in 
5/12 (42%) endometrial and in 2/5 (40%) ovarian specimens and these cases were 
found to overexpress wild-type P53. Loss of P53 binding to the H-ras element due 
to p53 mutations, was observed in 3/12 (25%) endometrial and in 1/5 (20%) 
ovarian cases. Similar P53 binding levels to the H-ras element were found in 
4/12 (33%) endometrial and in 2/5 (40%) ovarian pairs showing normal expression 
of wild-type P53. Overexpression of the Ras p21 protein correlated with elevated 
binding and increased nuclear levels of wild-type P53. Our results suggest that 
P53 protein alterations, participate in the development of human gynecological 
neoplasias through aberrant transcriptional regulation of the H-ras 
proto-oncogene.
