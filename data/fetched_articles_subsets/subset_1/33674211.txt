BACKGROUND: The CFTR modulator ivacaftor has been variably effective in treating 
individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) who harbor CFTR gating variants such as 
G551D, as well as other classes of CFTR variants when used with other 
modulators. Because CFTR genotype does not fully explain this variability, 
defining genetic modifiers of response to modulator therapy is of particular 
interest to the field of individualized CF drug therapy. Previous studies have 
proposed that a variant in SLC26A9 (rs7512462) is associated with lung disease 
severity and with response to treatment with ivacaftor in individuals with CF 
who carry G551D or gating variants.
METHODS: Given the implications for CF treatment, we re-examined the reported 
associations in three cohorts; patients enrolled in the Twin and Siblings study 
at Johns Hopkins University, the CF modifier study at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the prospective G551D Observational (GOAL) study. 
The GOAL study was specifically designed to measure lung function response to 
ivacaftor.
RESULTS: We find no association between SLC26A9 (rs7512462) genotype and lung 
disease severity (n = 272) or change in lung function at one-, three-, and 
six-month intervals following ivacaftor treatment(n = 141) in individuals with 
CF who carry at least one G551D variant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our inability to replicate this association indicates that 
rs7512462 genotype should not be used in treatment decisions.
