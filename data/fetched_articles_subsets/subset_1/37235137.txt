BACKGROUND & AIMS: Around 20% of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) are lean. Increasing evidence suggests that lean NAFLD is a unique 
subtype of the disease. We aimed to explore the metabolic profile, genetic 
basis, causal risk factors, and clinical sequelae underlying lean NAFLD.
METHODS: NAFLD was diagnosed by whole liver proton density fat fraction ≥5%. 
Whole liver proton density fat fraction and hepatic iron were quantified using 
magnetic resonance imaging in the UK Biobank. Individuals in this study were 
stratified according to the World Health Organization criteria of obesity, into 
lean, overweight, and obese. Mediation analysis, Mendelian randomisation 
analysis, and Bayesian networks were used to identify a risk factor or a 
clinical sequela of lean/obese NAFLD.
RESULTS: Lean NAFLD manifested a distinct metabolic profile, featured by 
elevated hepatic iron and fasting glucose. Four loci, namely, HFE rs1800562, 
SLC17A3-SLC17A2-TRIM38 rs9348697, PNPLA3 rs738409, and TM6SF2 rs58542926, were 
associated with lean NAFLD (p <5 × 10-8). HFE rs1800562 was specifically 
associated with lean NAFLD and demonstrated a significant mediation effect 
through elevating hepatic iron. Type 2 diabetes was the most pronounced clinical 
sequela of lean NAFLD, followed by liver cirrhosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that HFE plays a potential steatogenic role 
rather than regulating iron homoeostasis in patients with lean NAFLD. The 
increased liver iron deposition is associated with lean NAFLD, whereas obese 
NAFLD is not related to hepatic iron. The clinical management of patients with 
lean NAFLD shall be concerned with the prevention and treatment of type 2 
diabetes and liver cirrhosis.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Lean NAFLD has a distinct natural history from obese 
NAFLD. This study underscored liver iron content and the genetic variant of the 
iron homoeostasis gene HFE as major risks of lean NAFLD, in addition to the 
unique metabolic profile. The development of type 2 diabetes or liver cirrhosis 
shall be closely monitored and prevented in patients with lean NAFLD.
