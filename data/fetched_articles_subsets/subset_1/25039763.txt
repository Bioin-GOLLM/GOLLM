Posttranslational modifications (PTM) including glycosylation, phosphorylation, 
acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination dynamically alter the proteome. The 
evolutionarily conserved enzymes O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) 
transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase are responsible for the addition and removal, 
respectively, of the nutrient-sensitive PTM of protein serine and threonine 
residues with O-GlcNAc. Indeed, the O-GlcNAc modification acts at every step in 
the "central dogma" of molecular biology and alters signaling pathways leading 
to amplified or blunted biological responses. The cellular roles of OGT and the 
dynamic PTM O-GlcNAc have been clarified with recently developed chemical tools 
including high-throughput assays, structural and mechanistic studies and potent 
enzyme inhibitors. These evolving chemical tools complement genetic and 
biochemical approaches for exposing the underlying biological information 
conferred by O-GlcNAc cycling.
