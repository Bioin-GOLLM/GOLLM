Previous studies indicate that eating behaviours and food cravings are 
associated with increased BMI and obesity. However, the interaction between 
these behaviours and other variables such as age, sex, BMI and genetics is 
complex. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between eating 
behaviours and food cravings, and to examine the influence of age, sex, body 
mass index (BMI) and fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) genotype on these 
relationships. A total of 475 participants (252 female, 223 male, BMI: 25.82 ± 
6.14 kg/m², age: 30.65 ± 14.20 years) completed the revised 18-question version 
of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R18) to assess cognitive 
restraint, uncontrolled eating and emotional eating, and the Food Cravings 
Inventory (FCI) to assess cravings for fatty food, sweet food, carbohydrates and 
fast food. DNA samples were genotyped for the rs9939609 polymorphism in the 
obesity-linked gene FTO. Questionnaire data was analysed for associations 
between the TFEQ-R18 and FCI subscales for the whole study group, and the group 
divided by sex, genotype and age (≤25 years versus >25 years). Finally, 
mediation analysis was used to explore the relationships between BMI, cognitive 
restraint and food cravings. FTO AA + AT genotype was associated with increased 
BMI, but not with differences in eating behavior scores or food craving scores; 
age was associated with increased BMI and decreases in food craving scores in 
which this effect was stronger in women compared to men. Increased cognitive 
restraint was associated with decreased food craving scores in the ≤25 years 
group. Mediation analysis demonstrated that in this group the association 
between BMI and reduced food cravings was mediated by cognitive restraint 
indicating that in this age group individuals use cognitive restraint to control 
their food cravings. The positive correlation between age and BMI confirms 
previous results but the findings of this study show that age, sex, FTO genotype 
and BMI have an influence on the relationships between eating behaviours and 
food cravings and that these variables interact.
