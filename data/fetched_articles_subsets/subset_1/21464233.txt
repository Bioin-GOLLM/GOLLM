Runx1 controls hematopoietic stem cell emergence and hair follicle stem cell 
(HFSC) activation and proliferation in adult skin. Here we use lineage tracing 
and mouse genetic manipulation to address the role of Runx1 in the embryonic 
development of HFSCs. We find Runx1 is expressed in distinct classes of 
embryonic skin precursors for short-term HF progenitors, adult HFSCs, and 
mesenchymal progenitors. Runx1 acts in the embryonic epithelium for timely 
emergence of adult HFSCs and short-term progenitors, but is dispensable for both 
of them. In contrast, Runx1 is strictly needed in the embryonic mesenchyme for 
proper adult HFSC differentiation and long-term skin integrity. Our data 
implicate Runx1 in epithelial cell adhesion and migration and in regulation of 
paracrine epithelial-mesenchymal cross talk. The latter involves Lef1 and Wnt 
signaling modulation in opposing directions from two distinct skin compartments. 
Thus, a master regulator of hematopoiesis also controls HFSC emergence and 
maintenance via modulation of bidirectional cross talking between nascent stem 
cells and their niche.
