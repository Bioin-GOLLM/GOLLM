In animals, stress and corticosteroid excess are associated with decreases in 
memory performance and hippocampal volume that may be prevented with agents that 
decrease glutamate release. Humans also demonstrate changes in memory and 
hippocampus with corticosteroids. In this report the effects of 
glutamate-release inhibitor lamotrigine on hippocampal structure and memory were 
examined in people receiving medically needed prescription corticosteroid 
therapy. A total of 54 outpatient adults (n = 28 women) receiving chronic (≥ 6 
months) oral corticosteroid therapy were randomized to lamotrigine or placebo 
for 48 weeks. Declarative memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal 
Learning Test (RAVLT); structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as 
single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS) focused on hippocampus were obtained 
at baseline and week 48. Utilizing a mixed-model approach, structural and 
biochemical data were examined by separate ANOVAs, and memory was assessed with 
a multi-level longitudinal model. RAVLT total scores demonstrated significantly 
better declarative memory performance with lamotrigine than placebo (p = 0.047). 
Hippocampal subfield volumes were not significantly different between the 
treatment groups. In summary, lamotrigine was associated with less decline in 
declarative memory performance than placebo in corticosteroid-treated patients. 
Findings suggest that, in humans as well as in animal models, glutamate release 
inhibitors may attenuate some of the effects on the human memory associated with 
corticosteroids.
