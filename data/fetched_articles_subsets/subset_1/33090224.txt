IMPORTANCE: The ε2 and ε4 alleles of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene are 
associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) risk. Although nearby genetic variants 
have also been shown to be associated with AD, including rs2075650 in the TOMM40 
gene and rs4420638 near the APOC1 gene, it is unknown whether these associations 
are independent of the ε2 and ε4 alleles.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether variants near APOE are associated with AD 
independently of the ε2/ε3/ε4 genotype.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this genetic association study of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium imputed genotype at data, 14 415 
variants near APOE (±500 kilobase) for 18 795 individuals with European ancestry 
were tested for association with AD using 4 logistic mixed models adjusting for 
sex, cohort, population structure, and relatedness. Model 1 had no APOE 
adjustment, and model 2 adjusted for the count of ε2 and ε4 alleles. Model 3 was 
restricted to ε3 homozygotes, and model 4 was restricted to ε4 homozygotes. Data 
were downloaded from May 31, 2018, to June 3, 2018, and analyzed from November 
1, 2018, to June 24, 2020.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Alzheimer disease affectation status was defined by 
clinicians using standard National Institute of Neurological and Communicative 
Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association 
criteria. Association was evaluated using Score tests; results with P < .05 
divided by the number of independent tests per model were considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS: Among the 18 795 individuals in the study, 9704 were affected by AD and 
9066 were control individuals; the median age at onset/evaluation was 76 
(interquartile range, 70-82) years; and 11 167 were female (59.4%). Associations 
with AD were found for rs2075650 (odds ratio [OR], 2.59; 95% CI, 2.45-2.75; 
P = 3.19 × 10-228) and rs4420638 (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.62-2.94; 
P = 2.99 × 10-254) without APOE adjustment. Although rs2075650 was nominally 
associated with AD among the ε4 homozygotes (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00-1.77; 
P = .047), the association between rs4420638 and AD was eliminated by APOE 
adjustment (model 2 OR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.96-1.18; P = .24]; model 3 OR, 1.13 [95% 
CI, 0.95-1.34; P = .18]; model 4 OR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.56-1.45; P = .66]). There 
was a significant association between rs192879175 and AD among ε3 homozygotes 
(OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37-0.68; P = 8.30 × 10-6).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this genetic association study suggest 
that ε2/ε3/ε4 alleles are not the only variants in the APOE region that are 
associated with AD risk. Additional work with independent data is needed to 
replicate these results.
