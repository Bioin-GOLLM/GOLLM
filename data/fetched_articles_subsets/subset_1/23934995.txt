We describe a series of CEN/ARS episomal plasmids containing different Candida 
glabrata promoters, allowing for a range of constitutive or regulated expression 
of proteins in C. glabrata. The set of promoters includes three constitutive 
promoters (EGD2pr, HHT2pr, PDC1pr), two macrophage/phagocytosis-induced 
promoters (ACO2pr, LYS21pr), and one nutritionally regulated promoter (MET3pr). 
Each promoter was cloned into two plasmid backbones that differ in their 
selectable marker, URA3, or the dominant-selectable NAT1 gene, which confers 
resistance to the drug nourseothricin. Expression from the 12 resulting plasmids 
was assessed using GFP as a reporter and flow cytometry or quantitative 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to assess expression levels. 
Together this set of plasmids expands the toolkit of expression vectors 
available for use with C. glabrata.
