BACKGROUND: Hypoglycemia varies between patients with type 1 diabetes and is the 
main obstacle to therapy intensification. We investigated known and potential 
risk factors for hypoglycemia in subjects with type 1 diabetes.
METHOD: In the ASPIRE In-Home study (NCT01497938), a randomized trial of the 
threshold suspend (TS) feature of sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) therapy, 
subjects' propensity to nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH) was established in a 2-week 
run-in phase and assessed in a 3-month study phase via continuous glucose 
monitoring. Categorical variables were tested for association with NH rates in 
both phases.
RESULTS: Elevated rates of NH were significantly associated with baseline A1C 
≤7%, with bolus insulin deliveries unassisted by the bolus estimation 
calculator, and with assignment to the control group during the study phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of the TS feature and the bolus estimation calculator 
are strategies that may reduce the risk of NH.
