Gene mutations may affect the fate of many tumors including prostate cancer 
(PCa); therefore, the research of specific mutations associated with tumor 
outcomes might help the urologist to identify the best therapy for PCa patients 
such as surgical resection, adjuvant therapy or active surveillance. Genomic DNA 
(gDNA) was extracted from 48 paraffin-embedded PCa samples and normal paired 
tissues. Next, gDNA was amplified and analyzed by next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) using a specific gene panel for PCa. Raw data were refined to exclude 
false-positive mutations; thus, variants with coverage and frequency lower than 
100× and 5%, respectively were removed. Mutation significance was processed by 
Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling, ClinVar, and Varsome tools. Most of 3000 
mutations (80%) were single nucleotide variants and the remaining 20% indels. 
After raw data elaboration, 312 variants were selected. Most mutated genes were 
KMT2D (26.45%), FOXA1 (16.13%), ATM (15.81%), ZFHX3 (9.35%), TP53 (8.06%), and 
APC (5.48%). Hot spot mutations in FOXA1, ATM, ZFHX3, SPOP, and MED12 were also 
found. Truncating mutations of ATM, lesions lying in hot spot regions of SPOP 
and FOXA1 as well as mutations of TP53 correlated with poor prognosis. 
Importantly, we have also found some germline mutations associated with 
hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome. gDNA sequencing of 48 cancer tissues by 
NGS allowed to detect new tumor variants as well as confirmed lesions in genes 
linked to prostate cancer. Overall, somatic and germline mutations linked to 
good/poor prognosis could represent new prognostic tools to improve the 
management of PCa patients.
