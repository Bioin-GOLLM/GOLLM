Lycophytes are a key group for understanding vascular plant evolution. Lycophyte 
plastomes are highly distinct, indicating a dynamic evolutionary history, but 
detailed evaluation is hindered by the limited availability of sequences. Eight 
diverse plastomes were sequenced to assess variation in structure and functional 
content across lycophytes. Lycopodiaceae plastomes have remained largely 
unchanged compared with the common ancestor of land plants, whereas plastome 
evolution in Isoetes and especially Selaginella is highly dynamic. Selaginella 
plastomes have the highest GC content and fewest genes and introns of any 
photosynthetic land plant. Uniquely, the canonical inverted repeat was converted 
into a direct repeat (DR) via large-scale inversion in some Selaginella species. 
Ancestral reconstruction identified additional putative transitions between an 
inverted and DR orientation in Selaginella and Isoetes plastomes. A DR 
orientation does not disrupt the activity of copy-dependent repair to suppress 
substitution rates within repeats. Lycophyte plastomes include the most archaic 
examples among vascular plants and the most reconfigured among land plants. 
These evolutionary trends correlate with the mitochondrial genome, suggesting 
shared underlying mechanisms. Copy-dependent repair for DR-localized genes 
indicates that recombination and gene conversion are not inhibited by the DR 
orientation. Gene relocation in lycophyte plastomes occurs via overlapping 
inversions rather than transposase/recombinase-mediated processes.
