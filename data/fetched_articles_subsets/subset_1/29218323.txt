The dendritic tree is a key determinant of neuronal information processing. In 
the motor system, the dendritic tree of spinal cord neurons undergoes dramatic 
remodeling in an activity-dependent manner during early postnatal life. This 
leads to the proper segmental spinal cord connectivity that subserves normal 
locomotor behavior. One molecular system driving the establishment of dendrite 
architecture of mammalian motor neurons relies on AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs) 
assembled with the GluA1 subunit, and this occurs in an NMDA receptor 
(NMDA-R)-independent manner. The dendrite growth promoting activity of 
GluA1-containing AMPA-Rs depends on its intracellular binding partner, SAP97, 
and SAP97's PDZ3 domain. We show here that cysteine-rich interactor of PDZ3 
(CRIPT) is a bona fide SAP97 PDZ3-domain binding partner, localizes to synapses 
with GluA1 and SAP97 along the dendritic tree, and is a determinant of the 
dendritic growth of mammalian spinal cord neurons. We further show that CRIPT 
has a well-conserved ortholog in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, and 
animals lacking CRIPT display decreased dendrite branching of the well-studied 
PVD neuron in vivo. The lack of CRIPT leads to a selective defect in touch 
perception, and this is rescued by expression of wild-type (WT) human CRIPT 
(hCRIPT) in the nervous system. This work brings new light into the molecular 
machinery that drives dendritic growth during development and may prove relevant 
to the promotion of nervous system plasticity following insult.
