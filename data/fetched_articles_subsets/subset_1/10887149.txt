The molecular basis of a novel congenital afibrinogenemia has been determined. 
The proposita, the only affected member in a consanguineous Norwegian family, 
suffers from a moderate to severe bleeding disorder due to the total absence of 
any detectable fibrinogen. Dot blots of solubilized platelets revealed a small 
amount of gamma chain but no A alpha or B beta chains, whereas no chains were 
detected in plasma dot blots. DNA sequencing of the A alpha chain gene revealed 
a homozygous C-->T transversion 557 nucleotides from the transcription 
initiation site. This nucleotide change predicts the nonsense mutation A alpha 
149 Arg (CGA)-->stop (TGA). Early truncation of the A alpha chain appears to 
result in defective assembly or secretion of fibrinogen, probably due to the 
removal of the C-terminal disulfide ring residues that are critically required 
for the formation of a stable 3-chained half molecule. (Blood. 2000;96:773-775)
