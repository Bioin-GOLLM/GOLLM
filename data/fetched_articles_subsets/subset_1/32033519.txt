The genetic variant A1 of bovine β-casein (β-Cn) presents a His residue at a 
position 67 of the mature protein. This feature makes the Ile66-His67 bond more 
vulnerable to enzymatic cleavage, determining the release of the peptide β-Cn 
f(60-66), named β-casomorphin 7 (BCM7). BCM7 is an opioid-agonist for μ 
receptors, and it has been hypothesized to be involved in the development of 
different non-transmissible diseases in humans. In the last decade, studies have 
provided additional results on the potential health impact of β-Cn A1 and BCM7. 
These studies, here reviewed, highlighted a relation between the consumption of 
β-Cn A1 (and its derivative BCM7) and the increase of inflammatory response as 
well as discomfort at the gastrointestinal level. Conversely, the role of BCM7 
and the effects of ingestion of β-Cn A1 on the onset or worsening of other 
non-transmissible diseases as caused or favored by still need proof of evidence. 
Overall, the reviewed literature demonstrates that the "β-Cn A1/BCM7 issue" 
remains an intriguing but not exhaustively explained topic in human nutrition. 
On this basis, policies in favor of breeding for β-Cn variants not releasing 
BCM7 and consumption of "A1-like" milk appear not yet sound for a healthier and 
safer nutrition.
