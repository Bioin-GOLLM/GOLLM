BACKGROUND: To describe the free intervention strategy of thalassemia for 
childbearing couples in Guangzhou.
METHODS: Routine hematology examinations were conducted for 137,222 couples. 
Among them, 37,501 couples who had mean corpuscular volume (MCV) <82 fL or mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin <27 pg were elected for Hb analysis and the deletions of 
four common α-thalassemia mutation. Reverse dot blot for common nondeletional 
α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia was selectively used. Three thousand twenty-two 
couples randomly selected were offered all those tests as a control group. 
Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and 
next-generation sequencing were used for rare thalassemia. High-risk couples 
were offered prenatal diagnosis at 10-13 weeks' gestation based on informed 
consent.
RESULTS: The carrier rates of α-, β-, and αβ-thalassemia and δβ 
thalassemia/deletional HPFH were 7.7%, 3.02%, 0.5% and 0.059% respectively. Of 
them, 1.37% were identified as at-risk couples and 345 couples terminated the 
pregnancy. No severe α- and β-thalassemia births were observed. In the control 
group, two β- thalassemia carriers and one case with -α3.7 /ααQS were 
misdiagnosed, but all at-risk couples were found, and we could save 1,523,774 ¥ 
using our strategy. The cut-off points of 73.46 fL and 23.25 pg would be useful 
to find -α+ /αT thalassemia.
CONCLUSION: The intervention strategy was cost-effective and offered reference 
in population thalassemia screening.
