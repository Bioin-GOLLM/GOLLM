Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms that 
progressively worsen with age. Pathologically, PD is characterized by the 
aggregation of Î±-synuclein in cells of the substantia nigra in the brain and 
loss of dopaminergic neurons. This pathology is associated with impaired 
movement and reduced cognitive function. The etiology of PD can be attributed to 
a combination of environmental and genetic factors. A popular animal model, the 
nematode roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, has been frequently used to study the 
role of genetic and environmental factors in the molecular pathology and 
behavioral phenotypes associated with PD. The current review summarizes cellular 
markers and behavioral phenotypes in transgenic and toxin-induced PD models of 
C. elegans.
