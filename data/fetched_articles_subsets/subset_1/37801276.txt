OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex disorder influenced by 
genetic and environmental factors. This case-control study investigated the 
association between Sirtuin SIRT3 gene polymorphisms, serum malondialdehyde 
(MDA) levels, and CAD susceptibility.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 70 CAD cases and 30 controls at the 
Cardiac Center, Azadi Teaching Hospital, Duhok, Iraq. Genomic DNA was extracted, 
and PCR-based allele genotyping determined SIRT3 rs11246029 T/C polymorphisms. 
Serum MDA levels were measured using ELISA. Statistical analysis included 
t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, and Spearman correlations. Odds ratios (OR) with 
95% confidence intervals (CI) assessed genotypes/alleles and CAD associations. 
The accuracy of serum MDA in predicting the severity of CAD was evaluated using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: There were no significant variations in serum MDA levels between 
controls and CAD patients in the study. The diagnostic accuracy of serum MDA for 
CAD severity prediction was modest (Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.56). Correlations 
revealed associations between MDA and total bilirubin (negative) and Troponin 
(positive). CRP correlated positively with LDH, glucose, cholesterol, LDL, CKmB, 
and Troponin. CKmB and Troponin are positively associated with clinical 
characteristics. Genotype analysis identified a significantly higher CAD risk 
with the CC genotype compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: These findings shed light on the potential role of SIRT3 gene 
polymorphisms and serum MDA levels in CAD susceptibility. Further research is 
needed to understand underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications based on 
these markers.
