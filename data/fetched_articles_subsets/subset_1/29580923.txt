OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate our previous genetic 
association findings related to the endoglin (ENG) pathway from an American 
Caucasian preeclampsia cohort in independent preeclampsia cohorts. We also 
sought to explore the ENG pathway for new genetic associations in these 
independent cohorts.
STUDY DESIGN: We used a tagging single nucleotide (tSNP) approach to assess 
genetic variability across five ENG pathway genes (ENG, TGFβ1, TGFβR1, ALK1, and 
TGFβR2) in a Caucasian cohort from Norway (n = 77 preeclampsia cases & n = 63 
normotensive controls) and a White Hispanic cohort from Southern California 
(n = 69 preeclampsia cases & n = 106 normotensive controls).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Univariate analyses (Chi Square, Fisher's Exact) and 
multivariate logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the association 
between tSNP genotype distributions and pregnancy outcome in each cohort. 
Logistic regression models were adjusted for maternal age at delivery, infant 
sex, parity, smoking during pregnancy, and pre-pregnancy BMI.
RESULTS: Although we were unable to replicate our previous SNP-specific findings 
(ENG rs11792480, rs10121110; TGFβR2 rs6550005; p's > 0.05), we found that 
genetic variation in TGFβR1[ALK5] (rs6478974) and TGFβR2 (rs11129420, rs6802220, 
rs1155708, rs3773640, rs3773663) was significantly associated with preeclampsia 
in the Norwegian cohort and genetic variation in ALK1 (rs706819) and TGFβR2 
(rs9843942) was significantly associated with preeclampsia in the Latina cohort.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results provide further support for the involvement and 
investigation of the endoglin pathway in preeclampsia.
