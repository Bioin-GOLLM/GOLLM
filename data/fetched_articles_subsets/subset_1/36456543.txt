Pili are filamentous surface extensions that play roles in bacterial and 
archaeal cellular processes such as adhesion, biofilm formation, motility, 
cell-cell communication, DNA uptake and horizontal gene transfer. The model 
archaeaon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius assembles three filaments of the type-IV 
pilus superfamily (archaella, archaeal adhesion pili and UV-inducible pili), as 
well as a so-far uncharacterised fourth filament, named "thread". Here, we 
report on the cryo-EM structure of the archaeal thread. The filament is highly 
glycosylated and consists of subunits of the protein Saci_0406, arranged in a 
head-to-tail manner. Saci_0406 displays structural similarity, but low sequence 
homology, to bacterial type-I pilins. Thread subunits are interconnected via 
donor strand complementation, a feature reminiscent of bacterial chaperone-usher 
pili. However, despite these similarities in overall architecture, archaeal 
threads appear to have evolved independently and are likely assembled by a 
distinct mechanism.
