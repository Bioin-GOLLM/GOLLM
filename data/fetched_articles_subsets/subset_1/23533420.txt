The standard procedure for definitive detection of BoNT-producing Clostridia is 
a culture method combined with neurotoxin detection using a standard mouse 
bioassay (MBA). The mouse bioassay is highly sensitive and specific, but it is 
expensive and time-consuming, and there are ethical concerns due to use of 
laboratory animals. Cell-based assays provide an alternative to the MBA in 
screening for BoNT-producing Clostridia. Here, we describe a cell-based assay 
utilizing a fluorescence reporter construct expressed in a neuronal cell model 
to study toxin activity in situ. Our data indicates that the assay can detect as 
little as 100â€‰pM BoNT/A activity within living cells, and the assay is currently 
being evaluated for the analysis of BoNT in food matrices. Among available in 
vitro assays, we believe that cell-based assays are widely applicable in 
high-throughput screenings and have the potential to at least reduce and refine 
animal assays if not replace it.
