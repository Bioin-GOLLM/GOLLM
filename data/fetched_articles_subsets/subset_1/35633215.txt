INTRODUCTION: Essential thrombocythemia, a myeloproliferative condition with an 
increased number of circulating platelets, is a rare hematological malignancy. 
The aim of the study is to find out the prevalence of essential thrombocythemia 
among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms presenting in haematology unit 
of a tertiary care centre.
METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study at a tertiary care centre 
from September, 2020 to September, 2021 (Reference number: 48 (6-11) E2077/076). 
All the patients with a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia and willing to 
give consent were included in the study while the patients with incomplete 
investigations were excluded. A sample size of 72 patients was taken and 
convenience sampling was done. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2010 and 
analysis was done by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 
22.0. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with 
frequency and proportion for binary data along with mean and standard deviation 
for continuous data.
RESULTS: Among 72 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, the prevalence of 
essential thrombocythemia was found to be 17 (23.61%) (13.80-33.42 at a 95% 
Confidence Interval). The mean age of patients was 55.41±11.20 years with a male 
to female ratio of 9:8. The mean hemoglobin level and platelet count in patients 
were found to be 11.20±2.1 g/dl and 677000±262067.70 cells/mm3. Twelve (70.58%) 
of total patients were under low risk of essential thrombocythemia while 3 
(17.64%) of them were at high risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of essential thrombocythemia was similar to other 
studies done in similar settings.
