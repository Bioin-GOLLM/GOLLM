During mammalian brain development, neural progenitor cells proliferate 
extensively but can ensure the production of correct numbers of various types of 
mature cells by balancing symmetric proliferative versus asymmetric 
differentiative cell divisions. This process of cell fate determination may be 
harnessed for developing cancer therapy. Here, we test this idea by targeting 
KIF20A, a mitotic kinesin crucial for the control of cell division modes, in a 
genetic model of medulloblastoma (MB) and human MB cells. Inducible Kif20a 
knockout in both normal and MB-initiating granule neuron progenitors (GNPs) 
causes early cell cycle exit and precocious neuronal differentiation without 
causing cytokinesis failure and suppresses the development of Sonic Hedgehog 
(SHH)-activated MB. Inducible KIF20A knockdown in human MB cells inhibits 
proliferation both in cultures and in growing tumors. Our results indicate that 
targeting the fate specification process of nascent daughter cells presents a 
novel avenue for developing anti-proliferation treatment for malignant brain 
tumors.
