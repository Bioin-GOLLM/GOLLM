Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and 
invasion, fostering an inflammation-enriched microenvironment that facilitates 
angiogenesis and immune evasion. However, the PGE2 receptor subtype (EP1-EP4) 
involved in neuroblastoma (NB) growth remains elusive. Herein, we show that the 
EP2 receptor highly correlates with NB aggressiveness and acts as a predominant 
Gαs-coupled receptor mediating PGE2-initiated cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in NB 
cells with high-risk factors, including 11q deletion and MYCN amplification. 
Knockout of EP2 in NB cells blocks the development of xenografts, and its 
conditional knockdown prevents established tumors from progressing. 
Pharmacological inhibition of EP2 by our recently developed antagonist TG6-129 
suppresses the growth of NB xenografts in nude mice and syngeneic allografts in 
immunocompetent hosts, accompanied by anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and 
apoptotic effects. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the PGE2/EP2 
signaling pathway contributes to NB malignancy and that EP2 inhibition by our 
drug-like compounds provides a promising strategy to treat this deadly pediatric 
cancer.
