Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 3 (M3 receptor) is a G Protein-Coupled 
Receptor (GPCR) that mediates many important physiological functions. Currently, 
most M3 receptor drugs also have high affinity for other subtypes of muscarinic 
acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and produce the risk of side effects. 
Therefore, in order to find M3 receptor drugs with high specificity, high 
activity and low side effects, we established a cell model and method for 
efficient and sensitive screening of M3 receptor based on calcium-activated 
chloride channels (CaCCs), and this method is also suitable for the screening of 
other GPCR drugs. This screening model consists of Fischer rat thyroid 
follicular epithelial (FRT) cells that endogenously express M3 receptors, CaCCs, 
and the indicator YFP-H148Q/I152L. We verified that the model can sensitively 
detect changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration using fluorescence quenching 
kinetics experiments, confirmed the screening function of the model by applying 
available M3 receptor drugs, and also evaluated the good performance of the 
model in high-throughput screening.
