BACKGROUND: Mutations in the ryanodine type 1 receptor (RyR1) are causative for 
malignant hyperthermia. Studies in human B lymphocytes have shown that 
measurement of RyR1-mediated intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(i)) release can 
differentiate between normal and malignant hyperthermia-susceptible individuals. 
The authors have further developed the B-cell assay by pharmacologically 
characterizing RyR1-mediated Ca release in two normal human B-cell lines and 
demonstrating increased sensitivity of lymphocytes to the RyR1 agonist 
4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC) in the porcine model of MH.
METHODS: Ca(2+)(i) was measured fluorometrically using fura-2 in populations of 
cells in suspension or with fluo-4 in single cells using confocal microscopy. 
The Dakiki and PP normal human B cell lines were used, as well as lymphocytes 
obtained from normal and malignant hyperthermia-susceptible pigs. 4-CmC was used 
to elicit RyR1-mediated Ca release; all experiments were performed in the 
absence of external Ca(2+).
RESULTS: EC(50) values for 4-CmC were 0.98 and 1.04 mm for Dakiki and PP cells, 
respectively, demonstrating reproducibility. The 4-CmC-induced increase in 
Ca(2+)(i) was eliminated by thapsigargin and was unaffected by xestospongin C. 
The Ca(2+)(i) increase was separable from mitochondrial stores and was inhibited 
by azumolene. Caffeine did not induce Ca(2+)(i) release, but ryanodine depleted 
intracellular stores by 50%. Lymphocytes from pigs carrying the Arg614Cys 
mutation in RyR1 showed increased sensitivity to 4-CmC (EC(50) = 0.47 vs. 0.81 
mm for cells derived from normal animals).
CONCLUSIONS: RyR1-mediated Ca(2+) signals can be pharmacologically distinguished 
from other intracellular sources in human B cells, and alterations of RyR1 
function can be successfully detected using Ca(2+) release from intracellular 
stores as an end point.
