Cancer arises from malignant cells that exist in dynamic multilevel interactions 
with the host tissue. Cancer therapies aiming to directly kill cancer cells, 
including oncogene-targeted therapy and immune-checkpoint therapy that revives 
tumour-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are effective in some patients1,2, but 
acquired resistance frequently develops3,4. An alternative therapeutic strategy 
aims to rectify the host tissue pathology, including abnormalities in the 
vasculature that foster cancer progression5,6; however, neutralization of 
proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) has 
had limited clinical benefits7,8. Here, following the finding that transforming 
growth factor-β (TGF-β) suppresses T helper 2 (TH2)-cell-mediated cancer 
immunity9, we show that blocking TGF-β signalling in CD4+ T cells remodels the 
tumour microenvironment and restrains cancer progression. In a mouse model of 
breast cancer resistant to immune-checkpoint or anti-VEGF therapies10,11, 
inducible genetic deletion of the TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2) in CD4+ T cells 
suppressed tumour growth. For pharmacological blockade, we engineered a 
bispecific receptor decoy by attaching the TGF-β-neutralizing TGFBR2 
extracellular domain to ibalizumab, a non-immunosuppressive CD4 antibody12,13, 
and named it CD4 TGF-β Trap (4T-Trap). Compared with a non-targeted TGF-β-Trap, 
4T-Trap selectively inhibited TH cell TGF-β signalling in tumour-draining lymph 
nodes, causing reorganization of tumour vasculature and cancer cell death, a 
process dependent on the TH2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). Notably, the 
4T-Trap-induced tumour tissue hypoxia led to increased VEGFA expression. VEGF 
inhibition enhanced the starvation-triggered cancer cell death and amplified the 
antitumour effect of 4T-Trap. Thus, targeted TGF-β signalling blockade in helper 
T cells elicits an effective tissue-level cancer defence response that can 
provide a basis for therapies directed towards the cancer environment.
