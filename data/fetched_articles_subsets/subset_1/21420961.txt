Human glucokinase (GK) plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. An E339K 
mutation in GK was recently found to be associated with hyperglycemia. It showed 
lower enzyme activity and impaired protein stability compared to the wild-type 
enzyme. Here, we present the crystal structure of E339K GK in complex with 
glucose. This mutation results in a conformational change of His416, spatially 
interfering with adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) binding. Furthermore, Ser411 at 
the ATP binding site is phosphorylated and then hydrogen bonded with Thr82, 
physically blocking the ATP binding. These findings provide structural basis for 
the reduced activity of this mutant.
