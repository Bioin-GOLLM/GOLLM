The mitochondrial aconitase gene (ACO2) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the 
conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Biallelic 
variants in ACO2 are purported to cause two distinct disorders: infantile 
cerebellar-retinal degeneration (ICRD) which is characterized by CNS 
abnormalities, neurodevelopmental phenotypes, optic atrophy and retinal 
degeneration; and optic atrophy 9 (OPA9), characterized by isolated 
ophthalmologic phenotypes including optic atrophy and low vision. However, some 
doubt remains as to whether biallelic ACO2 variants can cause isolated 
ophthalmologic phenotypes. A review of the literature revealed five individuals 
from three families who carry biallelic ACO2 variants whose phenotypes are 
consistent with OPA9. Here, we describe a brother and sister with OPA9 who are 
compound heterozygous for novel missense variants in ACO2; c.[487G>T];[1894G>A], 
p.[(Val163Leu)];[(Val632Met)]. A review of pathogenic ACO2 variants revealed 
that those associated with OPA9 are distinct from those associated with ICRD. 
Missense variants associated with either OPA9 or ICRD do not cluster in distinct 
ACO2 domains, making it difficult to predict the severity of a variant based on 
position alone. We conclude that biallelic variants in ACO2 can cause the milder 
OPA9 phenotype, and that the OPA9-related ACO2 variants identified to date are 
distinct from those that cause ICRD.
