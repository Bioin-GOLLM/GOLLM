Influenza virus infection is a global public health issue. The effectiveness of 
antiviral therapies for influenza has been limited by the emergence of 
drug-resistant viral strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify 
novel antiviral therapies. Here we tested the effects of 300 traditional Chinese 
medicines on the replication of various influenza virus strains in a lung cell 
line, A549, using an influenza-specific luciferase reporter assay. Of the 
traditional medicines tested, Polygonum cuspidatum (PC) and its active 
components, resveratrol and emodin, were found to attenuate influenza viral 
replication in A549 cells. Furthermore, they preferentially inhibited the 
replication of influenza A virus, including clinical strains isolated in 2009 
and 2011 in Taiwan and the laboratory strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1). In addition to 
inhibiting the expression of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, PC, emodin, and 
resveratrol also increased the expression of interferon beta (IFN-β) through 
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Moreover, the anti-viral activity of IFN-β or 
resveratrol was reduced when the A549 cells were treated with neutralizing 
anti-IFN-β antibodies or a TLR9 inhibitor, suggesting that IFN-β likely acts 
synergistically with resveratrol to inhibit H1N1 replication. This potential 
antiviral mechanism, involving direct inhibition of virus replication and 
simultaneous activation of the host immune response, has not been previously 
described for a single antiviral molecule. In conclusion, our data support the 
use of PC, resveratrol or emodin for inhibiting influenza virus replication 
directly and via TLR-9-induced IFN-β production.
