d-serine has been observed in submandibular gland tissue in rats, but its 
functions remain to be clarified. Oral administration of d-serine, but not 
l-serine, increased its concentrations in the submandibular gland and 
pilocarpine-induced salivary secretion. In vivo microdialysis was used to 
collect the d- and l-enantiomers of amino acids from local interstitial fluid in 
the rat submandibular gland. The proportion of the d-form of serine in 
interstitial fluid was higher than that in plasma or saliva. Perfusion of the 
rat submandibular gland with d-serine and l-glutamic acid via the submandibular 
gland artery resulted in a significant increase in salivary secretion after 
stimulation of muscarinic receptors with carbachol. In vivo microdialysis 
applied to the submandibular glands of rats showed that infusion of d-serine 
along with l-glutamate through the microdialysis probe significantly elevated 
acetylcholine levels in local interstitial fluids in the submandibular glands of 
anesthetized rats as compared to that with l-glutamate alone in an 
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor glycine site antagonist-sensitive manner. These 
results indicate that d-serine augments salivary secretion by increasing 
acetylcholine release in the salivary glands.
