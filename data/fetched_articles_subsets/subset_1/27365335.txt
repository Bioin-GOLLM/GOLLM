Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare, inherited, 
life-threatening, metabolic disorder of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor 
function characterized by elevated serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and rapidly 
progressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD). Since LDL receptors 
are predominantly found on hepatocytes, orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) 
has emerged as a viable intervention for HoFH because LDL receptor activity is 
restored. This study assessed the effects of OLT on ACVD and ACVD risk factors 
in pediatric patients with HoFH. We analyzed lipids, lipoproteins, body mass 
index, glucose, blood pressure, and cardiovascular imaging in 8 pediatric 
patients who underwent OLT for HoFH. Total serum cholesterol, LDL-C, lipoprotein 
(a), and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio decreased to normal values in 
all subjects (p values <0.001) at 1 month after OLT and were maintained for the 
length of follow-up (2 to 6 years). There were few complications related to 
surgery or immunosuppressive therapy. Two patients developed mild hypertension. 
In the first 4 subjects monitored for 4 to 6 years after OLT, coronary artery 
disease did not develop or progress except in 1 minor artery in 1 subject and 
actually regressed in 2 subjects with >50% stenosis. However, aortic valve 
stenosis progressed in 2 of 4 subjects. In conclusion, OLT is an effective 
therapeutic option for patients with HoFH with coronary artery disease and 
persistently elevated serum LDL-C despite maximum medical therapy. Aortic 
valvular disease may progress. Long-term data are needed to evaluate the true 
risk-benefit ratio of this surgical approach.
