MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate target 
mRNA expression, and altered expression of miRNAs is associated with liver 
pathological conditions. Recent studies in animal models have shown 
neutrophil/myeloid-specific microRNA-223 (miR-223) as a key regulator in the 
development of various liver diseases including fibrosis, where hepatic stellate 
cells (HSCs) are the key player in pathogenesis. However, the precise roles of 
miR-223 in human HSCs and its therapeutic potential to control fibrosis remain 
largely unexplored. Using primary human HSCs, we demonstrated that miR-223 
suppressed the fibrogenic program and cellular proliferation while promoting 
features of quiescent HSCs including lipid re-accumulation and retinol storage. 
Furthermore, induction of miR-223 in HSCs decreased cellular motility and 
contraction. Mechanistically, miR-223 negatively regulated expression of smooth 
muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and thus reduced cytoskeletal activity, which is known to 
promote amplification of fibrogenic signals. Restoration of α-SMA in 
miR-223-overexpressing HSCs alleviated the antifibrotic effects of miR-223. 
Finally, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-233 in liver fibrosis, we 
generated co-cultured organoids of HSCs with Huh7 hepatoma cells and challenged 
them with acetaminophen (APAP) or palmitic acid (PA) to induce hepatotoxicity. 
We showed that ectopic expression of miR-223 in HSCs attenuated fibrogenesis in 
the two human organoid models of liver injury, suggesting its potential 
application in antifibrotic therapy.
