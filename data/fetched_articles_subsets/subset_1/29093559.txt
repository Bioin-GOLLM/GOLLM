Hepcidin is a small cysteine rich peptide that regulates the sole known cellular 
iron exporter, ferroportin, effectively controlling iron metabolism. Contrary to 
humans, where a single hepcidin exists, many fish have two functionally distinct 
hepcidin types, despite having a single ferroportin gene. This raises the 
question of whether ferroportin is similarly regulated by the iron regulator 
Hamp1 and the antimicrobial Hamp2. In sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), iron 
overload prompted a downregulation of ferroportin, associated with an 
upregulation of hamp1, whereas an opposite response was observed during anemia, 
with no changes in hamp2 in either situation. During infection, ferroportin 
expression decreased, indicating iron withholding to avoid microbial 
proliferation. In vivo administration of Hamp1 but not Hamp2 synthetic peptides 
caused significant reduction in ferroportin expression, indicating that in 
teleost fish with two hepcidin types, ferroportin activity is mediated through 
the iron-regulator Hamp1, and not through the dedicated antimicrobial Hamp2. 
Additionally, in vitro treatment of mouse macrophages with fish Hamp1 but not 
Hamp2 caused a decrease in ferroportin levels. These results raise questions on 
the evolution of hepcidin and ferroportin functional partnership and open new 
possibilities for the pharmaceutical use of selected fish Hamp2 hepcidins during 
infections, with no impact on iron homeostasis.
