The authors sequenced POLG1, C10ORF2, and ANT1 in 38 sporadic progressive 
external ophthalmoplegia patients with multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
deletions. Causative mutations were identified in approximately 10% of cases, 
with two unrelated individuals harboring a novel premature stop codon mutation 
(1356T>G). None had a mutation in C10ORF2 or ANT1. In the majority of patients, 
the primary nuclear genetic defect is likely to affect other unknown genes 
important for mtDNA maintenance.
