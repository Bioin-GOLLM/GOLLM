During oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), Candida albicans invades and damages 
oral epithelial cells, which respond by producing proinflammatory mediators that 
recruit phagocytes to foci of infection. The ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) 
detects β-glucan and plays a central role in stimulating epithelial cells to 
release proinflammatory mediators during OPC. The epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) also interacts with C. albicans and is known to be activated by 
the Als3 adhesin/invasin and the candidalysin pore-forming toxin. Here, we 
investigated the interactions among EphA2, EGFR, Als3 and candidalysin during 
OPC. We found that EGFR and EphA2 constitutively associate with each other as 
part of a heteromeric physical complex and are mutually dependent for C. 
albicans-induced activation. Als3-mediated endocytosis of a C. albicans hypha 
leads to the formation of an endocytic vacuole where candidalysin accumulates at 
high concentration. Thus, Als3 potentiates targeting of candidalysin, and both 
Als3 and candidalysin are required for C. albicans to cause maximal damage to 
oral epithelial cells, sustain activation of EphA2 and EGFR, and stimulate 
pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion. In the mouse model of OPC, C. 
albicans-induced production of CXCL1/KC and CCL20 is dependent on the presence 
of candidalysin and EGFR, but independent of Als3. The production of IL-1α and 
IL-17A also requires candidalysin but is independent of Als3 and EGFR. The 
production of TNFα requires Als1, Als3, and candidalysin. Collectively, these 
results delineate the complex interplay among host cell receptors EphA2 and EGFR 
and C. albicans virulence factors Als1, Als3 and candidalysin during the 
induction of OPC and the resulting oral inflammatory response.
