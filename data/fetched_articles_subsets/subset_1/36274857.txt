Generalized pruritus can be the manifestation of many dermatologic and systemic 
diseases. However, it has been reported infrequently in the literature as a 
consequence of hyperferritinemia. We report the case of a 70-year-old male 
presenting to dermatology due to generalized pruritus in the absence of a rash, 
who was subsequently found to have a significantly elevated serum ferritin and 
transferrin saturation with otherwise normal iron studies. Hereditary 
hemochromatosis was ruled out on genetic testing; however, etiologies of 
secondary iron overload including alcohol use disorder and non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease were present. The patient had minimal relief of his pruritus with 
topical corticosteroids, oral prednisone, and moisturizers. The only successful 
treatment was phlebotomy which resulted in complete resolution of his 
long-standing pruritus. We present the fifth case of generalized pruritus 
associated with hyperferritinemia, treated successfully with phlebotomy.
