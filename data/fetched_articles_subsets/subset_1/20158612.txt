Small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are a widely conserved family of molecular 
chaperones, all containing a conserved alpha-crystallin domain flanked by 
variable N- and C-terminal tails. We report that IbpA and IbpB, the sHSPs of 
Escherichia coli, are substrates for the AAA+ Lon protease. This ATP-fueled 
enzyme degraded purified IbpA substantially more slowly than purified IbpB, and 
we demonstrate that this disparity is a consequence of differences in maximal 
Lon degradation rates and not in substrate affinity. Interestingly, however, 
IbpB stimulated Lon degradation of IbpA both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, 
although the variable N- and C-terminal tails of the Ibps were dispensable for 
proteolytic recognition, these tails contain critical determinants that control 
the maximal rate of Lon degradation. Finally, we show that E. coli Lon degrades 
variants of human alpha-crystallin, indicating that Lon recognizes conserved 
determinants in the folded alpha-crystallin domain itself. These results suggest 
a novel mode for Lon substrate recognition and provide a highly suggestive link 
between the degradation and sHSP branches of the protein quality-control 
network.
