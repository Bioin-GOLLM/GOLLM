The clinical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the COVID-19 vaccines' 
safety, efficacy and effectiveness in pediatric patients with asthma, are 
crucial to adapting clinical management in this fragile population and for 
prevention strategies. The aim of this narrative review was to evaluate the 
impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with asthma and the impact of 
COVID-19 vaccination. Systematic research using the principal medical databases 
was conducted using specific search query strings from the early spreading of 
COVID-19 globally until March 2023; further relevant data were drawn from the 
main national and supranational institutions. No significant differences in 
SARS-CoV-2 incidence and morbidity were found in asthmatic pediatric patients 
compared to non-asthmatic ones; however, subjects with uncontrolled asthma were 
found to be at increased risk of developing a serious disease during SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Regarding COVID-19 vaccines, accumulating data support their safety, 
efficacy and effectiveness on asthmatic children regardless of asthma severity. 
Further cohort-based studies are needed as the evidence of new epidemic waves 
caused by new viral variants makes the current knowledge outdated.
