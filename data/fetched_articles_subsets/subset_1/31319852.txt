BACKGROUND: The microbial production of useful fuels and chemicals has been 
widely studied. In several cases, glucose is used as the raw material, and 
almost all microbes adopt the Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway to degrade glucose 
into compounds of interest. Recently, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway has been 
gaining attention as an alternative strategy for microbial production.
RESULTS: In the present study, we attempted to apply the ED pathway for 
isobutanol production in Escherichia coli because of the complete redox balance 
involved. First, we generated ED pathway-dependent isobutanol-producing E. coli. 
Thereafter, the inactivation of the genes concerning organic acids as the 
byproducts was performed to improve the carbon flux to isobutanol from glucose. 
Finally, the expression of the genes concerning the ED pathway was modified.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimized isobutanol-producing E. coli produced 15.0 g/L of 
isobutanol as the final titer, and the yield from glucose was 0.37 g/g 
(g-glucose/g-isobutanol).
