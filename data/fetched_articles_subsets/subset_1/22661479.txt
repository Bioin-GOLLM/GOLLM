PURPOSE: Keratoconus is a bilateral noninflammatory progressive corneal disorder 
with complex genetic inheritance and a common cause for cornea transplantation 
in young adults. A genomewide linkage scan in keratoconus families identified a 
locus at 5q23.2, overlapping the gene coding for the lysyl oxidase (LOX). LOX 
encodes an enzyme responsible for collagen cross-linking in a variety of tissues 
including the cornea. Corneal collagen cross-linking with long-wave ultraviolet 
light and riboflavin is a promising new treatment for keratoconus. To determine 
whether LOX is a genetic determinant of the pathogenesis of keratoconus, we 
analyzed association results of LOX polymorphisms in two independent 
case-control samples and in keratoconus families.
METHODS: Association results were analyzed of single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the LOX gene from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) investigation 
in two independent panels of patients with keratoconus and controls and in 
keratoconus families.
RESULTS: Evidence of association was found at SNPs rs10519694 and rs2956540 
located in intron 4 of LOX in the GWAS discovery case-control panel with P 
values of 2.3×10(-3) and 7×10(-3), respectively. The same two SNPs were found to 
be associated with keratoconus by family-based association testing with P values 
of 2.7×10(-3) and 7.7×10(-4), respectively. Meta P values of 4.0×10(-5) and 
4.0×10(-7) were calculated for SNPs rs10519694 and rs2956540 by analyzing 
case-control and family samples simultaneously. Sequencing of LOX exons in a 
subset of keratoconus patients identified two polymorphisms, rs1800449 and 
rs2288393, located in LOX transcripts I and II, associated with keratoconus in 
case-control and family samples with a meta P value of 0.02.
CONCLUSIONS: Results provided strong genetic evidence that LOX variants lead to 
increased susceptibility to developing of keratoconus.
