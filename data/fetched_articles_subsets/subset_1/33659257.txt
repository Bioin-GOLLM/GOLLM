Sepsis represents one of the most pressing problems in pediatrics, characterized 
by pathogenic bacteria invading the blood, growing and multiplying in the blood 
circulation, and ultimately causing severe infections. Most children with sepsis 
have a rapid disease onset and frequently exhibit sudden high fever or first 
chills. Here we performed comprehensive metabolomic profiling of plasma samples 
collected from pediatric sepsis patients to identify specific metabolic 
alterations associated with these patients (n = 84, designated as case subjects) 
as compared to healthy cohorts (n = 59, designated as control subjects). 
Diagnostic models were constructed using MetaboAnalyst, R packages, and multiple 
statistical methods, such as orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant 
analysis, principal component analysis, volcano plotting, and one-way ANOVA. Our 
study revealed a panel of metabolites responsible for the discrimination between 
case and control subjects with a high predictive value of prognosis. Moreover, 
significantly altered metabolites in sepsis survivors versus deceased patients 
(non-survivors) were identified as those involved in amino acids, fatty acids, 
and carbohydrates metabolism. Nine metabolites including organic acids and fatty 
acids were also identified with significantly higher abundance in sepsis 
patients with related microbes, implicating greater potentials to distinguish 
bacterial species using metabolomic analysis than blood culture. Pathway 
enrichment analysis further revealed that fatty acid metabolism might play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis.
