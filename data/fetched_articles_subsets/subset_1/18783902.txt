Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a rare dysmyelinating disorder due to 
mutations in the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene. PLP gene mutations are 
responsible for a broad spectrum of disease, from the most severe form, connatal 
PMD, to a less severe form, spastic paraplegia 2 (SPG2). We describe here a very 
mild case of PMD in a patient who presented with nystagmus in early infancy and 
was unable to walk until 1 year 7 months of age. Brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at 1 year 7 months of age revealed white matter abnormalities 
typical of PMD. Genetic testing revealed a novel mutation of the PLP gene 
(Gly197Arg). The patient presented with only mildly ataxic gait and slurred 
speech at the age of 4 years. Gly197Arg is the first novel mutation located 
within exon 4 of the PLP gene and associated with mild PMD/SPG2 in a Japanese 
patient.
