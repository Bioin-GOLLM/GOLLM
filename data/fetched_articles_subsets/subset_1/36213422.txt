Osteonecrosis associated with the use of glucocorticoids is a severe, 
potentially debilitating complication. In broader terms, it commonly involves 
the femoral head with secondary hip osteoarthritis. Osteonecrosis can also be 
caused by trauma and other non-traumatic factors besides steroid treatment. 
Nonetheless, glucocorticoid use is frequently observed in clinical settings in 
which this represents a common therapeutic option, including general practice, 
rheumatology and clinical immunology, among others. The pathogenesis involves 
genetic components, vascular impairment, adipocyte hypertrophy, and increased 
intraosseous pressure, ultimately leading to marrow and bone ischemia and 
necrosis and the process rapidly becomes irreversible. Osteonecrosis manifests 
with pain and impaired motility while the diagnosis is usually made with 
magnetic resonance imaging allowing early detection and potentially (dependent 
on the patient's needs for steroids and stage) timely management with 
conservative options, followed by joint replacement at late stages. In this 
review we discuss the pathogenesis, risk factors, diagnosis, staging, and 
management of this complication associated with glucocorticoid treatment.
