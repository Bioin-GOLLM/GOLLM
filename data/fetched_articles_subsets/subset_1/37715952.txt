Sebaceous glands (SGs) release oils that protect our skin, but how these glands 
respond to injury has not been previously examined. Here, we report that SGs are 
largely self-renewed by dedicated stem cell pools during homeostasis. Using 
targeted single-cell RNA sequencing, we uncovered both direct and indirect paths 
by which resident SG progenitors ordinarily differentiate into sebocytes, 
including transit through a Krt5+PPARγ+ transitional basal cell state. Upon skin 
injury, however, SG progenitors depart their niche, reepithelialize the wound, 
and are replaced by hair-follicle-derived stem cells. Furthermore, following 
targeted genetic ablation of >99% of SGs from dorsal skin, these glands 
unexpectedly regenerate within weeks. This regenerative process is mediated by 
alternative stem cells originating from the hair follicle bulge, is dependent 
upon FGFR2 signaling, and can be accelerated by inducing hair growth. 
Altogether, our studies demonstrate that stem cell plasticity promotes SG 
durability following injury.
