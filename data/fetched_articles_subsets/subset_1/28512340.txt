Case-control genetic association studies typically ignore possible later disease 
onset in currently healthy subjects and assume that subjects with diseases 
equally contribute to the likelihood for inference, regardless of their onset 
age. Therefore, we used an event-history with risk-free model to simultaneously 
characterize alcoholism susceptibility and onset age in 65 independent 
non-Hispanic Caucasian males in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of 
Alcoholism. Following data quality control, we analysed 22 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) on 12 candidate genes. The single-SNP analysis showed that 
the dominant minor allele of rs2134655 on DRD3 increases alcoholism 
susceptibility; the dominant minor allele of rs1439047 on NTRK2 delays the 
alcoholism onset age, but the additive minor allele of rs172677 on GRIN2B and 
the dominant minor allele of rs63319 on ALDH1A1 advance the alcoholism onset 
age; and the dominant minor allele of rs1079597 on DRD2 shortens the onset age 
range. Similarly, multiple-SNPs analysis revealed joint effects of rs2134655, 
rs172677 and rs1079597, with an adjustment for habitual smoking. This study 
provides a more comprehensive understanding of the genetics of alcoholism than 
previous case-control studies.
