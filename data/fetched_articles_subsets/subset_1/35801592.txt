Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the 
skin with 2 etiologies. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) integration is present 
in about 80% of all MCC. Virus-positive MCC (MCCP) tumors have few somatic 
mutations and usually express WT p53 (TP53). By contrast, virus-negative MCC 
(MCCN) tumors present with a high tumor mutational burden and predominantly UV 
mutational signature. MCCN tumors typically contain mutated TP53. MCCP tumors 
express 2 viral proteins: MCPyV small T antigen and a truncated form of large T 
antigen. MCPyV ST specifically activates expression of MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase of p53, to inhibit p53-mediated tumor suppression. In this study, we 
assessed the efficacy of milademetan, a potent, selective, and orally available 
MDM2 inhibitor in several MCC models. Milademetan reduced cell viability of WT 
p53 MCC cell lines and triggered a rapid and sustained p53 response. Milademetan 
showed a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in MKL-1 xenograft and 
patient-derived xenograft models. Here, along with preclinical data for the 
efficacy of milademetan in WT p53 MCC tumors, we report several in vitro and in 
vivo models useful for future MCC studies.
