Glioblastoma is the most frequently occurring and invariably fatal primary brain 
tumor in adults. The vast majority of glioblastomas is characterized by 
chromosomal copy number alterations, including gain of whole chromosome 7 and 
loss of whole chromosome 10. Gain of whole chromosome 7 is an early event in 
gliomagenesis that occurs in proneural-like precursor cells, which give rise to 
all isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma transcriptional 
subtypes. Platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFA) is one gene on chromosome 7 
known to drive gliomagenesis, but, given its location near the end of 7p, there 
are likely several other genes located along chromosome 7 that select for its 
increased whole-chromosome copy number within glioblastoma cells. To identify 
other potential genes that could select for gain of whole chromosome 7, we 
developed an unbiased bioinformatics approach that identified homeobox A5 
(HOXA5) as a gene whose expression correlated with gain of chromosome 7 and a 
more aggressive phenotype of the resulting glioma. High expression of HOXA5 in 
glioblastoma was associated with a proneural gene expression pattern and 
decreased overall survival in both human proneural and PDGF-driven mouse 
glioblastoma. Furthermore, HOXA5 overexpression promoted cellular proliferation 
and potentiated radioresistance. We also found enrichment of HOXA5 expression in 
recurrent human and mouse glioblastoma at first recurrence after radiotherapy. 
Overall, this study implicates HOXA5 as a chromosome 7-associated gene-level 
locus that promotes selection for gain of whole chromosome 7 and an aggressive 
phenotype in glioblastoma.
