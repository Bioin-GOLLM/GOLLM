AIM: Our objective was to determine changes in bone mineral density (BMD), 
trabecular bone score (TBS), and body composition after 2 years of therapy with 
recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) in 2 prepubertal 
children with a complete lack of circulating PAPP-A2 due to a homozygous 
mutation in PAPP-A2 (p.D643fs25*) resulting in a premature stop codon.
METHODS: Body composition, BMD, and bone structure were determined by 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 1 and 2 years of rhIGF-1 
treatment.
RESULTS: Height increased from 132 to 145.5 cm (patient 1) and from 111.5 to 
124.5 cm (patient 2). Bone mineral content increased from 933.40 to 1,057.97 and 
1,152.77 g in patient 1, and from 696.12 to 773.26 and 911.51 g in patient 2, 
after 1 and 2 years, respectively. Whole-body BMD also increased after 2 years 
of rhIGF-1 from baseline 0.788 to 0.869 g/cm2 in patient 1 and from 0.763 to 
0.829 g/cm2 in patient 2. After 2 years of treatment, both children had an 
improvement in TBS. During therapy, a slight increase in body fat mass was seen, 
with a concomitant increase in lean mass. No adverse effects were reported.
CONCLUSION: Two years of rhIGF-1 improved growth, with a tendency to improve 
bone mass and bone microstructure and to modulate body composition.
