BACKGROUND: Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that 
occurs between inter- and intra-bacterial species and is regulated by signaling 
molecules called autoinducers (AIs). It has been suggested that probiotics can 
exert a QS inhibitory effect through their metabolites.
PURPOSE: To provide an overview of (1) the anti-QS activity of probiotics and 
its mechanism against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria; (2) the 
potential role of the QS of probiotics in gut health; and (3) the impact of 
microencapsulation on QS.
RESULTS: Lactobacillus species have been extensively studied for their anti-QS 
activity and have been found to effectively disrupt QS in vitro. However, their 
effectiveness in a food matrix is yet to be determined as they interfere with 
the AI receptor or its synthesis. QS plays an important role in both the biofilm 
formation of probiotics and pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and animal 
studies have shown that QS molecules can modulate cytokine responses and gut 
dysbiosis and maintain intestinal barrier function. In this scenario, 
microencapsulation was found to enhance AI activity. However, its impact on the 
anti-QS activity of probiotics and its underlying mechanism remains unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics are potential candidates to block QS activity in 
foodborne pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria. Microencapsulation increases QS 
efficacy. However, more research is still needed for the identification of the 
QS inhibitory metabolites from probiotics and for the elucidation of the anti-QS 
mechanism of probiotics (microcapsules and free cells) in food and the human 
gut.
