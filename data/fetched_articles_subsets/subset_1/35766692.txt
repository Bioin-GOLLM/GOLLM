OBJECTIVE: The polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder, 
characterized by the dysregulation of ovarian angiogenesis. This alteration can 
be related to changes in the activities of the vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) gene. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been observed in the 
promoter, intronic, and untranslated regions of the VEGF gene, and several 
studies have suggested that these polymorphisms may be associated with the risk 
of polycystic ovary syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the association 
between rs2010963 and rs833061 polymorphisms and haplotypes of VEGF in the 
etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome.
METHODS: A total of 210 women, 102 diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and 
108 controls, participated in this study. The genotyping of the samples was 
performed by PCR-RFLP and real-time PCR for rs2010963 and rs833061 
polymorphisms, respectively. The statistical analyses were performed by the 
chi-square test and logistic regression model.
RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of the patients showed that 75.8% of the 
patients did not become pregnant, 36.3% had a family history of polycystic ovary 
syndrome, 58.6% were obese, and about 60% had clinical characteristics of 
hyperandrogenism. There were no associations between the distribution of 
rs2010963 (OR 1.24; 95%CI 0.60-2.57; p=0.56) and rs833061 (OR 0.78; 95%CI 
0.32-1.92; p=0.59) in patients and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The patients with polycystic ovary syndrome have similar rates of 
VEGF polymorphisms rs2010963 and rs833061 on the general population.
