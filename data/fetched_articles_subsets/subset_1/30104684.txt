Chronic itch is a highly debilitating condition affecting about 10% of the 
general population. The relay of itch signals is under tight control by 
inhibitory circuits of the spinal dorsal horn, which may offer a hitherto 
unexploited therapeutic opportunity. Here, we found that specific 
pharmacological targeting of inhibitory α2 and α3GABAA receptors reduces acute 
histaminergic and non-histaminergic itch in mice. Systemic treatment with an 
α2/α3GABAA receptor selective modulator alleviates also chronic itch in a mouse 
model of atopic dermatitis and in dogs sensitized to house dust mites, without 
inducing sedation, motor dysfunction, or loss of antipruritic activity after 
prolonged treatment. Transsynaptic circuit tracing, immunofluorescence, and 
electrophysiological experiments identify spinal α2 and α3GABAA receptors as 
likely molecular targets underlying the antipruritic effect. Our results 
indicate that drugs targeting α2 and α3GABAA receptors are well-suited to 
alleviate itch, including non-histaminergic chronic itch for which currently no 
approved treatment exists.
