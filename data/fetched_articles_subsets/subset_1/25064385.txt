Guanylyl cyclase-C knock-out mice exhibit hyperactivity and attention deficits. 
We investigated seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Guanylate 
cyclase 2C gene (GUC2C) in 381 ADHD trios and 382 healthy controls. Transmission 
disequilibrium tests (TDT), case-control studies and quantitative analyses 
indicated association between GUC2C with ADHD and its core symptoms.
