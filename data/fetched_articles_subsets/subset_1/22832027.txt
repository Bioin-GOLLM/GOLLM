BACKGROUND/PURPOSE(S): Approximately 40% of patients with profound T-cell 
immunodeficiency have no identified molecular basis. Early assessment of T-cell 
impairment is vital for medical intervention, if hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation is needed. The dynamics of T-cell receptor excision circles 
(TRECs) revealing recent thymic output of naïve T cell and T-cell receptor (TCR) 
repertoire diversity reflecting broader responses to multiple antigens, are both 
important in resisting infections.
METHODS: The TRECs value and TCR repertoire diversity were evaluated from 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with primary severe T cell 
immunodeficiency, to elucidate the T-cell response.
RESULTS: In seven children with <30% of normal phytohemagglutinin 
(PHA)-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, including two IL2RG (Try74Gly and 
Arg226Lys, X-linked) and one RAG2 mutations [(Ser205Tyr) and (del 1366T, 
frameshift, 484stop); autosomal recessive], lower TRECs value and oligo- and 
restricted TCR diversity patterns, were associated with increased susceptibility 
to opportunistic infections, but not inversely correlated to the severity and 
frequency of infections. Three patients had successful cord blood stem cell 
transplantation which reconstructed the T cell immunodeficiency, with normalized 
TRECs value and TCR repertoire diversity at 6 months post-transplant, without 
clinical events.
CONCLUSION: Low TRECs value and restricted TCR repertoire diversity can help in 
the early diagnosis of T cell immunodeficiency before irreversible sequelae and 
in the monitoring of post-transplantation T-cell immune reconstruction.
