Food allergy is an emerging epidemic in the United States and the Western world. 
The determination of factors that make certain foods allergenic is still not 
clearly understood. Only a tiny fraction of thousands of proteins and other 
molecules is responsible for inducing food allergy. In this review, the authors 
present 3 examples of food allergies with disparate clinical presentations: 
peanut, soy, and mammalian meat. The potential relationships between allergen 
structure and function, emphasizing the importance of cross-reactive 
determinants, immunoglobulin E antibodies to the oligosaccharides, and the 
immune responses induced in humans are discussed.
