A second monoclinic polymorph of ethyl-enediammonium bis-(hydrogen squarate) 
monohydrate.

Zenkhri L, Bataille T, Audebrand N.

The title compound, C(2)H(10)N(2) (2+)·2HC(4)O(4) (-)·H(2)O, a new polymorph of 
ethyl-enediammonium bis-(hydrogen squarate) monohydrate, was synthesized by slow 
evaporation of an acid solution. The asymetric unit contains two hydrogen 
squarate anions, two half-mol-ecules of protonated ethyl-enediamine arranged 
around a twofold axis and one water mol-ecule. In the crystal, N-H⋯O and O-H⋯O 
hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen squarate anions, protonated N atoms from the 
amine group and water mol-ecules lead to a three-dimensional framework. In 
particular, the cohesion between the squarate groups is ensured by very short 
intermolecular hydrogen bonds bonds. The title compound crystallized together 
with the previously reported polymorph [Mathew et al. (2002 ▶). J. Mol. 
Struct.641, 263-279].
