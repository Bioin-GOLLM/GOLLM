BACKGROUND: Mutations in HBx gene are frequently found in HBV-associated 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
(HIF-1α) contributes to HCC development and progression. Wild-type HBx has been 
demonstrated to activate HIF-1α, but the effect of HBx mutations on HIF-1α has 
not been elucidated.
METHODS: HBx mutations were identified by gene sequencing in 101 HCC tissues. 
Representative HBx mutants were cloned and transfected into HCC cells. 
Expression and activation of HIF-1α were analysed by western blot and luciferase 
assays, respectively. The relationship between HBx mutants and HIF-1α expression 
in HCC tissues was also evaluated.
RESULTS: The dual mutations K130M/V131I enhanced the functionality of HBx as 
they upregulated the expression and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. The 
C-terminal truncations and deletion mutations, however, weakened the ability of 
HBx to upregulate HIF-1α. Meanwhile, the C-terminus was further found to be 
essential for the stability and transactivation of HBx. In the HCC tissues, 
there was a positive association between the HBx mutants and HIF-1α expression.
CONCLUSION: Different mutations of HBx exert differentiated effects on the 
functionality of HIF-1α, however, the overall activity of HBx mutants appears to 
increase the expression and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α.
