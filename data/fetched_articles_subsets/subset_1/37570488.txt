All-solid-state Tm lasers have a wider wavelength range and higher output power 
compared to other types of lasers. In this work, we demonstrate an 
all-solid-state, high repetition, Tm:YAP laser Q-switched by a graphdiyne (GDY) 
saturable absorber. The high-quality optical nonlinear material GDY, synthesized 
by a cross-coupling method, exhibits a strong nonlinear optical response. The 
application of GDY as a saturable absorber in the passively Q-switched (PQS) 
Tm:YAP of an all-solid-state laser has been realized with the shortest pulse 
duration of ~785 ns and repetition frequency of ~199.6 kHz at a central 
wavelength of 1985.8 nm. This represents the shortest pulse duration and the 
highest repetition frequency achieved from GDY in a solid-state Tm laser to 
date. Our work demonstrates the remarkable nonlinear optical properties of GDY, 
which holds promising potential in the field of optoelectronics.
