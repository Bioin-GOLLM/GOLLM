Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, humanity has experienced the spread 
and circulation of several SARS-CoV-2 variants that differed in 
transmissibility, contagiousness, and the ability to escape from vaccine-induced 
neutralizing antibodies. However, issues related to the differences in the 
variant-specific immune responses remain insufficiently studied. The aim of this 
study was to compare the parameters of the humoral immune responses in two 
groups of patients with acute COVID-19 who were infected during the circulation 
period of the D614G and the Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. Sera from 48 patients 
with acute COVID-19 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing 
antibodies using six assays. We found that serum samples from the D614G period 
demonstrated 3.9- and 1.6-fold increases in RBD- and spike-specific IgG binding 
with wild-type antigens compared with Delta variant antigens (p < 0.01). Cluster 
analysis showed the existence of two well-separated clusters. The first cluster 
mainly consisted of D614G-period patients and the second cluster predominantly 
included patients from the Delta period. The results thus obtained indicate that 
humoral immune responses in D614G- and Delta-specific infections can be 
characterized by variant-specific signatures. This can be taken into account 
when developing new variant-specific vaccines.
