The uterine luminal epithelium (LE) is the first maternal contact for an 
implanting embryo. Intrauterine fluid resorption, cessation of LE proliferation 
and apoptosis, and LE structural changes are prerequisites for establishing 
transient uterine receptivity for embryo implantation. Vesicle trafficking in 
the LE and receptor-mediated paracrine and autocrine mechanisms are crucial both 
for LE preparation and LE communications with the embryo and stroma during the 
initiation of embryo implantation. This review mainly covers recent in vivo 
studies in LE of mouse models from 0.5 days post-coitus (D0.5) to ∼D4 20 h when 
the trophoblasts pass through the LE layer for embryo implantation. The review 
is organized into three interconnected sections: preimplantation LE preparation 
for embryo attachment, embryo-LE communications, and LE-stroma communications.
