TP53 alterations are frequent relapse-acquired mutations in childhood acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present study evaluated the clinical 
significance of relapsed childhood ALL in Taiwan. Diagnostic and/or relapsed 
bone marrow or peripheral blood was obtained from 111 children with relapsed ALL 
who were initially treated by using Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG) ALL 
protocols from January 1997 to May 2018. Mutations were detected by PCR and 
sequencing, as well as by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to 
detect copy number alterations. Copy number and/or sequence alterations of TP53 
were detected in 29% (28 of 98) and in 46% (6 of 13) of patients with relapsed 
B-cell and T-cell ALL, respectively. This incidence was much higher than that in 
several similar studies conducted in Caucasian populations. Seventy percent of 
all TP53 alterations were gained at relapse in 67 matched samples by 
back-tracking matched diagnostic samples. TP53 alterations were associated with 
lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates (P = .013 
and P = .0002, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic 
significance of TP53 alterations. Forty-five patients received hematopoietic 
stem-cell transplantations post-relapse. Patients with TP53 alterations (14/45) 
had inferior 5-year EFS and OS than patients without TP53 alterations after 
transplantation (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively). The significance of these 
TP53 alterations for patients who received transplantations was confirmed by 
multivariate analysis. In conclusion, TP53 alterations were enriched and useful 
as prognostic markers in relapsed childhood ALL.
