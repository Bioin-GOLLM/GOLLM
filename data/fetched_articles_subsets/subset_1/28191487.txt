The contribution of microbiota in regulating multiple physiological and 
pathological host responses has been studied intensively in recent years. 
Evidence suggests that commensal microbiota can directly modulate different 
populations of cells of the immune system (e.g., Ivanov et al., 2008; Atarashi 
et al., 2011). Recently, we showed that protein extracts from gut commensal 
microbiota can activate retina-specific T cells, allowing these autoreactive T 
cells to then break through the blood-retinal barrier and trigger autoimmune 
uveitis in the recipient (Horai et al., 2015). The protocol below describes the 
method to prepare intestinal protein-rich extracts that can be used in various 
in vitro andin vivo immunological studies.
