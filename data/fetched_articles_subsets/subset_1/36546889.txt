BACKGROUND: Severe congenital neutropenia type 4 (SCN4) is a rare autosomal 
recessive granulopoiesis disorder caused by G6PC3 gene pathogenic variants. The 
estimated prevalence is 1/10,000,000 people. Over 90% of patients present a 
syndromic form with variable multisystemic involvement, including congenital 
heart defects, increased visibility of superficial veins (IVSV), inflammatory 
bowel disease, and congenital urogenital defects as prominent symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to study non-hematological phenotypic 
findings that suggest a clinical diagnosis of SCN4.
METHODS: We examined medical records of patients diagnosed with neutropenia from 
January 2000 to December 2020, selecting cases with non-hematologic 
manifestations for phenotypic description and G6PC3 gene sequencing.
RESULTS: We found 11 cases with non-hematologic features: congenital heart 
defects in 8, IVSV in 6, inflammatory bowel disease in 4, urogenital defects in 
4, and similar facial appearance. In addition, Sanger sequencing confirmed 3 
homozygous cases for the c.210delC variant, a compound heterozygous harboring 
this variant, and a c.199_218+1 deletion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of the c.210delC variant in very close geographical 
settings, to date, have only been reported among Mexicans, and a mutual uncommon 
surname in two families strongly supports a founder effect for the variant in 
the studied population. Furthermore, the described non-hematologic symptoms in 
patients with severe primary neutropenia should be explored, confirming SCN4 by 
investigating G6PC3 gene mutations.
