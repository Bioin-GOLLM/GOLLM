OBJECTIVES: Autoantibody formation to citrullinated (pro)filaggrin has proven to 
be a highly specific serological marker for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To test 
the potential relevance of mutations of the filaggrin (FLG) gene for disease 
susceptibility and elicitation of humoural autoimmunity in RA, a case-control 
association study of three loss-of-function FLG variants was performed.
METHODS: DNA was obtained from 282 patients with early RA (mean disease 
duration: 6.5 months) and from 376 control individuals. Three loss-of-function 
variants of the FLG gene (*R501X, *2282del4 and *3702del1) were genotyped.
RESULTS: No significant differences in genotype frequencies were observed 
between control probands and the population of RA patients. The FLG*3702del1 
allele was not identified in any of the patients nor controls, and none of the 
probands was homozygous or compound heterozygous. In the RA cohort, heterozygous 
carriers of either of the FLG variants exhibited a significantly elevated 
prevalence of autoantibodies to citrullinated peptides (CCP-2) (80%) compared to 
non-carriers (51.9%) (p = 0.018, odds ratio: 3.71 (1.20-11.46)).
CONCLUSIONS: The investigated FLG variants do not confer an overall risk for the 
development of RA. However, loss-of-function mutations in the FLG gene may 
contribute to the development of humoural autoimmunity, targeting citrullinated 
determinants in early RA.
