PURPOSE: A growing number of sequence changes of unknown clinical significance 
are being identified in the BRCA1 gene. However, these variants cannot be used 
for identification and surveillance of at-risk individuals unless their 
pathogenic role can be demonstrated. The frequency of these variants makes 
research on this subject a relevant topic in the field of predisposition to 
breast and ovarian cancers. Herein, we investigate the pathogenicity of the 
BRCA1 p.Val1688del (c.5181_5183delGTT) variant, which recurs in our population.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Recent studies have drawn attention to different 
strategies that, if considered singly, do not usually provide sufficient power 
to firmly state for or against causality, thus forcing to a re-evaluation of the 
literature on each specific variant. To increase the power of our study, we used 
a recently described strategy that integrates data from multiple independent 
evidences. By this approach, we analyzed data from the comprehensive study of 12 
breast/ovarian cancer families carrying p.Val1688del.
RESULTS: We succeeded in integrating five independent evidences of disease 
causality including segregation, tumor pathology, and evolutionary and 
epidemiologic data. Under this model, we obtained a final score of 349,000:1 in 
favor of disease causality. This result largely matches established cutoffs, and 
thus is readily translatable into a clear clinical message.
CONCLUSION: We show that p.Val1688del is a pathogenic mutation deriving from a 
common founder. Notably, this study alone increases by 15% the number of 
BRCA1-positive families in our patients' cohort, thus substantially contributing 
to explain many of the families wherein prediction of a BRCA1 mutation 
contrasted with the absence of a molecular recognizable defect.
