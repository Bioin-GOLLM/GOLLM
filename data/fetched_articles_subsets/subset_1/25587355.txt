BACKGROUND: The repair of spontaneous and induced DNA lesions is a multistep 
process. Depending on the type of injury, damaged DNA is recognized by many 
proteins specifically involved in distinct DNA repair pathways.
RESULTS: We analyzed the DNA-damage response after ultraviolet A (UVA) and γ 
irradiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and focused on upstream binding 
factor 1 (UBF1), a key protein in the regulation of ribosomal gene 
transcription. We found that UBF1, but not nucleolar proteins RPA194, TCOF, or 
fibrillarin, was recruited to UVA-irradiated chromatin concurrently with an 
increase in heterochromatin protein 1β (HP1β) level. Moreover, Förster Resonance 
Energy Transfer (FRET) confirmed interaction between UBF1 and HP1β that was 
dependent on a functional chromo shadow domain of HP1β. Thus, overexpression of 
HP1β with a deleted chromo shadow domain had a dominant-negative effect on UBF1 
recruitment to UVA-damaged chromatin. Transcription factor UBF1 also interacted 
directly with DNA inside the nucleolus but no interaction of UBF1 and DNA was 
confirmed outside the nucleolus, where UBF1 recruitment to DNA lesions appeared 
simultaneously with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers; this occurrence was 
cell-cycle-independent.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the simultaneous presence and interaction of UBF1 
and HP1β at DNA lesions is activated by the presence of cyclobutane pyrimidine 
dimers and mediated by the chromo shadow domain of HP1β. This might have 
functional significance for nucleotide excision repair.
