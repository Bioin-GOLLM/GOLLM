BACKGROUND: Agalsidase β is a form of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry 
disease, a genetic disorder characterised by low α-galactosidase A activity, 
accumulation of glycosphingolipids and life-threatening cardiovascular, renal 
and cerebrovascular events. In clinical trials, agalsidase β cleared glycolipid 
deposits from endothelial cells within 6 months; clearance from other cell types 
required sustained treatment. We hypothesised that there might be a 'lag time' 
to clinical benefit after initiating agalsidase β treatment, and analysed the 
incidence of severe clinical events over time in patients receiving agalsidase 
β.
METHODS: The incidence of severe clinical events (renal failure, cardiac events, 
stroke, death) was studied in 1044 adult patients (641 men, 403 women) enrolled 
in the Fabry Registry who received agalsidase β (average dose 1 mg/kg every 
2 weeks) for up to 5 years.
RESULTS: The incidence of all severe clinical events was 111 per 1000 
person-years (95% CI 84 to 145) during the first 6 months. After 6 months, the 
incidence decreased and remained stable within the range of 40-58 events per 
1000 patient-years. The largest decrease in incidence rates was among male 
patients and those aged ≥40 years when agalsidase β was initiated.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the expected increased incidence of severe clinical 
events with time, adult patients with Fabry disease had decreased incidence of 
severe clinical events after 6 months treatment with agalsidase β 1 mg/kg every 
2 weeks.
