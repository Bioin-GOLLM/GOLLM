Global primary production is driven largely by oxygenic photosynthesis, with 
algae as major contributors. The green alga Chromochloris zofingiensis 
reversibly switches off photosynthesis in the presence of glucose in the light 
and augments production of biofuel precursors (triacylglycerols) and the 
high-value antioxidant astaxanthin. Here we used forward genetics to reveal that 
this photosynthetic and metabolic switch is mediated by the glycolytic enzyme 
hexokinase (CzHXK1). In contrast to wild-type, glucose-treated hxk1 mutants do 
not shut off photosynthesis or accumulate astaxanthin, triacylglycerols, or 
cytoplasmic lipid droplets. We show that CzHXK1 is critical for the regulation 
of genes related to photosynthesis, ketocarotenoid synthesis and fatty acid 
biosynthesis. Sugars play fundamental regulatory roles in gene expression, 
physiology, metabolism, and growth in plants and animals, and we introduce a 
relatively simple, emerging model system to investigate conserved eukaryotic 
sugar sensing and signaling at the base of the green lineage.
