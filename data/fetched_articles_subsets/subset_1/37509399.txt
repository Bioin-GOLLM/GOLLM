Microwave thermal ablation is a promising emerging treatment for early-stage 
lung cancer. Applicator design optimisation and treatment planning rely on 
accurate knowledge of dielectric tissue properties. Limited dielectric data are 
available in the literature for human lung tissue and pulmonary tumours. In this 
work, neoplastic and non-neoplastic lung dielectric properties are characterised 
and correlated with gross and histological morphology. Fifty-six surgical 
specimens were obtained from twelve patients undergoing lung resection for lung 
cancer in University Hospital of Galway, Ireland. Dielectric spectroscopy in the 
microwave frequency range (500 MHz-8.5 GHz) was performed on the ex vivo lung 
specimens with the open-ended coaxial probe technique (in the Department of 
Pathology). Dielectric data were analysed and correlated with the tissue 
histology. The dielectric properties of twelve lung tumours (67% non-small cell 
carcinoma (NSCC)) and uninvolved lung parenchyma were obtained. The values 
obtained from the neoplastic lung specimens (relative permittivity: 52.0 ± 5.4, 
effective conductivity: 1.9 ± 0.2 S/m, at 2.45 GHz) were on average twice the 
value of the non-neoplastic lung specimens (relative permittivity: 28.3 ± 6.7, 
effective conductivity: 1.0 ± 0.3 S/m, at 2.45 GHz). Dense fibrosis was 
comparable with tumour tissue (relative permittivity 49.3 ± 4.6, effective 
conductivity: 1.8 ± 0.1 S/m, at 2.45 GHz).
