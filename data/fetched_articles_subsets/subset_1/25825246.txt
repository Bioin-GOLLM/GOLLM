A Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, pale-pink-pigmented bacterium, 
designated strain G27(T), was isolated from a volcanic forest of Jeju Island, 
South Korea. Cells were catalase- and oxidase-positive, non-motile rods 
producing exopolysaccharide and flexirubin-type and pale pink pigments. Growth 
of strain G27(T) was observed at 4-30 °C (optimum, 25 °C) and pH 5.0-8.0 
(optimum, pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed 
that strain G27(T) formed a phyletic lineage within the genus Mucilaginibacter 
of the family Sphingobacteriaceae. Strain G27(T) was related most closely to 
Mucilaginibacter gossypii Gh-67(T) at 96.5% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. 
Strain G27(T) contained menaquinone 7 (MK-7) as the sole isoprenoid quinone and 
summed feature 3 (comprising C16:1ω7c/C16:1ω6c), iso-C15:0, C16:0, C16:1ω5c and 
C16:1ω5c as the major cellular fatty acids. Phosphatidylethanolamine was 
identified as the major polar lipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 46.5 
mol%. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular properties, 
strain G27(T) represents a novel species of the genus Mucilaginibacter, for 
which the name Mucilaginibacter vulcanisilvae sp. nov. is proposed. The type 
strain is G27(T) ( = KACC 18231(T) = JCM 30363(T)).
