Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major pathogen of acute lower 
respiratory tract infection among young children. To investigate the prevalence 
and genetic characteristics of RSV in China, we performed a molecular 
epidemiological study during 2015-2019. A total of 964 RSV-positive specimens 
were identified from 5529 enrolled patients during a multi-center study. RSV 
subgroup A (RSV-A) was the predominant subgroup during this research period 
except in 2016. Totally, 535 sequences of the second hypervariable region 
(HVR-2) of the G gene were obtained. Combined with 182 Chinese sequences from 
GenBank, phylogenetic trees showed that 521 RSV-A sequences fell in genotypes 
ON1 (512), NA1 (6) and GA5 (3), respectively; while 196 RSV-B sequences fell in 
BA9 (193) and SAB4 (3). ON1 and BA9 were the only genotypes after December 2015. 
Genotypes ON1 and BA9 can be separated into 10 and 7 lineages, respectively. The 
HVR-2 of genotype ON1 had six amino acid changes with a frequency more than 10%, 
while two substitutions H258Q and H266L were co-occurrences. The HVR-2 of 
genotype BA9 had nine amino acid substitutions with a frequency more than 10%, 
while the sequences with T290I and T312I were all from 2018 to 2019. One 
N-glycosylation site at 237 was identified among ON1 sequences, while two 
N-glycosylation sites (296 and 310) were identified in the 60-nucleotide 
duplication region of BA9. To conclusion, ON1 and BA9 were the predominant 
genotypes in China during 2015-2019. For the genotypes ON1 and BA9, the G gene 
exhibited relatively high diversity and evolved continuously.
