PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNAs), once thought to be mainly functioning in 
germlines, are now known to play an essential role in somatic and cancerous 
tissues. Ping-pong cycle initiation and mitochondria-based phased production 
constitute the core of the piRNA biogenesis and these two processes are well 
conserved in mammals, including humans. By being involved in DNA methylation, 
histone marker deposition, mRNA degradation, and protein modification, piRNAs 
also contribute to carcinogenesis partly due to oncogenic stress-induced piRNA 
dysregulation. Also, piRNAs play important roles in cancer stemness, drug 
resistance, and tumor immunology. Results from liquid biopsy analysis of piRNA 
can be used in both cancer diagnoses and cancer prognoses. A combination of 
targeting piRNA with other therapeutic strategies could be groundbreaking cancer 
treatment.
