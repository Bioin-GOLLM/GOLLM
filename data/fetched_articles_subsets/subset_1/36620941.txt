Microglial activation occurs early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and previous 
studies reported both detrimental and protective effects of microglia on AD 
progression. Here, we used CSF sTREM2 to investigate disease stage-dependent 
drivers of microglial activation and to determine downstream consequences on AD 
progression. We included 402 patients with measures of earliest beta-amyloid 
(CSF Aβ1-42 ) and late-stage fibrillary Aβ pathology (amyloid-PET centiloid), as 
well as sTREM2, p-tau181 , and FDG-PET. To determine disease stage, we 
stratified participants into early Aβ-accumulators (Aβ CSF+/PET-; n = 70) or 
late Aβ-accumulators (Aβ CSF+/PET+; n = 201) plus 131 controls. In early 
Aβ-accumulators, higher centiloid was associated with 
cross-sectional/longitudinal sTREM2 and p-tau181 increases. Further, higher 
sTREM2 mediated the association between centiloid and 
cross-sectional/longitudinal p-tau181 increases and higher sTREM2 was associated 
with FDG-PET hypermetabolism. In late Aβ-accumulators, we found no association 
between centiloid and sTREM2 but a cross-sectional association between higher 
sTREM2, higher p-tau181 and glucose hypometabolism. Our findings suggest that a 
TREM2-related microglial response follows earliest Aβ fibrillization, manifests 
in inflammatory glucose hypermetabolism and may facilitate subsequent p-tau181 
increases in earliest AD.
