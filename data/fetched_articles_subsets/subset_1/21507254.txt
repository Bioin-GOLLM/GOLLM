BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the frequencies of risk alleles of SNPs 
mediating susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases differ among populations of 
varying geographic origin and that population-specific selection has operated on 
some of these variants.
METHODS: From the database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we 
selected 36 cardiovascular phenotypes including coronary heart disease, 
hypertension, and stroke, as well as related quantitative traits (eg, body mass 
index and plasma lipid levels). We identified 292 SNPs in 270 genes associated 
with a disease or trait at P < 5 × 10⁻⁸. As part of the Human Genome-Diversity 
Project (HGDP), 158 (54.1%) of these SNPs have been genotyped in 938 individuals 
belonging to 52 populations from seven geographic areas. A measure of population 
differentiation, F(ST), was calculated to quantify differences in risk allele 
frequencies (RAFs) among populations and geographic areas.
RESULTS: Large differences in RAFs were noted in populations of Africa, East 
Asia, America and Oceania, when compared with other geographic regions. The mean 
global F(ST) (0.1042) for 158 SNPs among the populations was not significantly 
higher than the mean global F(ST) of 158 autosomal SNPs randomly sampled from 
the HGDP database. Significantly higher global F(ST) (P < 0.05) was noted in 
eight SNPs, based on an empirical distribution of global F(ST) of 2036 
putatively neutral SNPs. For four of these SNPs, additional evidence of 
selection was noted based on the integrated Haplotype Score.
CONCLUSION: Large differences in RAFs for a set of common SNPs that influence 
risk of cardiovascular disease were noted between the major world populations. 
Pairwise comparisons revealed RAF differences for at least eight SNPs that might 
be due to population-specific selection or demographic factors. These findings 
are relevant to a better understanding of geographic variation in the prevalence 
of cardiovascular disease.
