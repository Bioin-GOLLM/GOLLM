GD3 synthase is rapidly activated in different cell types after specific 
apoptotic stimuli. De novo synthesized GD3 accumulates and contributes to the 
apoptotic program by relocating to mitochondrial membranes and inducing the 
release of apoptogenic factors. We found that sialic acid acetylation suppresses 
the proapoptotic activity of GD3. In fact, unlike GD3, 9-O-acetyl-GD3 is 
completely ineffective in inducing cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation 
on isolated mitochondria and fails to induce the collapse of mitochondrial 
transmembrane potential and cellular apoptosis. Moreover, cells which are 
resistant to the overexpression of the GD3 synthase, actively convert de novo 
synthesized GD3 to 9-O-acetyl-GD3. The coexpression of GD3 synthase with a viral 
9-O-acetyl esterase, which prevents 9-O-acetyl-GD3 accumulation, reconstitutes 
GD3 responsiveness and apoptosis. Finally, the expression of the 9-O-acetyl 
esterase is sufficient to induce apoptosis of glioblastomas which express high 
levels of 9-O-acetyl-GD3. Thus, sialic acid acetylation critically controls the 
proapoptotic activity of GD3.
