Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multifactorial disease with limited 
therapeutic options. Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors are involved in 
ALS motor neuron degeneration. One possible effector accelerating motor neuron 
death in ALS is damage to the blood-Central Nervous System barrier (B-CNS-B), 
mainly due to endothelial cell (EC) degeneration. Although mechanisms of EC 
damage in ALS are still unknown, vascular impairment may be initiated by various 
humoral inflammatory factors and other mediators. Systemic IL-6-mediated 
inflammation is a possible early extrinsic effector leading to the EC death 
causing central nervous system (CNS) barrier damage. In this review, we discuss 
the potential role of humoral factors in triggering EC alterations in ALS. A 
specific focus was on humoral IL-6 cytokine mediating EC inflammation via the 
trans-signaling pathway. Our preliminary in vitro studies demonstrated a proof 
of principle that short term exposure of human bone marrow endothelial cells to 
plasma from ALS patient leads to cell morphological changes, significantly 
upregulated IL-6R immunoexpression, and pro-inflammatory cell response. Our 
in-depth understanding of specific molecular mechanisms of this humoral cytokine 
in EC degeneration may facilitate an endothelial-IL-6-targeting therapy for 
restoring cell homeostasis and eventually reestablishing B-CNS-B integrity in 
ALS.
