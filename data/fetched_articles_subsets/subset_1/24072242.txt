We present 2 cases of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in 2 gypsy 
adolescents from related families. The patients had low antithrombin activity 
levels and inherited homozygous antithrombin deficiency was confirmed by 
molecular analysis (Leu131Phe mutation). One patient had a history of 
nephrectomy at the age of 9 due to nonfunctioning kidney and 2 siblings died at 
4 months of age. His mother had 3 fetal losses in the third trimester. The other 
propositus had an elder sister who suffered from postpartum deep vein thrombosis 
and pulmonary embolism. Heterozygous mutation was demonstrated in both parents.
