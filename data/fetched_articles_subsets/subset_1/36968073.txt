Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain containing 5 (NLRC5) is the key 
transcriptional regulator of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I genes. 
Recent observations suggest a role for NLRC5 in metabolic traits and in 
transcriptional regulation beyond MHC class I genes. To understand the function 
of NLRC5 in metabolic disease, we subjected Nlrc5 -/- mice to high-fat diet 
(HFD) feeding. Female Nlrc5 -/- mice presented with higher weight gain and more 
adipose tissue (AT) compared to wild-type (WT) animals. Mechanistically, we 
demonstrate that NLRC5 enhanced the expression of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ target genes in human cells. We 
identify Sin3A and negative elongation factor (NELF) B as two novel NLRC5 
interaction partners and show that Sin3A partly modulates the synergistic 
transcriptional effect of NLRC5 on PPARγ. Collectively, we show that NLRC5 
contributes to weight gain in mice, which involves transcriptional enhancement 
of PPARγ targets by NLRC5 that is co-regulated by Sin3A.
