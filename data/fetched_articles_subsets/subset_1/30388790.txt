Influenza H7N9 virus is a potentially pandemic subtype to which most people are 
immunologically naïve. To be better prepared for the potential occurrence of an 
H7N9 pandemic, in 2017 the World Health Organization recommended developing 
candidate vaccine viruses from two new H7N9 viruses, A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 
(A/GD) and A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (A/HK). This report describes the development of 
live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) candidates against A/GD and A/HK 
viruses and study of their safety and immunogenicity in the ferret model in 
order to choose the most promising one for a phase I clinical trial. The 
A/HK-based vaccine candidate (A/17/HK) was developed by classical reassortment 
in eggs. The A/GD-based vaccine candidate (A/17/GD) was generated by reverse 
genetics. Ferrets were vaccinated with two doses of LAIV or phosphate-buffered 
saline. Both H7N9 LAIVs tested were safe for ferrets, as shown by absence of 
clinical signs, and by virological and histological data; they were immunogenic 
after a single vaccination. These results provide a compelling argument for 
further testing of these vaccines in volunteers. Since the A/HK virus represents 
the cluster that has caused the majority of human cases, and because the 
A/HK-based LAIV candidate was developed by classical reassortment, this is the 
preferred candidate for a phase I clinical trial.
