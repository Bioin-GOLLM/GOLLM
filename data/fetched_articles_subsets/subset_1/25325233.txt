BACKGROUND: Numerous genetic risk factors of ischemic stroke (IS) have been 
reported from both candidate gene and genome-wide strategies with inconsistent 
results. The objective of this study was to confirm the relationship between 10 
previously identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and IS in the 
Chinese population.
METHODS: A family-based study was conducted in a rural area of Beijing, with a 
total of 227 IS families with 622 participants recruited. Both linkage and 
association analyses were performed, with all the sibling pairs derived from the 
227 families analyzed using the sib-pair test of model-free linkage to assess 
linkage between SNPs and IS, with association analyses including a family-based 
association test (FBAT) and generalized estimating equations (GEE).
RESULTS: Nonparametric linkage analysis revealed that the rs1800796 polymorphism 
in the interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene is significantly linked to the small arterial 
occlusion (SAO) subtype (p=0.022), while the rs7193343 polymorphism in the ZFHX3 
gene is linked to IS (p=0.002) under the dominant model. Significant allelic 
associations were identified between the G allele of rs1800796 and IS (p=0.042) 
and the SAO subtype (p=0.025) in the FBAT. The GEE method revealed that the G 
allele of rs1800796 increased IS risk by 1.55-fold (95% 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.01, 2.37; p=0.043) and 2.43-fold (95% CI: 1.32, 4.45; p=0.004) in the 
SAO subtype in the dominant model, which correlated with the significant 
associations detected in the FBAT.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we confirmed that the SNP of rs1800796 in the IL-6 
gene is related to IS and the SAO subtype using different statistical 
approaches. These findings could contribute to identifying individuals with a 
high IS risk.
