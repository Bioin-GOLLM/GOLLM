The aim of our work was the synthesis and physicochemical characterization of a 
unique conjugate consisting of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and a 
pharmacologically active anticancer substance abiraterone (AB). The direct 
coupling of AB with gold constitutes an essential feature of the unique AuNPs⁻AB 
conjugate that creates a promising platform for applications in nanomedicine. In 
this work, we present a multidisciplinary, basic study of the obtained AuNPs⁻AB 
conjugate. Theoretical modeling based on the density functional theory (DFT) 
predicted that the Aun clusters would interact with abiraterone preferably at 
the N-side. A sharp, intense band at 1028 cm-1 was observed in the Raman spectra 
of the nanoparticles. The shift of this band in comparison to AB itself agrees 
well with the theoretical model. AB in the nanoparticles was identified by means 
of electrochemistry and NMR spectroscopy. The sizes of the Au crystallites 
measured by XRPD were about 9 and 17 nm for the nanoparticles obtained in pH 7.4 
and 3.6, respectively. The size of the particles as measured by TEM was 24 and 
30 nm for the nanoparticles obtained in pH 7.4 and pH 3.6, respectively. The DLS 
measurements revealed stable, negatively charged nanoparticles.
