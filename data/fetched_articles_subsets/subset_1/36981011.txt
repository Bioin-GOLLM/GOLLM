Stress is a primary risk factor for psychiatric disorders such as Major 
Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The 
response to stress involves the regulation of transcriptional programs, which is 
supposed to play a role in coping with stress. To evaluate transcriptional 
processes implemented after exposure to unavoidable traumatic stress, we applied 
microarray expression analysis to the PFC of rats exposed to acute footshock 
(FS) stress that were sacrificed immediately after the 40 min session or 2 h or 
24 h after. While no substantial changes were observed at the single gene level 
immediately after the stress session, gene set enrichment analysis showed 
alterations in neuronal pathways associated with glia development, glia-neuron 
networking, and synaptic function. Furthermore, we found alterations in the 
expression of gene sets regulated by specific transcription factors that could 
represent master regulators of the acute stress response. Of note, these 
pathways and transcriptional programs are activated during the early stress 
response (immediately after FS) and are already turned off after 2 h-while at 24 
h, the transcriptional profile is largely unaffected. Overall, our analysis 
provided a transcriptional landscape of the early changes triggered by acute 
unavoidable FS stress in the PFC of rats, suggesting that the transcriptional 
wave is fast and mild, but probably enough to activate a cellular response to 
acute stress.
