Andrographolide (Andro), the major constituent of Andrographis paniculata Nees 
(Acanthaceae), is was known to reduces inflammatory reaction. In the current 
study, the ability of Andro to reduce pain sensation in a rat post-operative 
wound model was explored. The hind paws of 18 Sprague-Dawley rats (SD) bearing 
post-operative wounds received the following three treatments: Saline, Andro via 
direct injection into the paw (Andro-injected) and Tablet containing Andro + 
poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (Andro-tablet). Von Frey tests assessed 
mechanical allodynia at 1, 3, 5 h and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-days post-operation. 
Behavioral analyses were performed to measure reaction threshold and reaction 
frequencies. Immunoreactivity of p-ERK and GluR1 was examined in the dorsal horn 
of the spinal cord. Histopathological and immunostaining studies were conducted 
on paw epidermis to observe the gross morphology and angiogenesis. The threshold 
for inducing allodynia increased and the reaction frequency reduced in the 
Andro-injected group compared to the saline-group, at 3 h post-surgery and the 
effect lasted between 3-4 days. The threshold for inducing pain and reaction 
frequency for the Andro-tablet group did not differ from the saline-treated 
group. The levels of p-ERK and GluR1 in the dorsal horn were reduced after Andro 
treatment. No significant difference in wound healing index was observed between 
saline and Andro-injected groups, but CD-31 staining showed less angiogenesis in 
the Andro-injected group. Andro significantly reduced mechanical allodynia 
compared to saline treatment, both in shorter and longer time frames. 
Furthermore, Andro influenced the expression of p-ERK and GluR1 in the dorsal 
horn, and the angiogenesis process in the wound healing area.
