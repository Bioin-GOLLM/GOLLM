Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1, also termed Ad4BP; NR5A1 in the official 
nomenclature) is a nuclear receptor transcription factor that plays a crucial 
role in the regulation of adrenal and gonadal development, function and 
maintenance. In addition to its classical role in regulating the expression of 
P450 steroid hydroxylases and other steroidogenic genes, involvement in other 
key processes such as cell survival/proliferation and cytoskeleton dynamics have 
also been highlighted for SF-1. SF-1 has a restricted pattern of expression, 
being expressed along the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and in steroidogenic 
organs since the time of their establishment. Reduced SF-1 expression affects 
proper gonadal and adrenal organogenesis and function. On the other hand, SF-1 
overexpression is found in adrenocortical carcinoma and represents a prognostic 
marker for patients' survival. This review is focused on the current knowledge 
about SF-1 and the crucial importance of its dosage for adrenal gland 
development and function, from its involvement in adrenal cortex formation to 
tumorigenesis. Overall, data converge towards SF-1 being a key player in the 
complex network of transcriptional regulation within the adrenal gland in a 
dosage-dependent manner.
