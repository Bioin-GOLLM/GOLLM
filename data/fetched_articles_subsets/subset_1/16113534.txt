OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence in the Michigan non-Hispanic Caucasian 
population of the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene associated with 
hereditary hemochromatosis.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism 
analysis were performed on 3,532 blood samples from newborn screening cards 
provided by the state of Michigan.
RESULTS: More than 30% of Michigan Caucasians carry one HFE mutation, while 6% 
have two mutations. The allele frequency of the C282Y mutation is 5.7%, 
significantly higher than expected (p < 0.05), while the frequency of the H63D 
mutation is 14%, significantly lower than expected (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first publication to examine HFE allele frequencies in 
an unbiased sample of the Caucasian population. Results indicate that the C282Y 
mutation may be more common in the non-Hispanic Caucasian population than 
previously reported, and medical problems related to iron overload may be a 
health concern for Michigan non-Hispanic Caucasians. Additional studies of 
penetrance for the C282Y allele are required to fully understand the impact of 
this information.
