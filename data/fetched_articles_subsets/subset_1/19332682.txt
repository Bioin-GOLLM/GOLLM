Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 189) from patients with invasive 
infections were analyzed for capsular type by PCR, for antimicrobial 
susceptibility, and for the presence of resistance genes. In contrast to the 
predominance of capsular type III in children, types Ib and V were most common 
among adults. All 45 levofloxacin-resistant strains had two amino acid 
substitutions, Ser(81)Leu in the gyrA gene and Ser(79)Phe in the parC gene, and 
showed similar pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns.
