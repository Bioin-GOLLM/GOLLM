Following a Mediterranean diet high in plant-based foods and fish, low in meat 
and dairy foods, and with moderate alcohol intake has been shown to promote 
healthy aging. Therefore, we examined the association between a Mediterranean 
diet and trajectories of cognitive performance in the InCHIANTI study. Subjects 
(N = 832) were examined every 2⁻3 years up to 18 years with an average follow-up 
period of 10.1 years. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Mini Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) at every visit. Dietary habits were assessed using a 
validated food frequency questionnaire and adherence to Mediterranean diet was 
computed on a scale of 0-9 and categorized into three groups of low (≤3), medium 
(4⁻5), and high (≥6). Those in the highest adherence group (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 
0.29⁻0.79) and medium adherence group (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41⁻0.99) were less 
likely to experience cognitive decline. The annual average decline in MMSE 
scores was 0.4 units, for those in the high and medium adherence group this 
decline was attenuated by 0.34 units (p < 0.001) and 0.16 units (p = 0.03), 
respectively. Our findings suggest that adherence to a Mediterranean diet can 
have long-lasting protective effects on cognitive decline and may be an 
effective strategy for the prevent or delay dementia.
