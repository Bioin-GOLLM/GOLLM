AIM: Helicobacter pylori cytotoxin-associated protein A (CagA) is an important 
virulence factor known to induce gastric cancer development. However, the cause 
and the underlying molecular events of CagA induction remain unclear. Here, we 
applied integrated bioinformatics to identify the key genes involved in the 
process of CagA-induced gastric epithelial cell inflammation and can ceration to 
comprehend the potential molecular mechanisms involved.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: AGS cells were transected with pcDNA3.1 and 
pcDNA3.1::CagA for 24 h. The transfected cells were subjected to transcriptome 
sequencing to obtain the expressed genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) 
with adjusted P value < 0.05, - logFC -> 2 were screened, and the R package was 
applied for gene ontology (GO) enrichment and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. The differential gene protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING Cytoscape 
application, which conducted visual analysis to create the key function networks 
and identify the key genes. Next, the Kaplan-Meier plotter survival analysis 
tool was employed to analyze the survival of the key genes derived from the PPI 
network. Further analysis of the key gene expressions in gastric cancer and 
normal tissues were performed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database 
and RT-qPCR verification.
RESULTS: After transfection of AGS cells, the cell morphology changes in a 
hummingbird shape and causes the level of CagA phosphorylation to increase. 
Transcriptomics identified 6882 DEG, of which 4052 were upregulated and 2830 
were downregulated, among which q-value < 0.05, FC > 2, and FC under the 
condition of ≤2. Accordingly, 1062 DEG were screened, of which 594 were 
upregulated and 468 were downregulated. The DEG participated in a total of 151 
biological processes, 56 cell components, and 40 molecular functions. The KEGG 
pathway analysis revealed that the DEG were involved in 21 pathways. The PPI 
network analysis revealed three highly interconnected clusters. In addition, 30 
DEG with the highest degree were analyzed in the TCGA database. As a result, 12 
DEG were found to be highly expressed in gastric cancer, while seven DEG were 
related to the poor prognosis of gastric cancer. RT-qPCR verification results 
showed that Helicobacter pylori CagA caused up-regulation of BPTF, caspase3, 
CDH1, CTNNB1, and POLR2A expression.
CONCLUSION: The current comprehensive analysis provides new insights for 
exploring the effect of CagA in human gastric cancer, which could help us 
understand the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence and development of 
gastric cancer caused by Helicobacter pylori.
