The cellular mechanism by which epoxy fatty acids (EpFA) improves disease status 
is not well characterized. Previous studies suggest the involvement of cellular 
receptors and cyclic AMP (cAMP). Herein, the action of EpFAs derived from 
linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), and docosahexaenoic acid on cAMP 
levels was studied in multiple cell types to elucidate relationships between 
EpFAs, receptors and cells' origin. cAMP levels were enhanced in HEK293 and 
LLC-PK1 cells by EpFAs from LA and ARA. Using selective antagonists, the EpFA 
effects on cAMP levels appear dependent on the prostaglandin E2 receptor 2 (EP2) 
but not 4 (EP4). Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells responded similarly 
to the EpFAs. However, we were not able to show the involvement of any of the 
receptors tested in this cell type. The results pinpointed distinct cell lines 
and receptor subtypes that natively respond to EpFA.
