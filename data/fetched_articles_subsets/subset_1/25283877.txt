OBJECTIVE: There is emerging evidence that the microRNA-146a (miR-146a) 
rs2910164 polymorphism might be associated with the susceptibility to colorectal 
cancer (CRC). However, previous published studies have failed to achieve a 
definitive conclusion. We aimed to address this issue in an updated 
meta-analysis.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, 
China BioMedicine, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar to identify eligible 
studies. Case-control studies written in English that evaluated the association 
between miR-146a polymorphism and CRC were included. Odds ratio and 95% 
confidence interval were calculated in the quantitative synthesis.
RESULTS: Overall seven case-control studies including a total of 2978 cases and 
3576 cancer-free or healthy controls were enrolled in the meta-analysis. The 
results indicated that there was no association between miR-146a G/C rs2910164 
polymorphism and CRC risk either in the overall analysis or among Asians, when 
stratified on the basis of ethnicity.
CONCLUSION: miR-146a G/C genetic polymorphism was not related to the 
susceptibility to CRC.
