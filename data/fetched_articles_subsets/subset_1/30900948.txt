Lamin A, a product of the LMNA gene, is an essential nuclear envelope component 
in most differentiated cells. Mutations in LMNA have been linked to premature 
aging disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS is 
caused by progerin, an aberrant form of lamin A that leads to premature death, 
typically from the complications of atherosclerotic disease. A key 
characteristic of HGPS is a severe loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) 
in the arteries. Various mouse models of HGPS have been created, but few of them 
feature VSMC depletion and none develops atherosclerosis, the death-causing 
symptom of the disease in humans. We recently generated a mouse model that 
recapitulates most features of HGPS, including VSMC loss and accelerated 
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, by generating cell-type-specific HGPS mouse 
models, we have demonstrated a central role of VSMC loss in progerin-induced 
atherosclerosis and premature death.
