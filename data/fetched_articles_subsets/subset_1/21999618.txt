The biological surface adsorption index (BSAI) is a novel approach to 
characterize surface adsorption energy of nanomaterials that is the primary 
force behind nanoparticle aggregation, protein corona formation, and other 
complex interactions of nanomaterials within biological systems. Five 
quantitative nanodescriptors were obtained to represent the surface adsorption 
forces (hydrophobicity, hydrogen bond, polarity/polarizability, and lone-pair 
electrons) of the nanomaterial interaction with biological components. We have 
mapped the surface adsorption forces over 16 different nanomaterials. When the 
five-dimensional information of the nanodescriptors was reduced to two 
dimensions, the 16 nanomaterials were classified into distinct clusters 
according their surface adsorption properties. BSAI nanodescriptors are 
intrinsic properties of nanomaterials useful for quantitative structure-activity 
relationship (QSAR) model development. This is the first success in quantitative 
characterization of the surface adsorption forces of nanomaterials in biological 
conditions, which could open a quantitative avenue in predictive nanomedicine 
development, risk assessment, and safety evaluation of nanomaterials.
