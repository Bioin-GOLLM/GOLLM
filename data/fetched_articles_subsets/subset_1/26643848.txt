BRAF mutations at codons L597 and K601 occur uncommonly in melanoma. Clinical 
and pathological associations of these mutations were investigated in a cohort 
of 1119 patients with known BRAF mutation status. A BRAF mutation was identified 
in 435 patients; Mutations at L597 and the K601E mutation were seen in 3.4 and 
3.2% of these, respectively. K601E melanomas tended to occur in male patients, a 
median age of 58 yr, were generally found on the trunk (64%) and uncommonly 
associated with chronically sun-damaged (CSD) skin. BRAF L597 melanomas occurred 
in older patients (median 66 yr), but were associated with CSD skin (extremities 
or head and neck location - 73.3%, P = 0.001). Twenty-three percent of patients 
with V600E- and 43% of patients with K601E-mutant melanomas presented with nodal 
disease at diagnosis compared to just 14% of patients with BRAF wild-type tumors 
(P = 0.001 and 0.006, respectively). Overall, these mutations represent a 
significant minority of BRAF mutations, but have distinct clinicopathological 
phenotypes and clinical behaviors.
