The ventricular conduction system (VCS) orchestrates the harmonious contraction 
in every heartbeat. Defects in the VCS are often associated with 
life-threatening arrhythmias and also promote adverse remodeling in heart 
disease. We have previously established that the Irx3 homeobox gene regulates 
rapid electrical propagation in the VCS by modulating the transcription of gap 
junction proteins Cx40 and Cx43. However, it is unknown whether other factors 
contribute to the conduction defects observed in Irx3 knockout (Irx3(-/-)) mice. 
In this study, we show that during the early postnatal period, Irx3(-/-) mice 
develop morphological defects in the VCS which are temporally dissociated from 
changes in gap junction expression. These morphological defects were accompanied 
with progressive changes in the cardiac electrocardiogram including right bundle 
branch block. Hypoplastic VCS was not associated with increased apoptosis of VCS 
cardiomyocytes but with a lack of recruitment and maturation of ventricular 
cardiomyocytes into the VCS. Computational analysis followed by functional 
verification revealed that Irx3 promotes VCS-enriched transcripts targeted by 
Nkx2.5 and/or Tbx5. Altogether, these results indicate that, in addition to 
ensuring the appropriate expression of gap junctional channels in the VCS, Irx3 
is necessary for the postnatal maturation of the VCS, possibly via its 
interactions with Tbx5 and Nkx2.5.
