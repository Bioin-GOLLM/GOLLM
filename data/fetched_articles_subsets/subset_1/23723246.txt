The ability of proteins to establish highly selective interactions with a 
variety of (macro)molecular partners is a crucial prerequisite to the 
realization of their biological functions. The availability of computational 
tools to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein-protein binding can 
therefore be valuable in a wide range of industrial and biomedical applications, 
and help rationalize the consequences of non-synonymous single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms. BeAtMuSiC (http://babylone.ulb.ac.be/beatmusic) is a 
coarse-grained predictor of the changes in binding free energy induced by point 
mutations. It relies on a set of statistical potentials derived from known 
protein structures, and combines the effect of the mutation on the strength of 
the interactions at the interface, and on the overall stability of the complex. 
The BeAtMuSiC server requires as input the structure of the protein-protein 
complex, and gives the possibility to assess rapidly all possible mutations in a 
protein chain or at the interface, with predictive performances that are in line 
with the best current methodologies.
