An Arabidopsis mutant (rnc1) with a mutation at the 313th nucleotide from the 
translational start site of AtNRT3.1 was isolated. The mutation resulted in the 
replacement of aspartate by asparagine at the 105th amino acid in a region 
conserved among higher plants. In the rnc1 mutant, both the nitrate 
concentrations in plants and the nitrate uptake from the medium were <13% 
compared with those of the wild type, while AtNRT3.1 mRNA was accumulated 
similarly and both AtNRT1.1 and AtNRT2.1 mRNA were decreased. These results 
suggest that the replacement of Asp105 in AtNRT3.1 markedly reduces nitrate 
uptake and accumulation.
