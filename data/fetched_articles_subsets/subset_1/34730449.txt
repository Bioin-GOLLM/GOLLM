Cough is a main symptom in cystic fibrosis (CF). We aim to validate a Spanish 
version of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ-Sp) to measure the impact of 
cough in CF bronchiectasis. A prospective longitudinal multicentre study was 
performed. Internal consistency and score changes over a 15-day period in stable 
state were assessed to analyse reliability. Concurrent validity was analysed by 
correlation with Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and convergent 
validity by assessing the association with clinical variables. Changes in scores 
between stable state and the first exacerbation were assessed to analyse 
responsiveness. 132 patients (29.73 ± 10.52 years) were enrolled in four 
hospitals. Internal consistency was high for the total score and good for the 
three domains (Cronbach's α 0.81-0.93). The test-retest reliability showed an 
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.86 for the total score. The correlation 
between LCQ-Sp and SGRQ scores was -0.74. The LCQ-Sp score negatively correlated 
with sputum volume, and the mean score decreased at the beginning of 
exacerbations (16.04±3.81 vs 13.91±4.29) with a large effect size. The LCQ-Sp is 
a reliable, repeatable and responsive instrument to assess the impact of cough 
in CF bronchiectasis and is responsive to change in the event of exacerbations.
