The bacteriophage λ Q protein is a transcription antitermination factor that 
controls expression of the phage late genes as a stable component of the 
transcription elongation complex. To join the elongation complex, λQ binds a 
specific DNA sequence element and interacts with RNA polymerase that is paused 
during early elongation. λQ binds to the paused early-elongation complex through 
interactions between λQ and two regions of RNA polymerase: region 4 of the σ(70) 
subunit and the flap region of the β subunit. We present the 2.1 Å resolution 
crystal structure of a portion of λQ containing determinants for interaction 
with DNA, interaction with region 4 of σ(70), and interaction with the β flap. 
The structure provides a framework for interpreting prior genetic and 
biochemical analysis and sets the stage for future structural studies to 
elucidate the mechanism by which λQ alters the functional properties of the 
transcription elongation complex.
