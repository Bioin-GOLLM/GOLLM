BACKGROUND: Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome with characteristic facial 
gestalt and mental retardation of variable severity. Haploinsufficiency of the 
NSD1 gene has been implicated as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with a 
predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients. This study was 
conducted to investigate into the spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern 
Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome.
METHODS: Thirty-six Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome and two patients with 
Weaver syndrome were subject to molecular testing.
RESULTS: NSD1 gene mutations were detected in 26 (72%) Sotos patients. 
Microdeletion was found in only 3 patients, while the other 23 had point 
mutations (6 frameshift, 8 nonsense, 2 spice site, and 7 missense). Of these, 19 
mutations were never reported. NSD1 gene mutations were not found in the two 
patients with Weaver syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by NSD1 gene defects, but 
the spectrum of mutations is different from that of Japanese patients. 
Genotype-phenotype correlation showed that patients with microdeletions might be 
more prone to congenital heart disease but less likely to have somatic 
overgrowth. The two patients with Weaver syndrome were not found to have NSD1 
gene mutations, but the number was too small for any conclusion to be drawn.
