OBJECTIVE: To compare the distribution and assess genetic associations of the 
PTPN22 R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism among South Asian (Asiatic Indian) 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ethnically matched controls.
METHODS: DNA samples from 133 rheumatoid factor-positive South Asian RA patients 
and 149 control subjects from the East Midlands of the UK were genotyped for 
PTPN22 R620W polymorphism. Genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
RESULTS: The PTPN22 *T allele frequency was lower than in the Caucasian 
populations, but the disease association was significant (odds ratio 5.87, 95% 
confidence interval 1.68-20.52). Similar association was observed for genotypes 
containing *T allele.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the T variant acts as a susceptibility 
allele for autoantibody-positive RA among South Asians.
