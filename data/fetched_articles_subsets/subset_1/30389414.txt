Although commensal flora is involved in the regulation of immunity, the 
interplay between cytokine signaling and microbiota in atherosclerosis remains 
unknown. We found that interleukin (IL)-23 and its downstream target IL-22 
restricted atherosclerosis by repressing pro-atherogenic microbiota. 
Inactivation of IL-23-IL-22 signaling led to deterioration of the intestinal 
barrier, dysbiosis, and expansion of pathogenic bacteria with distinct 
biosynthetic and metabolic properties, causing systemic increase in 
pro-atherogenic metabolites such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and trimethylamine 
N-oxide (TMAO). Augmented disease in the absence of the IL-23-IL-22 pathway was 
mediated in part by pro-atherogenic osteopontin, controlled by microbial 
metabolites. Microbiota transfer from IL-23-deficient mice accelerated 
atherosclerosis, whereas microbial depletion or IL-22 supplementation reduced 
inflammation and ameliorated disease. Our work uncovers the IL-23-IL-22 
signaling as a regulator of atherosclerosis that restrains expansion of 
pro-atherogenic microbiota and argues for informed use of cytokine blockers to 
avoid cardiovascular side effects driven by microbiota and inflammation.
