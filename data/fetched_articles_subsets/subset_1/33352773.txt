Theranostics are emerging as a pillar of cancer therapy that enable the use of 
single molecule constructs for diagnostic and therapeutic application. As poly 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is overexpressed in 
various cancer types, and is localized to the nucleus, PARP-1 can be safely 
targeted with Auger emitters to induce DNA damage in tumors. Here, we 
investigated a radioiodinated PARP inhibitor, [125I]KX1, and show drug target 
specific DNA damage and subsequent killing of BRCA1 and non-BRCA mutant ovarian 
cancer cells at sub-pharmacological concentrations several orders of magnitude 
lower than traditional PARP inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that viable 
tumor tissue from ovarian cancer patients can be used to screen tumor 
radiosensitivity ex-vivo, enabling the direct assessment of therapeutic 
efficacy. Finally, we showed tumors can be imaged by single-photon computed 
tomography (SPECT) with PARP theranostic, [123I]KX1, in a human ovarian cancer 
xenograft mouse model. These data support the utility of PARP-1 targeted 
radiopharmaceutical therapy as a theranostic option for PARP-1 overexpressing 
ovarian cancers.
