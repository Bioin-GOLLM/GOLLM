Clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) rarely occurs in men, not to mention in 
prostate. We reported a 44-year-old male patient who suffered from recurrent 
dysuria and frequency for 6 months. Transurethral resection of the prostate was 
performed to relieve bladder outlet obstruction. However, CCA of the prostate 
was confirmed through pathological examination. A thorough checkup was performed 
to distinguish it from metastatic clear cell carcinoma from other primary 
origins. Currently, no consensus for the treatment of CCA of the prostate has 
been reached. After discussing with the patient, he decided to receive 
immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. Herein, we reported this rare case of CCA in 
the prostate.
