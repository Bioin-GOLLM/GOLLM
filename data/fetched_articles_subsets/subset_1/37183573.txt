Biallelic variants in CHST3 gene result in congenital dislocation of large 
joints, club feet, short stature, rhizomelia, kypho-scoliosis, platyspondyly, 
epiphyseal dysplasia, flared metaphysis, in addition to minor cardiac lesions 
and hearing loss. Herein, we describe 14 new patients from 11 unrelated Egyptian 
families with CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia. All patients had 
spondyloepiphyseal changes that were progressive with age in addition to bifid 
distal ends of humeri which can be considered a diagnostic key in patients with 
CHST3 variants. They also shared peculiar facies with broad forehead, broad 
nasal tip, long philtrum and short neck. Rare unusual associated findings 
included microdontia, teeth spacing, delayed eruption, prominent angulation of 
the lumbar-sacral junction and atrial septal defect. Mutational analysis 
revealed 10 different homozygous CHST3 (NM_004273.5) variants including 7 
missense, two frameshift and one nonsense variant. Of them, the c.384_391dup 
(p.Pro131Argfs*88) was recurrent in two families. Eight of these variants were 
not described before. Our study presents the largest series of patients with 
CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia from the same ethnic group. Furthermore, it 
reinforces that lethal cardiac involvement is a critical clinical finding of the 
disorder. Therefore, we believe that our study expands the phenotypic and 
mutational spectrum, and also highlights the importance of performing 
echocardiography in patients harboring CHST3 variants.
