The asymmetric unit of the title compound, [Pd(C(12)H(12)NO)(2)], consists of 
three crystallographically independent half-mol-ecules. Each Pd(II) atom lies on 
a center of inversion and is four-coordinated by two monoanionic forms of the 
amino-acryl-aldehyde in a square-planar geometry. In the crystal, adjacent 
mol-ecules are connected through C-H⋯π and C-H⋯O inter-actions into a 
three-dimensional polymeric structure.
