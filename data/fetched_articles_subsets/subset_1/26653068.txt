OBJECTIVE: Liraglutide has been shown to significantly improve glycemic control 
and reduce body weight while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia in adult 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aimed to identify 
characteristics that predict clinical and economic outcomes associated with 
liraglutide therapy in clinical practice in the US.
METHODS: Using the Truven Health MarketScan Laboratory Database, glycemic 
control (A1C <7%) and diabetes-related costs were evaluated in T2D patients 
initiating liraglutide between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2012. Patients were 
required to have ≥1 post-index claim for liraglutide and A1C values at baseline 
and 6 months follow-up. All valid values of baseline A1C were included. Patients 
previously treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist(s) or insulin, or with evidence 
of type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, or gestational diabetes during the study period 
were excluded. Multivariable regression models were used to identify predictors 
of glycemic control and diabetes-related costs.
RESULTS: Of 417 patients newly treated with liraglutide, 54.0% achieved glycemic 
control (A1C <7%) during follow-up. Factors associated with increased odds of 
glycemic control during follow-up were: being female, POS/EPO health plan type, 
baseline A1C, early liraglutide initiation (0-1 prior oral anti diabetics [OADs] 
vs ≥2), adherence to liraglutide (defined as the proportion of days covered 
[PDC]), and diabetic retinopathy. Being female, earlier liraglutide initiation 
(0-1 prior OADs), and higher patient share of liraglutide costs were associated 
with significantly lower diabetes-related costs during follow-up. Factors 
associated with significantly higher post-index diabetes-related costs were: 
higher baseline A1C, baseline use of sulfonylureas, and diabetic retinopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: Within this commercially-insured population of T2D patients treated 
with liraglutide, gender, baseline A1C, early liraglutide initiation (0-1 prior 
OADs), diabetic retinopathy, better adherence, and patient share of liraglutide 
costs were associated with increased odds of achieving glycemic control and the 
odds of having higher or lower diabetes-related costs.
