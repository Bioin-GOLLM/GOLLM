Objective.To present the first 3D CGO-based absolute EIT reconstructions from 
experimental tank data.Approach.CGO-based methods for absolute EIT imaging are 
compared to traditional TV regularized non-linear least squares reconstruction 
methods. Additional robustness testing is performed by considering incorrect 
modeling of domain shape.Main Results.The CGO-based methods are fast, and show 
strong robustness to incorrect domain modeling comparable to classic difference 
EIT imaging and fewer boundary artefacts than the TV regularized non-linear 
least squares reference reconstructions.Significance.This work is the first to 
demonstrate fully 3D CGO-based absolute EIT reconstruction on experimental data 
and also compares to TV-regularized absolute reconstruction. The speed (1-5 s) 
and quality of the reconstructions is encouraging for future work in absolute 
EIT.
