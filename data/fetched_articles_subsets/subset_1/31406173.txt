Telomere shortening has been associated with multiple age-related diseases such 
as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dementia. However, the biological 
mechanisms responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. In order 
to gain insight into the metabolic processes driving the association of 
leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with age-related diseases, we investigated the 
association between LTL and serum metabolite levels in 7,853 individuals from 
seven independent cohorts. LTL was determined by quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and the levels of 131 serum metabolites were measured with mass 
spectrometry in biological samples from the same blood draw. With partial 
correlation analysis, we identified six metabolites that were significantly 
associated with LTL after adjustment for multiple testing: 
lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 (lysoPC a C17:0, p-value = 7.1 × 10-6), 
methionine (p-value = 9.2 × 10-5), tyrosine (p-value = 2.1 × 10-4), 
phosphatidylcholine diacyl C32:1 (PC aa C32:1, p-value = 2.4 × 10-4), 
hydroxypropionylcarnitine (C3-OH, p-value = 2.6 × 10-4), and phosphatidylcholine 
acyl-alkyl C38:4 (PC ae C38:4, p-value = 9.0 × 10-4). Pathway analysis showed 
that the three phosphatidylcholines and methionine are involved in homocysteine 
metabolism and we found supporting evidence for an association of lipid 
metabolism with LTL. In conclusion, we found longer LTL associated with higher 
levels of lysoPC a C17:0 and PC ae C38:4, and with lower levels of methionine, 
tyrosine, PC aa C32:1, and C3-OH. These metabolites have been implicated in 
inflammation, oxidative stress, homocysteine metabolism, and in cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes, two major drivers of morbidity and mortality.
