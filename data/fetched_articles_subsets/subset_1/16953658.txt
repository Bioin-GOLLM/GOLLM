BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis (meningitis caused by 
Neisseria meningitidis) are a major public health concern in the African 
"meningitis belt," which includes 21 countries from Senegal to Ethiopia. Of the 
several species that can cause meningitis, N. meningitidis is the most important 
cause of epidemics in this region. In choosing the appropriate vaccine, accurate 
N. meningitidis serogroup determination is key. To this end, we developed and 
evaluated two duplex rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for detecting N. meningitidis 
polysaccharide (PS) antigens of several important serogroups.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies against N. meningitidis PS 
A, W135/Y, Y, and C were used to develop two immunochromatography duplex RDTs, 
RDT1 (to detect serogroups A and W135/Y) and RDT2 (to detect serogroups C and 
Y). Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy criteria were used to 
determine diagnostic accuracy of RDTs on reference strains and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) samples using culture and PCR, respectively, as reference tests. The 
cutoffs were 10(5) cfu/ml for reference strains and 1 ng/ml for PS. 
Sensitivities and specificities were 100% for reference strains, and 93.8%-100% 
for CSF serogroups A, W135, and Y in CSF. For CSF serogroup A, the positive and 
negative likelihood ratios (+/- 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 31.867 
(16.1-63.1) and 0.065 (0.04-0.104), respectively, and the diagnostic odds ratio 
(+/- 95% CI) was 492.9 (207.2-1,172.5). For CSF serogroups W135 and Y, the 
positive likelihood ratio was 159.6 (51.7-493.3) Both RDTs were equally reliable 
at 25 degrees C and 45 degrees C.
CONCLUSIONS: These RDTs are important new bedside diagnostic tools for 
surveillance of meningococcus serogroups A and W135, the two serogroups that are 
responsible for major epidemics in Africa.
