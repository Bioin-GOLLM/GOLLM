BACKGROUND: Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) of recessive monogenic diseases 
depends heavily on knowing the correct parental haplotypes. However, the 
currently used family-based haplotyping method requires pedigrees, and molecular 
haplotyping is highly challenging due to its high cost, long turnaround time, 
and complexity. Here, we proposed a new two-step approach, population-based 
haplotyping-NIPT (PBH-NIPT), using α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia as 
prototypes.
METHODS: First, we deduced parental haplotypes with Beagle 4.0 with training on 
a large retrospective carrier screening dataset (4356 thalassemia carrier 
screening-positive cases). Second, we inferred fetal haplotypes using a parental 
haplotype-assisted hidden Markov model (HMM) and the Viterbi algorithm.
RESULTS: With this approach, we enrolled 59 couples at risk of having a fetus 
with thalassemia and successfully inferred 94.1% (111/118) of fetal alleles. We 
confirmed these alleles by invasive prenatal diagnosis, with 99.1% (110/111) 
accuracy (95% CI, 95.1-100%).
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PBH-NIPT is a sensitive, fast, and 
inexpensive strategy for NIPT of thalassemia.
