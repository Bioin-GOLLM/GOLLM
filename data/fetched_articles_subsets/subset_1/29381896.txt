OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether spermine supplementation could 
regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, and amino acid transporter-related genes 
expression in the thymus and spleen of early weaned piglets.
METHODS: Eighty female piglets were randomly distributed to receive adequate 
nutrients supplemented with spermine (0.4 mmol/kg body weight/24 h) or to be 
provided with restricted nourishment supplemented with normal saline for 7 h or 
3, 6, or 9 d in pairs.
RESULTS: Regardless of administration time, spermine supplementation 
significantly up-regulated cyclin A2 gene expression but down-regulated p21 and 
cyclin D3 mRNA levels in the thymus and spleen and reduced cyclin E2 gene 
expression in the thymus of piglets (p&lt; 0.05). Irrespective of the treatment 
period, the reduced Bax and caspase-3 gene expressions and improved Bcl-2 mRNA 
level were observed in the thymus and spleen of spermine-administrated piglets 
(p&lt;0.05). Regardless of supplementation time, spermine intake significantly 
enhanced the expressions of amino acid transporter-related genes (SLC1A1, 
SLC1A5, SLC7A1, SLC7A7, and SLC15A1) in both thymus and spleen, as well as 
SLC7A9 in the spleen of piglets (p&lt;0.05). In addition, extended spermine 
administration also markedly promoted cell proliferation, depressed apoptosis 
and modulated amino acid transport (p&lt; 0.05), and such effects were the 
greatest during prolonged spermine supplementation (6 d) compared to the other 
time periods (p&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Spermine supplementation may regulate cell cycle during the G1/S 
phase, suppress apoptosis and modulate amino acid transport. A period of 6 d of 
spermine supplementation is required to produce the optimal effects on 
nutritional implications.
