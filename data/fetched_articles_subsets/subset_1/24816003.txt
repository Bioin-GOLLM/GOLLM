BACKGROUND: The relative risk of developing idiopathic PD is 1.5 times greater 
in men than in women, but an increased female prevalence in LRRK2-carriers has 
been described in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We report an update about the 
frequency of major LRRK2 mutations in a large series of consecutive patients 
with Parkinson's disease (PD), including extensive characterization of clinical 
features. In particular, we investigated gender-related differences in motor and 
non-motor symptoms in the LRRK2 population.
METHODS: 2976 unrelated consecutive Italian patients with degenerative 
Parkinsonism were screened for mutations on exon 41 (G2019S, I2020T) and a 
subgroup of 1190 patients for mutations on exon 31 (R1441C/G/H). Demographic and 
clinical features were compared between LRRK2-carriers and non-carriers, and 
between male and female LRRK2 mutation carriers.
RESULTS: LRRK2 mutations were identified in 40 of 2523 PD patients (1.6%) and 
not in other primary parkinsonian syndromes. No major clinical differences were 
found between LRRK2-carriers and non-carriers. We found a novel I2020L missense 
variant, predicted to be pathogenic. Female gender was more common amongst 
carriers than non-carriers (57% vs. 40%; p = 0.01), without any gender-related 
difference in clinical features. Family history of PD was more common in women 
in the whole PD group, regardless of their LRRK2 status.
CONCLUSIONS: PD patients with LRRK2 mutations are more likely to be women, 
suggesting a stronger genetic load compared to idiopathic PD. Further studies 
are needed to elucidate whether there is a different effect of gender on the 
balance between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of PD.
