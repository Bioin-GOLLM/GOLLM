BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with 
cardiovascular disease and is a significant risk factor for increased morbidity 
and mortality. In contrast, GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation has been shown to 
confer both renal and cardiovascular protection, though its relationship with 
CKD and CKD with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) remains poorly 
understood. Here, we investigated changes in renal and myocardial GLP-1R 
expression in the CKD rat model with MI/R.
METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats with 5/6 nephrectomy were used as a rat model 
of CKD and CKD with MI/R. For myocardial ischemia, the left coronary artery was 
ligated and released for 30 min 1 week after 5/6 nephrectomy. 
Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors were administered orally with 
linagliptin once daily for 8 weeks. Renal cortical and myocardial GLP-1R 
expression were measured via immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.
RESULTS: DPP-4 activity was increased in CKD. Western blot density of GLP-1R in 
renal cortex extracts revealed increased abundance 2 weeks after 5/6 
nephrectomy, followed by a decrease at 8 weeks. In contrast, CKD and CKD with 
MI/R rats showed decreases in renal and cardiac expression of GLP-1R; these 
effects were attenuated in rats treated with linagliptin.
CONCLUSIONS: In CKD with MI/R, linagliptin attenuated renal injury and increased 
renal and myocardial GLP-1R expression. These data suggest that activation of 
renal and myocardial GLP-1R expression may provide both cardio- and 
renoprotective effects.
