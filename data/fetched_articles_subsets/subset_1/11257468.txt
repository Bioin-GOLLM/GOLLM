The complete dystrophin mRNA sequence has been analyzed in 20 Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy patients. In 13 cases, deletions in mRNA 
were detected using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in 
another seven cases, point mutations were found using the protein truncation 
test. Sixteen patients diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy showed the 
presence of deletions or of nonsense point mutations. From four patients with 
the Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype, three cases were associated with 
deletions conserving the translational frame and one was associated with a 
nonsense mutation E1110X. In the case of the E1110X mutation, an alternative 
splicing of dystrophin mRNA (3485-3640del) was detected in this patient which 
included the E1110X mutation site (nucleotide 3536) and did not change the 
translation reading frame. Individual nonsense point mutations were 
characterized by sequence analysis, which showed five novel mutations with 
respect to those reported in the Cardiff Human Gene Mutation Database 
http://uwcm.web.cf.ac.uk/uwcm/mg/hgmd0.html and the Leiden muscular dystrophy 
pages http://www.dmd.nl/.
