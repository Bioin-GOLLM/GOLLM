AIM: The relationship between the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
A1298C polymorphism and the susceptibility of diabetes remains inclusive or 
controversial. For better understanding of the influence of MTHFR A1298C 
polymorphism on diabetes risk, we performed this meta-analysis.
METHODS: All related articles were identified through a search of PubMed, 
Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM, Chinese), China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wangfang Database (Chinese). The 
relationship between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and diabetes susceptibility 
was conducted by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Total of six studies with 897 cases and 852 controls were included in 
our meta-analysis. Overall, the significance associated was found between MTHFR 
A1298C polymorphism and the susceptibility of diabetes under recessive model (CC 
vs.
AC/AA: OR=1.70, 95% CI=1.18-2.45, p=0.004). On the subgroup analysis according 
to ethnicity, the results indicated that MTHFR A1298C polymorphism has a 
significant association with diabetes in Asian population under dominant model 
(CC/AC vs. AA: OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.003-1.72, p=0.047). However, there was no 
association found between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and diabetes susceptibility 
in Caucasians.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is a 
dangerous factor for diabetes, especially for Asians.
