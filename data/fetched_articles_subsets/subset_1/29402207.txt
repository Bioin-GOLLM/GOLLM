A 1-month-old Purebred Spanish Horse (PSH) foal presented with progressive 
hepatic failure culminating in death. Hepatic lesions were consistent with 
congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF). Genetic studies in the PKHD1 gene in the 
affected foal revealed that it was heterozygous for the 2 previously described 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to CHF in Swiss Franches-Montagnes 
(SFM) horses. In addition, 2 novel mutations were detected, the foal being 
homozygous for one of them and heterozygous for the other. Genetic studies in a 
healthy PSH population ( n = 35) showed a 3-fold higher genotypic frequency for 
PKHD1 SNP g.49,630,834G>A and a 5-fold higher genotypic frequency for PKHD1 SNP 
g.49,597,760A>T compared with those reported for SFM horses. SNPs in the PKHD1 
gene in CHF-affected SFM horses might not fully explain the CHF observed in the 
PSH. Other mutations in the PKHD1 gene could play a more important role in the 
PSH.
