Clostridium perfringens causes one of the most common foodborne illnesses, which 
is largely mediated by the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). The toxin 
consists of two functional domains. The N-terminal region mediates the cytotoxic 
effect through pore formation in the plasma membrane of the mammalian host cell. 
The C-terminal region (cCPE) binds to the second extracellular loop of a subset 
of claudins. Claudin-3 and claudin-4 have been shown to be receptors for CPE 
with very high affinity. The toxin binds with weak affinity to claudin-1 and -2 
but contribution of these weak binding claudins to CPE-mediated disease is 
questionable. cCPE is not cytotoxic, however, it is a potent modulator of tight 
junctions. This review describes recent progress in the molecular 
characterization of the cCPE-claudin interaction using mutagenesis, in vitro 
binding assays and permeation studies. The results promote the development of 
recombinant cCPE-proteins and CPE-based peptidomimetics to modulate tight 
junctions for improved drug delivery or to treat tumors overexpressing claudins.
