Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel encoded by the gene SCN5A can result in 
a wide array of phenotypes. We report a case of a young male with a novel SCN5A 
mutation (R121W) afflicted by sick sinus syndrome, progressive cardiac 
conduction disorder, atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. His father 
carried the same mutation, but had a milder phenotype, presenting with 
progressive cardiac conduction later in life. The mutation was found to result 
in a loss-of-function in the sodium current. In conclusion, the same SCN5A 
mutation can result in a wide array of clinical phenotypes and perhaps the 
spectrum of SCN5A loss-of-function associated disease entities should be viewed 
as one syndrome.
