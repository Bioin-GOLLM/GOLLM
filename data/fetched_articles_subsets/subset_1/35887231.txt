Helicobacter pylori, a significant human gastric pathogen, has been 
demonstrating increased antibiotic resistance, causing difficulties in infection 
treatment. It is therefore important to develop alternatives or complementary 
approaches to antibiotics to tackle H. pylori infections, and (bacterio)phages 
have proven to be effective antibacterial agents. In this work, prophage 
isolation was attempted using H. pylori strains and UV radiation. One phage was 
isolated and further characterized to assess potential phage-inspired 
therapeutic alternatives to H. pylori infections. HPy1R is a new podovirus 
prophage with a genome length of 31,162 bp, 37.1% GC, encoding 36 predicted 
proteins, of which 17 were identified as structural. Phage particles remained 
stable at 37 °C, from pH 3 to 11, for 24 h in standard assays. Moreover, when 
submitted to an in vitro gastric digestion model, only a small decrease was 
observed in the gastric phase, suggesting that it is adapted to the gastric 
tract environment. Together with its other characteristics, its capability to 
suppress H. pylori population levels for up to 24 h post-infection at 
multiplicities of infection of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 suggests that this newly 
isolated phage is a potential candidate for phage therapy in the absence of 
strictly lytic phages.
