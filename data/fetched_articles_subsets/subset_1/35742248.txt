The rapid growth of mHealth applications for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) 
patients' self-management has motivated the evaluation of these applications 
from both the usability and user point of view. The objective of this study was 
to identify mHealth applications that focus on T2DM from the Android store and 
rate them from the usability perspective using the MARS tool. Additionally, a 
classification of these mHealth applications was conducted using the ID3 
algorithm to identify the most preferred application. The usability of the 
applications was assessed by two experts using MARS. A total of 11 mHealth 
applications were identified from the initial search, which fulfilled our 
inclusion criteria. The usability of the applications was rated using the MARS 
scale, from 1 (inadequate) to 5 (excellent). The Functionality (3.23) and 
Aesthetics (3.22) attributes had the highest score, whereas Information (3.1) 
had the lowest score. Among the 11 applications, "mySugr" had the highest 
average MARS score for both Application Quality (4.1/5) as well as Application 
Subjective Quality (4.5/5). Moreover, from the classification conducted using 
the ID3 algorithm, it was observed that 6 out of 11 mHealth applications were 
preferred for the self-management of T2DM.
