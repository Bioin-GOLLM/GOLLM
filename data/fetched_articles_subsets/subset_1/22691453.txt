Atrophy of neurons and gross structural alterations of limbic brain regions, 
including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, have been reported in 
brain imaging and postmortem studies of depressed patients. Preclinical findings 
have suggested that prolonged negative stress can induce changes comparable to 
those seen in major depressive disorder (MDD), through dendritic retraction and 
decreased spine density in PFC and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. 
Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that environmental and 
pharmacological manipulations, including antidepressant medication, exercise, 
and diet, can block or even reverse many of the molecular changes induced by 
stress, providing a clear link between these factors and susceptibility to MDD. 
In this review, we will discuss the environmental and pharmacological factors, 
as well as the contribution of genetic polymorphisms, involved in the regulation 
of neuronal morphology and plasticity in MDD and preclinical stress models. In 
particular, we will highlight the pro-depressive changes incurred by stress and 
the reversal of these changes by antidepressants, exercise, and diet.
