During recent years, evidence has emerged that immune privileged sites such as 
the CNS and the retina may be more integrated in the systemic response to 
infection than was previously believed. In line with this, it was recently shown 
that a systemic acute virus infection leads to infiltration of CD8 T cells in 
the brains of immunocompetent mice. In this study, we extend these findings to 
the neurological tissue of the eye, namely the retina. We show that an acute 
systemic virus infection in mice leads to a transient CD8 T cell infiltration in 
the retina that is not directed by virus infection inside the retina. CD8 T 
cells were found throughout the retinal tissue, and had a high expression of 
CXCR6 and CXCR3, as also reported for tissue residing CD8 T cells in the lung 
and liver. We also show that the pigment epithelium lining the retina expresses 
CXCL16 (the ligand for CXCR6) similar to epithelial cells of the lung. Thus, our 
results suggest that the retina undergoes immune surveillance during a systemic 
infection, and that this surveillance appears to be directed by mechanisms 
similar to those described for non-privileged tissues.
