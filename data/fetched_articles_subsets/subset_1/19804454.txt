Gain-of-function mutations of kit tyrosine kinase receptor are associated with 
mastocytosis. Two subclones of the HMC1 mast leukaemia cell line were used; both 
express an identical KIT allele-specific regulatory type mutation (V560G), but 
differ in that one also expresses an enzymatic site type mutation (D816V) that 
confers on them resistance to imatinib mesylate tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In 
both cell lines, proliferation was suppressed and apoptosis induced by the 
combination of KIT gene silencing and alpha-tocopherol succinate (alpha-TOS), a 
derivate of alpha-tocopherol, also known as vitamin E. Furthermore, HMC1 cells 
with decreased kit levels by KIT silencing, failed to form tumours when 
xenotransplanted into immunocompromised mice and the animals were treated 
systemically with alpha-TOS. Targeting kit in the presence of alpha-TOS 
represents a new approach against proliferation of human mast leukaemia cell 
lines.
