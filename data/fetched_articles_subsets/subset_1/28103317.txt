While wild type polio has been nearly eradicated there will be a need to 
continue immunisation programmes for some time because of the possibility of 
re-emergence and the existence of long term excreters of poliovirus. All 
vaccines in current use depend on growth of virus and most of the 
non-replicating (inactivated) vaccines involve wild type viruses known to cause 
poliomyelitis. The attenuated vaccine strains involved in the eradication 
programme have been used to develop new inactivated vaccines as production is 
thought safer. However it is known that the Sabin vaccine strains are 
genetically unstable and can revert to a virulent transmissible form. A possible 
solution to the need for virus growth would be to generate empty viral capsids 
by recombinant technology, but hitherto such particles are so unstable as to be 
unusable. We report here the genetic manipulation of the virus to generate 
stable empty capsids for all three serotypes. The particles are shown to be 
extremely stable and to generate high levels of protective antibodies in animal 
models.
