BACKGROUND: The BRCA2 and MRE11 proteins participate in the repair of 
double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination. Germline BRCA2 mutations 
predispose to ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancer, while a germline MRE11 
mutation is associated with an ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder. Somatic 
mutations of BRCA2 are rare in typical sporadic cancers. In tumors having 
microsatellite instability (MSI), somatic truncating mutations in a poly [A] 
tract of BRCA2 are reported on occasion.
RESULTS: We analyzed gastrointestinal MSI cancers by whole gene BRCA2 
sequencing, finding heterozygous truncating mutations in seven (47%) of 15 
patients. There was no cellular functional defect in RAD51 focus-formation in 
three heterozygously mutated lines studied, although other potential functions 
of the BRCA2 protein could still be affected. A prior report of mutations in 
primary MSI tumors affecting the IVS5-(5-15) poly [T] tract of the MRE11 gene 
was confirmed and extended by analysis of the genomic sequence and protein 
expression in MSI cancer cell lines. Statistical analysis of the published MRE11 
mutation rate in MSI tumors did not provide evidence for a selective pressure 
favoring biallelic mutations at this repeat.
CONCLUSION: Perhaps conflicting with common suspicions, the data are not 
compatible with selective pressures during tumorigenesis promoting the 
functional loss of BRCA2 and MRE11 in MSI tumors. Instead, these data fit 
closely with an absence of selective pressures acting on BRCA2 and MRE11 gene 
status during tumorigenesis.
