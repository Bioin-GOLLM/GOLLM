The enhanced concern of the consumers regarding the safety, quality of the food 
products, and avoidance of the use of chemical food preservatives has resulted 
in a breakthrough in biopreservation. This has resulted in the use of beneficial 
microbial species, including bacteria and their secondary metabolites, to 
enhance the shelf-life and quality of the food products. Meat preservation and 
fortification are among the biggest concerns, as they are relevant to the 
majority of food products. The chemical preservatives conventionally used in 
preserving meat and meat products possess several detrimental effects on the 
consumers. Thus, alternative strategies are needed to combat strategically in 
facilitating the shelf-life and quality. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are 
considered the safest organism and have a profound role in food and 
food-processing industries. The biofilm developed by the bacteria prevents the 
growth of various undesirable microorganisms on meat and meat products. Various 
studies depicted that LAB produces various antimicrobial metabolites that can 
act effectively on the food-degrading pathogens, rendering it safe and enhancing 
shelf-life. This review, thus, deals with the use of LAB as biopreservatives for 
enhancing the shelf-life of meat and meat products and helping its 
fortification.
