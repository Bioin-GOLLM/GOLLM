It is known that the guanine-rich strands in proto-oncogene promoters can fold 
into G-quadruplex structures to regulate gene expression. An intramolecular 
parallel G-quadruplex has been identified in MET promoter. It acts as a 
repressor in regulating MET expression. However, the full guanine-rich region in 
MET promoter forms a hybrid parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex structure under 
physiological conditions, which means there are some antiparallel and hybrid 
parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex structures in this region. In the present 
study, our data indicate that g3-5 truncation adopts an intramolecular hybrid 
parallel/antiparallel G-quadruplex under physiological conditions in vitro The 
g3-5 G-quadruplex structure significantly stops polymerization by Klenow 
fragment in K+ buffer. Furthermore, the results of circular dichroism (CD) 
spectra and polymerase stop assay directly demonstrate that the G-quadruplex 
structure in g3-5 fragment can be stabilized by the G-quadruplex ligand TMPyP4 
(5,10,15,20-tetra-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphine). But the dual luciferase assay 
indicates TMPyP4 has no effect on the formation of g3-5 G-quadruplex in HepG2 
cells. The findings in the present study will enrich our understanding of the 
G-quadruplex formation in proto-oncogene promoters and the mechanisms of gene 
expression regulation.
