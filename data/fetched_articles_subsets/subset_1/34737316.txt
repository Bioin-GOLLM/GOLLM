Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) are molecular parasites that 
hijack helper phages for their transfer. SaPIbov5, the prototypical member of a 
family of cos type SaPIs, redirects the assembly of ϕ12 helper capsids from 
prolate to isometric. This size and shape shift is dependent on the 
SaPIbov5-encoded protein Ccm, a homolog of the ϕ12 capsid protein (CP). Using 
cryo-electron microscopy, we have determined structures of prolate ϕ12 
procapsids and isometric SaPIbov5 procapsids. ϕ12 procapsids have icosahedral 
end caps with Tend = 4 architecture and a Tmid = 14 cylindrical midsection, 
whereas SaPIbov5 procapsids have T = 4 icosahedral architecture. We built atomic 
models for CP and Ccm, and show that Ccm occupies the pentameric capsomers in 
the isometric SaPIbov5 procapsids, suggesting that preferential incorporation of 
Ccm pentamers prevents the cylindrical midsection from forming. Our results 
highlight that pirate elements have evolved diverse mechanisms to suppress phage 
multiplication, including the acquisition of phage capsid protein homologs.
