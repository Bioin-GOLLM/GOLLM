This article reviews the current state of understanding of the regulated 
transcription of the bacteriophage T4 late genes, with a focus on the underlying 
biochemical mechanisms, which turn out to be unique to the T4-related family of 
phages or significantly different from other bacterial systems. The activator of 
T4 late transcription is the gene 45 protein (gp45), the sliding clamp of the T4 
replisome. Gp45 becomes topologically linked to DNA through the action of its 
clamp-loader, but it is not site-specifically DNA-bound, as other 
transcriptional activators are. Gp45 facilitates RNA polymerase recruitment to 
late promoters by interacting with two phage-encoded polymerase subunits: gp33, 
the co-activator of T4 late transcription; and gp55, the T4 late promoter 
recognition protein. The emphasis of this account is on the sites and mechanisms 
of actions of these three proteins, and on their roles in the formation of 
transcription-ready open T4 late promoter complexes.
