As orchestrators of essential cellular processes like proliferation, ERK1/2 
mitogen-activated protein kinase signals impact on cell cycle regulation. A-type 
lamins are major constituents of the nuclear matrix that also control the cell 
cycle machinery by largely unknown mechanisms. In this paper, we disclose a 
functional liaison between ERK1/2 and lamin A whereby cell cycle progression is 
regulated. We demonstrate that lamin A serves as a mutually exclusive dock for 
ERK1/2 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Our results reveal that, immediately 
after their postactivation entrance in the nucleus, ERK1/2 dislodge Rb from its 
interaction with lamin A, thereby facilitating its rapid phosphorylation and 
consequently promoting E2F activation and cell cycle entry. Interestingly, these 
effects are independent of ERK1/2 kinase activity. We also show that cellular 
transformation and tumor cell proliferation are dependent on the balance between 
lamin A and nuclear ERK1/2 levels, which determines Rb accessibility for 
phosphorylation/inactivation.
