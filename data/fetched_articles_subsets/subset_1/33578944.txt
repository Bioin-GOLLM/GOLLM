Lung cancer is a well-known malignant tumor of the respiratory tract, which has 
caused a significant level of damage to human health in the 21st century. 
Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are tiny, non-coding RNA stem-loop structures with a length 
of roughly 20-25 nucleotides that function as powerful modulators of mRNA and 
protein products of a gene. miRNAs may modulate many biological processes 
involving growth, differentiation, proliferation, and cell death and play a key 
role in the pathogenesis of various types of malignancies. Several accumulating 
pieces of evidence have proven that miRNA, especially miR-146a, are crucial 
modulators of innate immune response sequences. A novel and exciting cancer 
research field has involved miRNA for the detection and suppression of cancer. 
However, the actual mechanism which is adopted by these miRNA is still unclear. 
miRNAs have been used as a cancer-associated biomarker in several studies, 
suggesting their altered expression in various cancers compared to the normal 
cells. The amount of expression of miRNA can also be used to determine the stage 
of the disease, aiding in early detection. In breast, pancreatic, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, cancer cell proliferation and 
metastasis has been suppressed by miR-146a. Changes in miR-146a expression 
levels have biomarker importance and possess a high potential as a therapeutic 
target in lung cancer. It retards epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes 
the therapeutic action of anticancer agents in lung cancer. Studies have also 
suggested that miR-146a affects gene expression through different signaling 
pathways viz. TNF-α, NF-κB and MEK-1/2, and JNK-1/2. Further research is 
required for understanding the molecular mechanisms of miR-146a in lung cancer. 
The potential role of miR-146a as a diagnostic marker of lung cancer must also 
be analyzed. This review summarizes the tumor-suppressing, anti-inflammatory, 
and antichemoresistive nature of miR-146a in lung cancer.
