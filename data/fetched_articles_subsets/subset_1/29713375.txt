BACKGROUND: Evolution of complex phenotypes in cells requires simultaneously 
tuning expression of large amounts of genes, which can be achieved by 
reprograming global transcription. Lipophilicity is an important complex trait 
in oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. It is necessary to explore the changes 
of which genes' expression levels will tune cellular lipophilic properties via 
the strategy of global transcription engineering.
RESULTS: We achieved a strategy of global transcription engineering in Y. 
lipolytica by modifying the sequences of a key transcriptional factor (TF), 
SPT15-like (Yl-SPT15). The combinatorial mutagenesis of this gene was achieved 
by DNA assembly of up to five expression cassettes of its error-prone PCR 
libraries. A heterologous beta-carotene biosynthetic pathway was constructed to 
research the effects of combined Yl-SPT15 mutants on carotene and lipid 
production. As a result, we obtained both an "enhanced" strain with 4.7-fold 
carotene production and a "weakened" strain with 0.13-fold carotene production 
relative to the initial strain, nearly 40-fold changing range. Genotype 
verification, comparative transcriptome analysis, and detection of the amounts 
of total and free fatty acids were made for the selected strains, indicating 
effective tuning of cells' lipophilic properties. We exploited the key pathways 
including RNA polymerase, ketone body metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and 
degradation that drastically determined cells' variable lipophilicity.
CONCLUSIONS: We have examined the effects of combinatorial mutagenesis of 
Yl-SPT15 on cells' capacity of producing beta-carotene and lipids. The 
lipophilic properties in Y. lipolytica could be effectively tuned by 
simultaneously regulating genome-wide multi-gene expression levels. The 
exploited gene targets and pathways could guide design and reconstruction of 
yeast cells for tunable and optimal production of other lipophilic products.
