Hereditary and acquired thrombophilia are risk factors for venous 
thromboembolism (VTE). Whether testing helps guide management decisions is 
controversial. These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of 
Hematology (ASH) intend to support decision making about thrombophilia testing. 
ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel covering clinical and 
methodological expertise and minimizing bias from conflicts of interest. The 
McMaster University GRADE Centre provided logistical support, performed 
systematic reviews, and created evidence profiles and evidence-to-decision 
tables. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
approach (GRADE) was used. Recommendations were subject to public comment. The 
panel agreed on 23 recommendations regarding thrombophilia testing and 
associated management. Nearly all recommendations are based on very low 
certainty in the evidence due to modeling assumptions. The panel issued a strong 
recommendation against testing the general population before starting combined 
oral contraceptives (COCs) and conditional recommendations for thrombophilia 
testing in the following scenarios: (a) patients with VTE associated with 
nonsurgical major transient or hormonal risk factors; (b) patients with cerebral 
or splanchnic venous thrombosis, in settings where anticoagulation would 
otherwise be discontinued; (c) individuals with a family history of 
antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency when considering 
thromboprophylaxis for minor provoking risk factors and for guidance to avoid 
COCs/hormone replacement therapy; (d) pregnant women with a family history of 
high-risk thrombophilia types; and (e) patients with cancer at low or 
intermediate risk of thrombosis and with a family history of VTE. For all other 
questions, the panel provided conditional recommendations against testing for 
thrombophilia.
