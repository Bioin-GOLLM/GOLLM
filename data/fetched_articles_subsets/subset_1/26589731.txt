BACKGROUND: The evolution of insecticide resistance in Spodoptera frugiperda 
(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) has resulted in large economic losses and disturbances 
to the environment and agroecosystems. Resistance to lufenuron, a chitin 
biosynthesis inhibitor insecticide, was recently documented in Brazilian 
populations of S. frugiperda. Thus, we utilized large-scale cDNA sequencing 
(RNA-Seq analysis) to compare the pattern of gene expression between 
lufenuron-resistant (LUF-R) and susceptible (LUF-S) S. larvae in an attempt to 
identify the molecular basis behind the resistance mechanism(s) of S. frugiperda 
to this insecticide.
RESULTS: A transcriptome was assembled using approximately 19.6 million 100 
bp-long single-end reads, which generated 18,506 transcripts with a N50 of 996 
bp. A search against the NCBI non-redundant database generated 51.1% (9,457) 
functionally annotated transcripts. A large portion of the alignments were 
homologous to insects, with the majority (45%) being similar to sequences of 
Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae). Moreover, 10% of the alignments were 
similar to sequences of various species of Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), 
with 3% of them being similar to sequences of S. frugiperda. A comparative 
analysis of the gene expression between LUF-R and LUF-S S. frugiperda larvae 
identified 940 differentially expressed transcripts (p ≤ 0.05, t-test; fold 
change ≥ 4). Six of them were associated with cuticle metabolism. Of those, four 
were overexpressed in LUF-R larvae. The machinery involved with the 
detoxification process was represented by 35 differentially expressed 
transcripts; 24 of them belonging to P450 monooxygenases, four to 
glutathione-S-transferases, six to carboxylases and one to sulfotransferases. 
RNA-Seq analysis was validated for a number of selected candidate transcripts by 
using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR).
CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression profile of LUF-R larvae of S. frugiperda 
differs from LUF-S larvae. In general, gene expression is much higher in 
resistant larvae when compared to the susceptible ones, particularly for those 
genes involved with pathways for xenobiotic detoxification, mainly represented 
by P450 monooxygenases transcripts. Our data indicate that enzymes involved with 
the detoxification process, and mostly the P450, are one of the resistance 
mechanisms employed by the LUF-R S. frugiperda larvae against lufenuron.
