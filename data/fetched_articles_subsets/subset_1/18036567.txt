More and more evidence indicates that N-glycan regulates signal transduction by 
modulating receptor functions. Previous studies suggested that glycosylation of 
EGFR is involved in dimerization and endocytosis. We further determined the role 
of N-glycosylation of ErbB family. A series of human ErbB3 mutants that lack 
each of the 10 N-glycosylation sites were prepared and transfected to Flp-In-CHO 
cells for stable expression. A crosslinking study showed that Asn 418 to Gln 
mutant (N418Q) of ErbB3 underwent autodimerization without its ligand, 
heregulin, and the heterodimer formation with ErbB2 was also increased. The 
N418Q mutant of ErbB3 co-expressed with ErbB2 promoted downstream signaling, 
anchorage-independent cell growth and the tumor growth in athymic mice. These 
findings suggest that the specific N-glycan in domain III of ErbB family plays 
an essential role in regulating receptor dimerization and transforming activity. 
We assume that the N-glycans affect the conformation of ErbB family, which is 
crucial for their activity. Together with findings from other laboratories, it 
is suggested that N-glycosylation controls ErbB signaling by various mechanisms.
