BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare clonal disease, 
characterized by hyperproliferation of Langerhans cells. It may rarely involve 
the thyroid gland. Its association with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is 
extremely rare; with only few case reports available in the English literature. 
BRAF mutations are implicated in the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 
and have also been identified in Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a rare case of a 36-year-old Indonesian 
female patient with dysphagia associated with neck mass which was complicated by 
skin sinus formation. The diagnosis of PTC was rendered on fine needle 
aspiration (FNA). Debulking thyroidectomy revealed co-existeence of PTC and LCH. 
On subsequent molecular testing, BRAF V600E and V600K mutations were detected in 
tissues macrodissected from both lesions, respectively. To the best of our 
knowledge, this case is the first case to report two different BRAF mutations in 
tissues of a Langerhans cell histiocytosis and a papillary thyroid carcinoma 
co-existing in the thyroid gland. The patient received chemotherapy of etoposide 
combined with prednisone. At the most recent follow-up, the patient is in a 
stable clinical condition.
CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of a PTC with LCH harboring BRAF mutation may 
suggest etiologic relation between the two conditions that involves the BRAF 
gene. Clinically, it may suggest an aggressive, locally advanced thyroid cancer, 
an impression that may reflect on the selected surgical management, chemotherapy 
and BRAF mutation-targeting therapy to these patients.
