In the title compound, C(22)H(24)N(4)S, the methylphenyl and isobutylphenyl 
rings are inclined at an angle of 79.98 (1)° and they form dihedral angles of 
4.59 (1) and 75.47 (1)°, respectively, with the triazolothia-diazole unit. An 
intra-molecular C-H⋯S hydrogen bond generates an S(5) ring motif. The crystal 
structure is stabilized by inter-molecular C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds and weak C-H⋯π 
and π-π inter-actions [centroid-centroid distances between the thia-diazole ring 
and a symmetry-related phenyl ring and between the triazole ring and the phenyl 
ring range from 3.5680 (8) to 3.7313 (8) Å].
