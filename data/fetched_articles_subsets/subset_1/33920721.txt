Thyrotoxicosis is an adverse event associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICPis) that occurs in 0.6 to 3.2% of treated patients, depending on ICPi class. 
Presentation usually consists of a biphasic thyroiditis with transient 
thyrotoxicosis and secondary hypothyroidism. ICPi-induced Graves' disease (GD), 
due to the stimulating activity of TSH-receptor autoantibodies (TRAb), is 
extremely rare. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the 
characteristics and evolution of GD during ICPi therapy. Five among 243 patients 
followed for ICPi-induced thyrotoxicosis showed TRAb positivity (2% of the 
cohort). GD occurred quickly after initiation of ICPis; its course was typical 
for two patients, with prolonged requirement for antithyroid drug treatment 
(ATD). The three other patients experienced biphasic thyroiditis with secondary 
hypothyroidism requiring long-term substitution. Three other patients had a 
diagnosis of GD before starting ICPis; they evolved toward hypothyroidism with 
early cessation of ATD and long-term substitution treatment during ICPi 
treatment. None developed significant Graves' orbitopathy. ICPi treatment was 
not interrupted for thyroid dysfunction. In conclusion, GD is a rare, 
immune-related adverse event of ICPis with an unusual course and frequent 
evolution to biphasic thyroiditis. In the case of ICPi-induced thyrotoxicosis in 
the presence of TRAb, observing the spontaneous evolution and performing a 
scintigraphy are useful before starting ATD treatment. Pre-existing GD is not 
exacerbated by ICPis and tends to evolve towards hypothyroidism. ICPi treatment 
can be maintained with adequate biochemical surveillance.
