HlyB functions as an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) 
transporter that enables bacteria to secrete toxins at the expense of ATP 
hydrolysis. Our previous work, based on potential energy profiles from combined 
quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations, has suggested 
that the highly conserved H-loop His residue H662 in the nucleotide binding 
domain (NBD) of E. coli HlyB may catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP through proton 
relay. To further test this hypothesis when entropic contributions are taken 
into account, we obtained QM/MM minimum free energy paths (MFEPs) for the HlyB 
reaction, making use of the string method in collective variables. The free 
energy profiles along the MFEPs confirm the direct participation of H662 in 
catalysis. The MFEP simulations of HlyB also reveal an intimate coupling between 
the chemical steps and a local protein conformational change involving the 
signature-loop residue S607, which may serve a catalytic role similar to an 
Arg-finger motif in many ATPases and GTPases in stabilizing the 
phosphoryl-transfer transition state.
