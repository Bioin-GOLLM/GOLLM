Alzheimer's disease (AD)-the most common type of dementia among the 
elderly-represents one of the most challenging and urgent medical mysteries 
affecting our aging population. Although dominant inherited mutation in genes 
involved in the amyloid metabolism can elicit familial AD, the overwhelming 
majority of AD cases, dubbed sporadic AD, do not display this Mendelian 
inheritance pattern. Apolipoprotein E (APOE), the main lipid carrier protein in 
the central nervous system, is the only gene that has been robustly and 
consistently associated with AD risk. The purpose of the current paper is thus 
to highlight the pleiotropic roles and the structure-function relationship of 
APOE to stimulate both the functional characterization and the identification of 
novel lipid homeostasis-related molecular targets involved in AD.
