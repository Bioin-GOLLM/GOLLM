With the development of effective systems for gene delivery to the central 
nervous system (CNS), gene therapy has become a therapeutic option for the 
treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gene therapies that are the most advanced 
in the clinic have been designed to more effectively compensate for the lack of 
dopamine signaling in the basal ganglia and rescue the cardinal motor symptoms 
of PD. However, it remains essential to devise novel therapies to prevent 
neurodegeneration and disease progression. Since gene therapy has been initially 
proposed for the delivery of neurotrophins to support the survival and function 
of dopaminergic neurons, our understanding of PD etiology has changed 
dramatically. Genes implicated in familial forms of the disease and genetic risk 
factors associated with sporadic PD have been identified. The spreading of the 
α-synuclein pathology, as well as perturbations of the lysosomal and 
mitochondrial activities, appear to play critical roles in the pathogenesis. 
These findings provide novel targets for gene therapy against PD, but at the 
same time underline the complexity of this chronic disease. Here we review and 
discuss the successes and limitations of gene therapy approaches, which have 
been proposed to provide neuroprotection in PD.
