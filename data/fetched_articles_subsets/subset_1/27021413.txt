BACKGROUND: Antisense oligonucleotides that induce exon skipping have been 
nominated as the most plausible treatment method for dystrophin expression in 
dystrophin-deficient Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Considering this therapeutic 
efficiency, small chemical compounds that can enable exon skipping have been 
highly awaited. In our previous report, a small chemical kinase inhibitor, 
TG003, was shown to enhance dystrophin expression by enhancing exon skipping.
PURPOSE: Staurosporine (STS), a small chemical broad kinase inhibitor, was 
examined for enhanced skipping of a nonsense-encoding dystrophin exon.
METHODS: STS was added to culture medium of HeLa cells transfected with 
minigenes expressing wild-type or mutated exon 31 with c.4303G>T (p.Glu1435X), 
and the resulting mRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR amplification. Dystrophin mRNA 
and protein were analyzed in muscle cells treated with STS by RT-PCR and western 
blotting, respectively.
RESULTS: STS did not alter splicing of the wild-type minigene. In the mutated 
minigene, STS increased the exon 31-skipped product. A combination of STS and 
TG003 did not significantly increase the exon 31-skipped product. STS enhanced 
skipping of exon 4 of the CDC-like kinase 1 gene, whereas TG003 suppressed it. 
Two STS analogs with selective kinase inhibitory activity did not enhance the 
mutated exon 31 skipping. When immortalized muscle cells with c.4303G>T in the 
dystrophin gene were treated with STS, skipping of the mutated exon 31 and 
dystrophin expression was enhanced.
CONCLUSIONS: STS, a broad kinase inhibitor, was shown to enhance skipping of the 
mutated exon 31 and dystrophin expression, but selective kinase inhibitors did 
not.
