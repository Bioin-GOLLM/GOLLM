Amino acid (AA) is a potent mitogen that controls growth and metabolism. Here we 
describe the identification of Rab1 as a conserved regulator of AA signaling to 
mTORC1. AA stimulates Rab1A GTP binding and interaction with mTORC1 and 
Rheb-mTORC1 interaction in the Golgi. Rab1A overexpression promotes mTORC1 
signaling and oncogenic growth in an AA- and mTORC1-dependent manner. 
Conversely, Rab1A knockdown selectively attenuates oncogenic growth of 
Rab1-overexpressing cancer cells. Moreover, Rab1A is overexpressed in colorectal 
cancer (CRC), which is correlated with elevated mTORC1 signaling, tumor 
invasion, progression, and poor prognosis. Our results demonstrate that Rab1 is 
an mTORC1 activator and an oncogene and that hyperactive AA signaling through 
Rab1A overexpression drives oncogenesis and renders cancer cells prone to 
mTORC1-targeted therapy.
