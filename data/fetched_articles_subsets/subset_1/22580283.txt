cGMP-dependent protein kinase-I (cGK-I) induces apoptosis in various cancer cell 
lines. However, the signaling mechanisms involved remain unknown. Using protein 
microarray technology, we identified a novel cGK substrate, death-associated 
protein kinase 2 (DAPK2), which is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-regulated 
serine/threonine kinase. cGK-I phosphorylated DAPK2 at Ser(299), Ser(367) and 
Ser(368). Interestingly, a phospho-mimic mutant, DAPK2 S299D, significantly 
enhanced its kinase activity in the absence of Ca(2+)/calmodulin, while a 
S367D/S368D mutant did not. Overexpression of DAPK2 S299D also resulted in a 
twofold increase in apoptosis of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells as compared 
with wild-type DAPK2. These results suggest that DAPK2 is one of the targets of 
cGK-I in apoptosis induction.
