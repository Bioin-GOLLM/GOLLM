The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay can be used to quantify 
micronucleus (MN) formation, the outcome measured being MN frequency. MN 
frequency has been shown to be both an accurate measure of chromosomal 
instability/DNA damage and a risk factor for cancer. Similarly, the Agilent 
4Ã—44k human oligonucleotide microarray can be used to quantify gene expression 
changes. Despite the existence of accepted methodologies to quantify both MN 
frequency and gene expression, very little is known about the association 
between the two. In modeling our count outcome (MN frequency) using gene 
expression levels from the high-throughput assay as our predictor variables, 
there are many more variables than observations. Hence, we extended the 
generalized monotone incremental forward stagewise method for predicting a count 
outcome for high-dimensional feature settings.
