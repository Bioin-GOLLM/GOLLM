BACKGROUND: Intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) results 
from breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and chromothripsis is a distinct marker of a 
subgroup of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases associated with a 
poor prognosis. iAMP21 accounts for 2% of pediatric B-ALL and occurs 
predominantly in older children or adolescents. ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, resulting 
from t(12;21)(p13;q22), is associated with an excellent outcome in younger 
children with B-ALL. Coexistence of iAMP21 with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion is extremely 
rare with limited clinical information available.
RESULTS: We report the case of an 18-year old Caucasian man diagnosed with 
ETV6-RUNX1 fusion positive B-ALL. He was treated with intensive chemotherapy and 
achieved remission for 6 months before relapse, 15 months after the initial 
diagnosis. G-band karyotyping and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analyses performed on bone marrow revealed complex abnormalities: 
41,X,-Y,der(3)t(3;20)(p11.2;q11.2),-4,t(5;22)(q32;q11.2),del(9)(p13),dic(9;17)(p13;p11.2),t(12;21)(p13;q22),der(14)t(14;17)(p11.2;q11.2),der(17;22)(q11.2;q11.2),-20,add(21)(q22),-22[4]/46,XY[15] 
with an iAMP21 and an ETV6-RUNX1. Additional molecular studies confirmed 
ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and with a TP53 mutation. High-resolution single nucleotide 
polymorphism microarray (SNP array) revealed the iAMP21 to be chromothripsis of 
21q and subsequent metaphase FISH further delineated complex genomic 
aberrations. Although the patient received intensive chemotherapy with allogenic 
stem cell transplant, he died 26 months after initial diagnosis. We searched the 
literature and identified six cases showing coexisting iAMP21 and ETV6-RUNX1. 
The median age for these six patients was 10 years (range, 2-18) and males 
predominated. The median overall survival (OS) was 28 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with B-ALL associated with both iAMP21 and ETV6-RUNX1 tend 
to be older children or adolescents and have a poor prognosis.
