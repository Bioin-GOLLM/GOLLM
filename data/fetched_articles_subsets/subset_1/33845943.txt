Gene drives for mosquito population replacement are promising tools for malaria 
control. However, there is currently no clear pathway for safely testing such 
tools in endemic countries. The lack of well-characterized promoters for 
infection-relevant tissues and regulatory hurdles are further obstacles for 
their design and use. Here we explore how minimal genetic modifications of 
endogenous mosquito genes can convert them directly into non-autonomous gene 
drives without disrupting their expression. We co-opted the native regulatory 
sequences of three midgut-specific loci of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae 
to host a prototypical antimalarial molecule and guide-RNAs encoded within 
artificial introns that support efficient gene drive. We assess the propensity 
of these modifications to interfere with the development of Plasmodium 
falciparum and their effect on fitness. Because of their inherent simplicity and 
passive mode of drive such traits could form part of an acceptable testing 
pathway of gene drives for malaria eradication.
