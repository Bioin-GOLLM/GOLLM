Recessive variants in GJB2 are the most important genetic cause of sensorineural 
hearing impairment (SNHI) worldwide. Phenotypes vary significantly in 
GJB2-related SNHI, even in patients with identical variants. For instance, 
patients homozygous for the GJB2 p.V37I variant, which is highly prevalent in 
the Asian populations, usually present with mild-to-moderate SNHI; yet 
severe-to-profound SNHI is occasionally observed in approximately 10% of p.V37I 
homozygotes. To investigate the genomic underpinnings of the phenotypic 
variability, we performed next-generation sequencing of GJB2 and other deafness 
genes in 63 p.V37I homozygotes with extreme phenotypic severities. Additional 
pathogenic variants of other deafness genes were identified in five of the 35 
patients with severe-to-profound SNHI. Furthermore, case-control association 
analyses were conducted for 30 unrelated p.V37I homozygotes with 
severe-to-profound SNHI against 28 p.V37I homozygotes with mild-to-moderate 
SNHI, and 120 population controls from the Taiwan Biobank. The 
severe-to-profound group exhibited a higher frequency of the crystallin lambda 1 
(CRYL1) variant (rs14236), located upstream of GJB2, than the mild-to-moderate 
and Taiwan Biobank groups. Our results demonstrated that pathogenic variants in 
other deafness genes and a possible modifier, the CRYL1 rs14236 variant, may 
contribute to phenotypic variability in GJB2-realted SNHI, highlighting the 
importance of comprehensive genomic surveys to delineate the genotype-phenotype 
correlations.
