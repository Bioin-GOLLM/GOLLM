BACKGROUND: Diabetes-associated cognition decline is one of central nervous 
system complications in diabetic mellitus, while its pathogenic mechanism 
remains unclear. In this study, (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance-based 
metabonomics and immunohistochemistry was used to explore key metabolic 
alterations in hippocampus of type 2 diabetic db/db mice with cognition decline 
in order to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of 
the disease.
RESULTS: Metabonomics reveals that lactate level was significantly increased in 
hippocampus of db/db mice with cognition decline compared with age-matched 
wild-type mice. Several tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates including 
succinate and citrate were reduced in hippocampus of db/db mice with cognition 
decline. Moreover, an increase in glutamine level and a decrease in glutamate 
and Î³-aminobutyric acid levels were observed in db/db mice. Results from 
immunohistochemistry analysis show that glutamine synthetase was increased and 
glutaminase and glutamate decarboxylase were decreased in db/db mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the development of diabetes-associated 
cognition decline in db/db mice is most likely implicated in a reduction in 
energy metabolism and a disturbance of glutamate-glutamine shuttling between 
neurons and astrocytes in hippocampus.
