Tubular apocrine adenoma is a rare benign adnexal neoplasm most commonly 
identified in the scalp, composed of a dermal proliferation of apocrine tubules 
in a background of hyalinized stroma. Tubular apocrine adenoma can be a 
component of various sweat gland tumors and can also morphologically overlap 
with other sweat gland neoplasms. Isolated tubular apocrine adenoma arising in 
the glands of Moll is exceedingly rare, with only 4 previously reported cases. 
We present a 63-year-old male with tubular apocrine adenoma of the left upper 
eyelid, which recurred following initial incomplete excision. Although the 
lesion showed focal morphologic similarity to the apocrine variant of 
pleomorphic adenoma (chondroid syringoma), the diagnosis of tubular apocrine 
adenoma was supported by fluorescence in situ hybridization studies, which 
demonstrated absence of PLAG1 and HMGA2 gene rearrangements seen in pleomorphic 
adenoma. This case illustrates the clinical, microscopic and immunohistochemical 
features of tubular apocrine adenoma. The recent advances in our understanding 
of the molecular genetics of tubular apocrine adenoma and related tumors, and 
how these advances shape the evolving classification of sweat gland tumors are 
reviewed.
