Gordon syndrome (GS), or distal arthrogryposis type 3, is a rare, 
autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by cleft palate and congenital 
contractures of the hands and feet. Exome sequencing of five GS-affected 
families identified mutations in piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel 
component 2 (PIEZO2) in each family. Sanger sequencing revealed PIEZO2 mutations 
in five of seven additional families studied (for a total of 10/12 [83%] 
individuals), and nine families had an identical c.8057G>A (p.Arg2686His) 
mutation. The phenotype of GS overlaps with distal arthrogryposis type 5 (DA5) 
and Marden-Walker syndrome (MWS). Using molecular inversion probes for targeted 
sequencing to screen PIEZO2, we found mutations in 24/29 (82%) DA5-affected 
families and one of two MWS-affected families. The presence of cleft palate was 
significantly associated with c.8057G>A (Fisher's exact test, adjusted p value < 
0.0001). Collectively, although GS, DA5, and MWS have traditionally been 
considered separate disorders, our findings indicate that they are etiologically 
related and perhaps represent variable expressivity of the same condition.
