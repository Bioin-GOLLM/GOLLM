As patients with solid (non-hematological) cancers and a life expectancy of <3 
months rarely benefit from oncological treatment, we examined whether the 
CT-determined loss of muscle mass is associated with an impaired 3-month overall 
survival (OS) in frail ≥75-year-old patients with cancer. Frailty was assessed 
with G8-screening and comprehensive geriatric assessment in older adults at risk 
of frailty. The L3-level skeletal (SMI) and psoas (PMI) muscle indexes were 
determined from routine CT scans. Established and optimized SMI and PMI cut-offs 
were used. In the non-curative treatment group (n = 58), 3-month OS rates for 
normal and low SMI were 95% and 64% (HR 9.28; 95% CI 1.2-71) and for PMI 88%, 
and 60%, respectively (HR 4.10; 1.3-13). A Cox multivariable 3-month OS model 
showed an HR of 10.7 (1.0-110) for low SMI, 2.34 (0.6-9.8) for ECOG performance 
status 3-4, 2.11 (0.5-8.6) for clinical frailty scale 5-9, and 0.57 (0.1-2.8) 
for males. The 24-month OS rates in the curative intent group (n = 21) were 91% 
and 38% for the normal and low SMI groups, respectively. In conclusion, 
CT-determined low muscle mass is independently associated with an impaired 
3-month OS and, alongside geriatric assessment, could aid in oncological versus 
best supportive care decision-making in frail patients with non-curable cancers.
