OBJECTIVES: Single nucleotide polymorphisms at nucleotides 46, 79 and 491 of the 
beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) gene modify its pharmacological properties 
and may alter the response to agonists. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the role played by beta2AR polymorphisms on isoproterenol-induced 
relaxation of internal mammary arteries ex vivo.
METHODS: Internal mammary leftover segments were collected from 96 patients 
undergoing coronary artery bypass operation. Vascular rings were allowed to 
reach equilibrium with physiological Krebs solution before precontraction with 
U46619. Using the organ bath technique, cumulative dose-response curve of 
isoproterenol was constructed and average EC50 calculated. beta2AR genotyping 
was performed using a PCR-RFLP analysis.
RESULTS: Arterial segments obtained from Gly16 homozygotes displayed reduced 
sensitivity to isoproterenol compared with carriers of Arg16 allele(s) [Mean 
(-log) EC50+/-SD, 6.42+/-0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.32-6.53 vs. 
6.67+/-0.25, 95% CI 6.62-6.73, P<0.001]. Among Gly16 homozygotes, the presence 
of two Glu27 alleles restored vascular response to the level noted among Arg16 
carriers (6.58+/-0.17, 95% CI 6.41-6.76). The least response to isoproterenol 
was noted in a single patient carrying the Gly16Gly-Gln27Glu-Thr164Ile combined 
genotype requiring almost six-fold higher isoproterenol concentration than 
carriers of the wild-type genotype to achieve half the maximal arterial 
dilatation (17.78 x 10(-7) vs. 3.01 x 10(-7) +/- 2.62 x 10(-7) mol/l).
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular dilatation by isoproterenol is determined by a complex 
interaction between polymorphisms at nucleotides 46, 79 and 491 of the beta2AR 
gene. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effect of additional 
polymorphisms in the coding and noncoding regions on vascular reactivity.
