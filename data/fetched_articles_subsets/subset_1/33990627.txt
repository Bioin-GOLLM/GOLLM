POU5F1-expressing cells can self-renew and differentiate, contributing to 
metastasis formation in colorectal cancer (CRC), but it plays an important role 
in normal pluripotent stem cells. Here, we identified the CRC-specific gene, 
HNF1A, which is the downstream of POU5F1. HNF1A associates with fatty acid and 
glucose metabolism, and CRC cells highly expressed it. In 198 CRC patients, high 
HNF1A expression was an independent predictor of disease-free (P = 0.031) and 
overall (P = 0.007) survival. HNF1A-knockdown showed significantly reduced cell 
growth, increased apoptosis, and improved anticancer drug sensitivity. We 
revealed that HNF1A regulated controlled GLUT1 expression via HIF1A and 
multidrug resistance protein function to suppress SRI. HNF1A expression was 
elevated in persister cells after exposure to anticancer drugs, and anticancer 
drug sensitivity was also improved in persister cells via the inhibition of 
HNF1A. In conclusion, HNF1A expression can reflect resistance to anticancer drug 
treatment, and its suppression improves anticancer drug sensitivity as a new 
therapeutic target.
