The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a versatile 
RNA-binding protein playing a critical role in alternative pre-mRNA splicing 
regulation in cancer. Emerging data have implicated hnRNP A1 as a central player 
in a splicing regulatory circuit involving its direct transcriptional control by 
c-Myc oncoprotein and the production of the constitutively active 
ligand-independent alternative splice variant of androgen receptor, AR-V7, which 
promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). As there is an urgent need 
for effective CRPC drugs, targeting hnRNP A1 could, therefore, serve a dual 
purpose of preventing AR-V7 generation as well as reducing c-Myc transcriptional 
output. Herein, we report compound VPC-80051 as the first small molecule 
inhibitor of hnRNP A1 splicing activity discovered to date by using a 
computer-aided drug discovery approach. The inhibitor was developed to target 
the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of hnRNP A1. Further experimental evaluation 
demonstrated that VPC-80051 interacts directly with hnRNP A1 RBD and reduces 
AR-V7 messenger levels in 22Rv1 CRPC cell line. This study lays the groundwork 
for future structure-based development of more potent and selective small 
molecule inhibitors of hnRNP A1‚ÅªRNA interactions aimed at altering the 
production of cancer-specific alternative splice isoforms.
