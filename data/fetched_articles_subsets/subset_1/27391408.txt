SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) selectively targets polyubiquitinated proteins for 
degradation via macroautophagy and the proteasome. Additionally, SQSTM1 shuttles 
between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, although its role in the 
nucleus is relatively unknown. Here, we report that SQSTM1 dynamically 
associates with DNA damage foci (DDF) and regulates DNA repair. Upon induction 
of DNA damage SQSTM1 interacts with FLNA (filamin A), which has previously been 
shown to recruit DNA repair protein RAD51 (RAD51 recombinase) to double-strand 
breaks and facilitate homologous recombination (HR). SQSTM1 promotes proteasomal 
degradation of FLNA and RAD51 within the nucleus, resulting in reduced levels of 
nuclear RAD51 and slower DNA repair. SQSTM1 regulates the ratio between HR and 
nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) by promoting the latter at the expense of the 
former. This SQSTM1-dependent mechanism mediates the effect of macroautophagy on 
DNA repair. Moreover, nuclear localization of SQSTM1 and its association with 
DDF increase with aging and are prevented by life-span-extending dietary 
restriction, suggesting that an imbalance in the mechanism identified here may 
contribute to aging and age-related diseases.
