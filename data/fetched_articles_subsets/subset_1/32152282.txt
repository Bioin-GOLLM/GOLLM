PRDM14 is a crucial regulator of mouse primordial germ cells (mPGCs), epigenetic 
reprogramming and pluripotency, but its role in the evolutionarily divergent 
regulatory network of human PGCs (hPGCs) remains unclear. Besides, a previous 
knockdown study indicated that PRDM14 might be dispensable for human germ cell 
fate. Here, we decided to use inducible degrons for a more rapid and 
comprehensive PRDM14 depletion. We show that PRDM14 loss results in 
significantly reduced specification efficiency and an aberrant transcriptome of 
hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) obtained in vitro from human embryonic stem cells 
(hESCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptomic analyses suggest that 
PRDM14 cooperates with TFAP2C and BLIMP1 to upregulate germ cell and 
pluripotency genes, while repressing WNT signalling and somatic markers. 
Notably, PRDM14 targets are not conserved between mouse and human, emphasising 
the divergent molecular mechanisms of PGC specification. The effectiveness of 
degrons for acute protein depletion is widely applicable in various 
developmental contexts.
