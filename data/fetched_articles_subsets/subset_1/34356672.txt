In the search for new therapeutic strategies to contrast SARS-CoV-2, we here 
studied the interaction of polydatin (PD) and resveratrol (RESV)-two natural 
stilbene polyphenols with manifold, well known biological activities-with Spike, 
the viral protein essential for virus entry into host cells, and ACE2, the 
angiotensin-converting enzyme present on the surface of multiple cell types 
(including respiratory epithelial cells) which is the main host receptor for 
Spike binding. Molecular Docking simulations evidenced that both compounds can 
bind Spike, ACE2 and the ACE2:Spike complex with good affinity, although the 
interaction of PD appears stronger than that of RESV on all the investigated 
targets. Preliminary biochemical assays revealed a significant inhibitory 
activity of the ACE2:Spike recognition with a dose-response effect only in the 
case of PD.
