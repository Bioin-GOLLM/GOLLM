The human mitochondrial genome is replicated by DNA polymerase γ, which is 
encoded by polymerase γ gene (POLG1) on chromosome 15q25. Patients with POLG1 
mutations usually present as Alpers' syndrome or progressive external 
ophthalmoplegia. Our patient was a 48-year old woman with sensory ataxic 
neuropathy, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and dysphagia. Sequence analysis 
revealed that she has two heterozygous missense mutations in the POLG1, a 
c.1774C>T substitution in exon 10, which results in a p.L591F amino acid change; 
and a c.3286C>T substitution in exon 21, which results in a p.R1096C amino acid 
change. The 1774C>T substitution is a novel mutation. Previously described adult 
patients with one mutation in exon 10 and the other in exon 21 of POLG1 had 
presented with progressive external ophthalmoplegia. We now describe a patient 
with mutations in the same exons but suffering from the more complex clinical 
syndrome of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia.
