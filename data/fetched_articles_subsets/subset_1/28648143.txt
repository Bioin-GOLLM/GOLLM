BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between polymorphism rs547984, 
located in close proximity to the Zona Pellucida Glycoprotein 4 (ZP4) gene on 
human chromosome 1q43 and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).
METHOD: Polymorphism rs547984 was genotyped using Taq-Man® assay in 185 subjects 
comprising of 90 unrelated POAG cases and 95 controls of Saudi origin.
RESULTS: Association analysis between cases and controls revealed no significant 
genotype distribution under additive (p = 0.356), dominant (p = 0.517) and 
recessive (p = 0.309) models. Besides, the allele frequency distribution was 
also found to be non-significant (p = 0.70). The minor "A" allele frequency was 
found to be 0.49 and 0.50 among POAG cases and controls, respectively. In 
addition, specific clinical indices used to assess severity of glaucoma such as 
intraocular pressure (IOP), cup/disc ratio and number of anti-glaucoma 
medication also did not show any significant genotype distribution in POAG 
cases.
CONCLUSION: Polymorphism rs547984 is neither associated with any clinical 
indices important for POAG such as IOP and cup/disc ratio nor is a risk factor 
for POAG in the Saudi cohort.
