BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is familial in approximately 20-35% of 
cases of idiopathic DCM. Several mutations in the different sarcomere protein 
genes have been reported to cause DCM.
AIMS: We wanted to investigate the role of sarcomere protein gene variants in 
Finnish DCM patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened all coding exons of five sarcomere protein 
genes (beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-tropomyosin, troponin C, troponin I and 
troponin T) in a well-characterized population of 52 DCM patients in Eastern 
Finland by the PCR-SSCP and sequencing method. Two novel mutations, Arg1053Gln 
and Arg1500Trp, in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene in two index patients were 
detected. The proband with the Arg1053Gln mutation had a dilated left ventricle 
and impaired systolic function, but other family members carrying this mutation 
presented with septal hypertrophy. It thus seems that the Arg1053Gln mutation is 
primarily a HCM mutation, which can also lead to DCM. The other mutation, 
Arg1500Trp, was associated with a typical DCM phenotype. The Arg1500Trp mutation 
carrier had only one family member alive, but she did not carry the mutation 
and, therefore, cosegregation of the mutation and the disease in this family 
could not be reliably verified. No disease-causing mutations were found in the 
other sarcomere protein genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Two novel mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene were 
detected in patients with DCM. Overall, mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain 
gene seem to be relatively uncommon in Finnish DCM patients.
