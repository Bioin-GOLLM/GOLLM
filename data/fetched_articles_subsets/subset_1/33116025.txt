To date, studies have demonstrated the potential functions of microRNAs in 
cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. Herein, we established a middle 
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats and then subjected them to 
reperfusion to explore the role of microRNA-374 (miR-374) in cerebral IR injury. 
After reperfusion, the endogenous miR-374 level decreased, and the expression of 
its target gene, Wnt5a, increased in brain tissues. Intracerebral pretreatment 
of miR-374 agomir attenuated cerebral damage induced by IR, including 
neurobehavioral deficits, infarction, cerebral edema and blood-brain barrier 
disruption. Moreover, rats pretreated with miR-374 agomir showed a remarkable 
decrease in apoptotic neurons, which was further confirmed by reduced BAX 
expression as well as increased BCL-2 and BCL-XL expression. A dual-luciferase 
reporter assay substantiated that Wnt5a was the target gene of miR-374. miR-374 
might protect against brain injury by downregulating Wnt5a in rats after IR. 
Thus, our study provided a novel mechanism of cerebral IR injury from the 
perspective of miRNA regulation.
