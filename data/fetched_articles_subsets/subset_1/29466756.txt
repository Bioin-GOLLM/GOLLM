T cell development is orchestrated by transcription factors that regulate the 
expression of genes initially buried within inaccessible chromatin, but the 
transcription factors that establish the regulatory landscape of the T cell 
lineage remain unknown. Profiling chromatin accessibility at eight stages of 
T cell development revealed the selective enrichment of TCF-1 at genomic regions 
that became accessible at the earliest stages of development. TCF-1 was further 
required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements and at the 
single-cell level, it dictated a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. 
TCF-1 expression in fibroblasts generated de novo chromatin accessibility even 
at chromatin regions with repressive marks, inducing the expression of 
T cell-restricted genes. These results indicate that a mechanism by which TCF-1 
controls T cell fate is through its widespread ability to target silent 
chromatin and establish the epigenetic identity of T cells.
