Androgens are essential to normal prostate growth and development. It is 
therefore possible that polymorphisms in the androgen synthesis gene 
5alpha-reductase type II (SRD5A2) may be involved in the progression of prostate 
tumors. We evaluated the relationship of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 
A49T and V89L, with prostate cancer risk in a case-control study. A total of 114 
prostate cancer patients and 144 healthy control males were genotyped. We found 
highly significant differences between the two polymorphisms, the risk of 
developing prostate cancer, and some of the clinical-pathologic characteristics. 
Individuals who carry at least one V allele may have a higher risk of developing 
prostate cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 7.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
2.57-22.08, P<0.001]. In addition, individuals with LL genotype showed reduction 
in the progression to a higher tumor stage (OR = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.040-0.27, 
P<0.001). The A49T substitution was associated with a higher pTNM stage (OR = 
2.87, 95%CI 1.14-7.21, P = 0.003) and elevated Gleason grade (OR = 3.14, 95%CI = 
1.12-8.78; P = 0.004). Furthermore, the allelic frequencies of the A49T variant 
(33% controls and 45% cases) are the highest reported worldwide. These findings 
suggest that among the Ecuadorian population, these polymorphisms influence the 
risk of developing prostate cancer.
