BACKGROUND: Analysis of viral protein-protein interactions is an essential step 
to uncover the viral protein functions and the molecular mechanism for the 
assembly of a viral protein complex. We employed a mammalian two-hybrid system 
to screen all the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for the protein-protein 
interactions.
RESULTS: Our study detected 48 interactions, 14 of which were firstly reported 
here. Unlike Nsp1 of SARS-CoV, Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 has the most interacting 
partners among all the viral proteins and likely functions as a hub for the 
viral proteins. Five self-interactions were confirmed, and five interactions, 
Nsp1/Nsp3.1, Nsp3.1/N, Nsp3.2/Nsp12, Nsp10/Nsp14, and Nsp10/Nsp16, were 
determined to be positive bidirectionally. Using the replicon reporter system of 
SARS-CoV-2, we screened all viral Nsps for their impacts on the viral 
replication and revealed Nsp3.1, the N-terminus of Nsp3, significantly inhibited 
the replicon reporter gene expression. We found Nsp3 interacted with N through 
its acidic region at N-terminus, while N interacted with Nsp3 through its NTD, 
which is rich in the basic amino acids. Furthermore, using purified truncated N 
and Nsp3 proteins, we determined the direct interactions between Nsp3 and N 
protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provided a basis for understanding the functions of 
coronavirus proteins and supported the potential of interactions as the target 
for antiviral drug development.
