Early-activated CD8+ T cells increase both aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). However, whether and how the augmentation of 
OXPHOS regulates differentiation of effector CD8+ T cell remains unclear. Here, 
we found that C1qbp was intrinsically required for such differentiation in 
antiviral and antitumor immune responses. Activated C1qbp-deficient CD8+ T cells 
failed to increase mitochondrial respiratory capacities, resulting in diminished 
acetylâ€“coenzyme A as well as elevated fumarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate. 
Consequently, hypoacetylation of H3K27 and hypermethylation of H3K27 and CpG 
sites were associated with transcriptional down-regulation of effector signature 
genes. The effector differentiation of C1qbp-sufficient or C1qbp-deficient CD8+ 
T cells was reversed by fumarate or a combination of histone deacetylase 
inhibitor and acetate. Therefore, these findings identify C1qbp as a pivotal 
positive regulator in the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells and highlight 
a metabolic-epigenetic axis in this process.
