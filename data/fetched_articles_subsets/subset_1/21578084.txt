In the title compound, [Rh(C(13)H(16)NO)(C(18)H(15)P)(CO)], the coordination 
geometry of the Rh(I) atom is square-planar, formed by the coordinating N and O 
atoms of the bidentate enaminoketonate ligand, one C atom from the carbonyl 
group and a P atom from triphenyl-phosphine. The complex displays a 
0.591 (3):0.409 (3) ratio disorder of the phenyl unit of the monoanionic 
N,O-bidentate ligand. Intra-molecular hydrogen bonding is observed between a C-H 
group of the triphenyl-phosphine unit and the O atom of the enamino-ketonate 
ligand.
