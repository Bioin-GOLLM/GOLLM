The influence of meal frequency and timing on health and disease has been a 
topic of interest for many years. While epidemiological evidence indicates an 
association between higher meal frequencies and lower disease risk, experimental 
trials have shown conflicting results. Furthermore, recent prospective research 
has demonstrated a significant increase in disease risk with a high meal 
frequency (≥6 meals/day) as compared to a low meal frequency (1⁻2 meals/day). 
Apart from meal frequency and timing we also have to consider breakfast 
consumption and the distribution of daily energy intake, caloric restriction, 
and night-time eating. A central role in this complex scenario is played by the 
fasting period length between two meals. The physiological underpinning of these 
interconnected variables may be through internal circadian clocks, and food 
consumption that is asynchronous with natural circadian rhythms may exert 
adverse health effects and increase disease risk. Additionally, alterations in 
meal frequency and meal timing have the potential to influence energy and 
macronutrient intake.A regular meal pattern including breakfast consumption, 
consuming a higher proportion of energy early in the day, reduced meal frequency 
(i.e., 2⁻3 meals/day), and regular fasting periods may provide physiological 
benefits such as reduced inflammation, improved circadian rhythmicity, increased 
autophagy and stress resistance, and modulation of the gut microbiota.
