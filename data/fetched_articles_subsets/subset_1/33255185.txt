The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is the essential regulator of genes 
involved both in xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. Diazepam has been shown 
as a potent stimulator of CAR nuclear translocation and is assumed as an 
indirect CAR activator not interacting with the CAR cavity. In this study, we 
sought to determine if diazepam is a ligand directly interacting with the CAR 
ligand binding domain (LBD) and if it regulates its target genes in a 
therapeutically relevant concentration. We used different CAR constructs in 
translocation and luciferase reporter assays, recombinant CAR-LBD in a TR-FRET 
assay, and target genes induction studied in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), 
HepaRG cells, and in CAR humanized mice. We also used in silico docking and 
CAR-LBD mutants to characterize the interaction of diazepam and its metabolites 
with the CAR cavity. Diazepam and its metabolites such as nordazepam, temazepam, 
and oxazepam are activators of CAR+Ala in translocation and two-hybrid assays 
and fit the CAR cavity in docking experiments. In gene reporter assays with CAR3 
and in the TR-FRET assay, only diazepam significantly interacts with CAR-LBD. 
Diazepam also promotes up-regulation of CYP2B6 in PHHs and in HepaRG cells. 
However, in humanized CAR mice, diazepam significantly induces neither CYP2B6 
nor Cyp2b10 genes nor does it regulate critical genes involved in glucose and 
lipids metabolism and liver proliferation. Thus, we demonstrate that diazepam 
interacts with human CAR-LBD as a weak ligand, but it does not significantly 
affect expression of tested CAR target genes in CAR humanized mice.
