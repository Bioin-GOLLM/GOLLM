Hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) is an important cancer-related medical 
emergency. It is a sign of advanced disease with a poor prognosis. We report a 
case of a 55-year-old man who presented with decreased sensorium, constipation 
for 4 days, dysphonia, and weight loss for the past three months. The physical 
examination showed a petrous nodular lesion of the neck in relation to the right 
sternocleidomastoid muscle. The digital rectal examination showed an enlarged 
prostate with a nodule of hard consistency. The blood revealed a hypercalcemia 
of 18.9 mg/dl and a prostate-specific antigen of 319.18 ng/ml. After further 
investigation, we discovered a squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx with 
multiple osteolytic bone lesions and a prostate adenocarcinoma. The 
hypercalcemia was treated with sodium pamidronate with good results. Such severe 
hypercalcemia demanded further research which revealed that not only the 
osteolytic lesions contributed to the elevation of calcium serum levels but also 
the tumor secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein. This case highlights 
the importance of not only having a high suspicion for malignancy in patients 
presenting with hypercalcemia but also being aware of possible additional 
diagnoses in a patient with an already identified primary pathology.
