Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was the first disease to be linked to 
the presence of a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. Nowadays over 95% of LHON 
cases are known to be caused by one of three primary mutations (m.11778G>A, 
m.14484T>C, and m.3460G>A). Reports for other (rare) primary mutations in LHON 
patients are not infrequent. Among those is the mutation m.3635G>A in the MT-ND1 
gene which was reported to be pathogenic in a Russian LHON family. In this 
study, we report on a Chinese family with clinical features of LHON but without 
any of the three well-known primary mutations. Analysis of the complete 
mitochondrial genome in the proband revealed the presence of m.3635G>A and 
m.6228C>T, along with a full array of other variants that suggest the haplogroup 
M7b1. Evolutionary analysis indicates that site 3635, but not 6228, is highly 
conserved in vertebrates. Protein secondary-structure modeling for the MT-ND1 
protein harboring amino acid change S110N indicates that mutant m.3635G>A 
decreases the protein hydrophobicity. Our current observations provide further 
support for a pathogenic role of m.3635G>A in patients with LHON.
