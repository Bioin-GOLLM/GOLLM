BACKGROUND: Despite the disease burden imposed by respiratory diseases on 
children in Central America, there is a paucity of data describing the etiologic 
agents of the disease.
AIMS: To analyze viral etiologic agents associated with influenza-like illness 
(ILI) in participants reporting to one outpatient health center, one pediatric 
hospital, and three general hospitals in El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua 
Material &
METHODS: Between August 2006 and April 2009, pharyngeal swabs were collected 
from outpatients and inpatients. Patient specimens were inoculated onto cultured 
cell monolayers, and viral antigens were detected by indirect and direct 
immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: A total of 1,756 patients were enrolled, of whom 1,195 (68.3%) were 
under the age of 5; and 183 (10.4%) required hospitalization. One or more viral 
agents were identified in 434 (24.7%) cases, of which 17 (3.9%) were dual 
infections. The most common viruses isolated were influenza A virus (130; 7.4% 
of cases), respiratory syncytial virus (122; 6.9%), adenoviruses (63; 3.6%), 
parainfluenza viruses (57; 3.2%), influenza B virus (47; 2.7% of cases), and 
herpes simplex virus 1 (22; 1.3%). In addition, human metapneumovirus and 
enteroviruses (coxsackie and echovirus) were isolated from patient specimens.
DISCUSSION: When compared to the rest of the population, viruses were isolated 
from a significantly higher percentage of patients age 5 or younger. The 
prevalence of influenza A virus or influenza B virus infections was similar 
between the younger and older age groups. RSV was the most commonly detected 
pathogen in infants age 5 and younger and was significantly associated with 
pneumonia (p < 0.0001) and hospitalization (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Genetic analysis of influenza isolates identified A (H3N2), A 
(H1N1), and B viruses. It also showed that the mutation H274Y conferring 
resistance to oseltamivir was first detected in Honduran influenza A/H1N1 
strains at the beginning of 2008. These data demonstrate that a diverse range of 
respiratory pathogens are associated with ILI in Honduras, El Salvador, and 
Nicaragua. RSV infection in particular appears to be associated with severe 
disease in infants in the region.
