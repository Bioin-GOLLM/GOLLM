We report a family with an extensive history of colon cancer consistent with 
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). A specific disease causing 
mutation was identified in affected individuals; p.W714X MLH1 mutation. Given 
the very young age of onset of cancer in some affected family members, with the 
youngest affected individual being 19 years of age, genetic counseling was 
recommended to children as young as 9 years. Ethical issues arose when affected 
families requested genetic testing for their underage children. Here we describe 
and debate the value of offering molecular testing for this adult onset disorder 
to several children in this particular family. We also examine possible 
molecular causes for the very young age of onset in some family members.
