RING finger protein 135 (RNF135, also named Riplet or REUL) exerts multiple 
biological functions and its C-terminal PRY-SPRY/B30.2 domain is indispensable 
for most of these functions. RNF135 interacts with RIG-I (retinoic 
acid-inducible gene-I) via the PRY-SPRY domain and ubiquitinates RIG-I to 
promote innate anti-viral signaling, while mutations in the RNF135 gene can 
cause the Macrocephaly, macrosomia, facial dysmorphism (MMFD) syndrome, and 
RNF135 reportedly regulates the proliferation of glioblastoma cells as well as 
tongue cancer cells. Nevertheless, structure of full-length RNF135 or its 
PRY-SPRY domain has not been determined, and structural basis for molecular 
interactions involving RNF135 is largely unknown. Here we report the backbone 
1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments of the PRY-SPRY domain of RNF135 and 
the secondary structure elements predicted based on chemical shifts, as well as 
the perturbations caused by the R286H mutation that is associated with MMFD 
syndrome. We found that the mutation did not alter the gross structure of the 
PRY-SPRY domain, so it may have impaired RNF135 function by affecting 
protein-protein interactions mediated by the domain.
