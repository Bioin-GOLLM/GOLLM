CONTEXT: Mutations that inactivate one allele of the gene encoding the calcium 
sensing receptor (CaSR) cause autosomal dominant familial hypocalciuric 
hypercalcemia (FHH), whereas homozygous mutations cause neonatal severe 
hyperparathyroidism.
OBJECTIVE: We describe the identification and biochemical characterization of a 
novel CASR gene mutation that caused apparent autosomal recessive FHH in an 
extended consanguineous kindred.
DESIGN: The study design involved direct sequence analysis of the CaSR gene, 
clinical and biochemical analyses of patients, and in vitro immunobiochemical 
studies of the mutant CaSR.
RESULTS: A novel inactivating mutation (Q459R) was identified in exon 4 of both 
alleles of the CASR in the proband, who presented with asymptomatic 
hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria at age 2 yr. The proband's parents were 
heterozygous for the Q459R mutation consistent with autosomal recessive 
inheritance of FHH. Among 13 family members that were studied, eight subjects 
were heterozygous for the Q459R mutation and five had normal genotypes. All 
heterozygous subjects were asymptomatic and normocalcemic apart from one subject 
who was mildly hypercalcemic. The Q459R mutant CaSR was normally expressed at 
the cell membrane but retained only 30-50% of the calcium-dependent activity of 
the wild-type CaSR.
CONCLUSION: We identified a novel loss-of-function Q459R mutation in the CASR 
gene that exhibits mildly reduced sensitivity to calcium and that is associated 
with apparent autosomal recessive transmission of FHH. This study demonstrates 
the importance of genetic testing in FHH to distinguish between de novo and 
inherited mutations of the CASR gene and assist in management decisions.
