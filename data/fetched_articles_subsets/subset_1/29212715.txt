Investigations into brain function and disease depend on the precise 
classification of neural cell types. Cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage differ 
greatly in their morphology, but accurate identification has thus far only been 
possible for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes in 
humans. We find that breast carcinoma amplified sequence 1 (BCAS1) expression 
identifies an oligodendroglial subpopulation in the mouse and human brain. These 
cells are newly formed, myelinating oligodendrocytes that segregate from 
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and mature oligodendrocytes and mark regions of 
active myelin formation in development and in the adult. We find that BCAS1+ 
oligodendrocytes are restricted to the fetal and early postnatal human white 
matter but remain in the cortical gray matter until old age. BCAS1+ 
oligodendrocytes are reformed after experimental demyelination and found in a 
proportion of chronic white matter lesions of patients with multiple sclerosis 
(MS) even in a subset of patients with advanced disease. Our work identifies a 
means to map ongoing myelin formation in health and disease and presents a 
potential cellular target for remyelination therapies in MS.
