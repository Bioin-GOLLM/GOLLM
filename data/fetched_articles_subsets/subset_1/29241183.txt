BACKGROUND/AIMS: Leptin is a hormone expressed by adipose tissue that regulates 
body energy homeostasis and weight loss by activating leptin receptors in the 
hypothalamus. Leptin receptors are also expressed in astrocytes. An 
anti-apoptosis effect of leptin in brain has recently been reported. However, 
the anti-apoptosis mechanism of leptin in the brain is unknown.
METHODS: To investigate whether leptin exerts protective effects against 
glutamate-induced apoptosis in astrocytes, we performed cell viability assays 
and apoptosis assays using rat primary astrocytes. Intracellular signaling 
pathways involved in anti-apoptosis effects of leptin were analyzed by 
immunoblotting together with a leptin mutant (S120A/T121A) with antagonist 
function and pharmacological inhibitors.
RESULTS: We found that glutamate-induced apoptosis in rat primary astrocytes was 
significantly decreased by treatment with leptin. Leptin inhibited 
glutamate-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in astrocytes. The leptin 
S120A/T121A mutant did not inhibit glutamate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and 
ERK1/2-mediated apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results provide initial evidence that leptin 
exerts an anti-apoptotic effect against glutamate toxicity through activation of 
intracellular signaling pathways which reverse glutamate-induced ERK1/2 
phosphorylation in primary astrocytes. Therefore, our findings suggest that 
leptin might be considered a candidate for potential therapeutic applications in 
glutamate-induced brain excitotoxicity.
