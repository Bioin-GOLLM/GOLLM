The tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is the most frequently 
mutated cancer gene in mesothelioma. Here we report novel functions for BAP1 in 
mitotic progression highlighting the relationship between BAP1 and control of 
genome stability in mesothelioma cells with therapeutic implications. Depletion 
of BAP1 protein induced proteasome-mediated degradation of BRCA1 in mesothelioma 
cells while loss of BAP1 correlated with BRCA1 loss in mesothelioma patient 
tumour samples. BAP1 loss also led to mitotic defects that phenocopied the loss 
of BRCA1 including spindle assembly checkpoint failure, centrosome amplification 
and chromosome segregation errors. However, loss of BAP1 also led to additional 
mitotic changes that were not observed upon BRCA1 loss, including an increase in 
spindle length and enhanced growth of astral microtubules. Intriguingly, these 
consequences could be explained by loss of expression of the KIF18A and KIF18B 
kinesin motors that occurred upon depletion of BAP1 but not BRCA1, as spindle 
and astral microtubule defects were rescued by re-expression of KIF18A and 
KIF18B, respectively. We therefore propose that BAP1 inactivation causes mitotic 
defects through BRCA1-dependent and independent mechanisms revealing novel 
routes by which mesothelioma cells lacking BAP1 may acquire genome instability 
and exhibit altered responses to microtubule-targeted agents.
