Cohesive FG domains assemble into a condensed phase forming the selective 
permeability barrier of nuclear pore complexes. Nanoscopic insight into 
fundamental cohesive interactions has long been hampered by the sequence 
heterogeneity of native FG domains. We overcome this challenge by utilizing an 
engineered perfectly repetitive sequence and a combination of solution and magic 
angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. We map the dynamics of cohesive interactions in 
both phase-separated and soluble states at atomic resolution using TROSY for 
rotational correlation time (TRACT) measurements. We find that FG repeats 
exhibit nanosecond-range rotational correlation times and remain disordered in 
both states, although FRAP measurements show slow translation of phase-separated 
FG domains. NOESY measurements enable the direct detection of contacts involved 
in cohesive interactions. Finally, increasing salt concentration and temperature 
enhance phase separation and decrease local mobility of FG repeats. This lower 
critical solution temperature (LCST) behaviour indicates that cohesive 
interactions are driven by entropy.
