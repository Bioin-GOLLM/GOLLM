Transmembrane β barrel proteins are folded into the outer membrane (OM) of 
Gram-negative bacteria by the β barrel assembly machinery (BAM) via a poorly 
understood process that occurs without known external energy sources. Here, we 
used single-particle cryo-EM to visualize the folding dynamics of a model β 
barrel protein (EspP) by BAM. We found that BAM binds the highly conserved "β 
signal" motif of EspP to correctly orient β strands in the OM during folding. We 
also found that the folding of EspP proceeds via "hybrid-barrel" intermediates 
in which membrane integrated β sheets are attached to the essential BAM subunit, 
BamA. The structures show an unprecedented deflection of the membrane 
surrounding the EspP intermediates and suggest that β sheets progressively fold 
toward BamA to form a β barrel. Along with in vivo experiments that tracked β 
barrel folding while the OM tension was modified, our results support a model in 
which BAM harnesses OM elasticity to accelerate β barrel folding.
