The molecular mechanisms regulating olfactory receptor (OR) expression in the 
mammalian nose are not yet understood. Here, we identify the transient 
expression of histone demethylase LSD1 and the OR-dependent expression of 
adenylyl cyclase 3 (Adcy3) as requirements for initiation and stabilization of 
OR expression. As a transcriptional coactivator, LSD1 is necessary for 
desilencing and initiating OR transcription, but as a transcriptional 
corepressor, it is incompatible with maintenance of OR expression, and its 
downregulation is imperative for stable OR choice. Adcy3, a sensor of OR 
expression and a transmitter of an OR-elicited feedback, mediates the 
downregulation of LSD1 and promotes the differentiation of olfactory sensory 
neurons (OSNs). This novel, three-node signaling cascade locks the epigenetic 
state of the chosen OR, stabilizes its singular expression, and prevents the 
transcriptional activation of additional OR alleles for the life of the neuron.
