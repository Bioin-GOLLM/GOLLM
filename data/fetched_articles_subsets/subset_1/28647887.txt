PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss current knowledge on the role of connexins and 
pannexins in the musculoskeletal system.
RECENT FINDINGS: Connexins and pannexins are crucial for the development and 
maintenance of both bone and skeletal muscle. In bone, the presence of connexin 
and more recently of pannexin channels in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and 
osteocytes has been described and shown to be essential for normal skeletal 
development and bone adaptation. In skeletal muscles, connexins and pannexins 
play important roles during development and regeneration through coordinated 
regulation of metabolic functions via cell-to-cell communication. Further, under 
pathological conditions, altered expression of these proteins can promote muscle 
atrophy and degeneration by stimulating inflammasome activity. In this review, 
we highlight the important roles of connexins and pannexins in the development, 
maintenance, and regeneration of musculoskeletal tissues, with emphasis on the 
mechanisms by which these molecules mediate chemical (e.g., ATP and 
prostaglandin E2) and physical (e.g., mechanical stimulation) stimuli that 
target the musculoskeletal system and their involvement in the 
pathophysiological changes in both genetic and acquired diseases.
