OBJECTIVES: There are very few data available in the literature on the use of 
stiripentol in adults with Dravet syndrome (DS). DS cases are increasingly 
recognized in adulthood, and more children with DS now survive to adulthood. The 
aim of the study was to document the effectiveness and tolerability of 
stiripentol in adults with DS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted an observational clinical audit in the 
epilepsy service of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London 
(UK).
RESULTS: We included 13 adult subjects with DS (eight females, five males). The 
responder (defined as more than 50% reduction in all seizure types) rate was 
3/13 (23%) at 36 months. The following other outcomes were reported: seizure 
exacerbation (3/13, 23%), no change (3/13, 23%), less than 50% reduction in 
seizures (2/13, 15%), more than 50% reduction in generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures but no other seizure types (1/13, 8%), undefined response (1/13, 8%). 
The retention rate was 62% after 1 year and 31% after 5 years. Adverse effects 
were reported in 7/13 (54%): the most frequent were anorexia, weight loss, 
unsteadiness and tiredness. Withdrawal due to adverse effects occurred in 3/13 
(23%).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous studies on children with DS, our results 
show a lower responder rate and a similar tolerability profile. Stiripentol can 
be effective with a good tolerability profile. Our audit is small, but supports 
the use of stiripentol in adults with DS when first-line treatments are 
ineffective or not tolerated, in keeping with published guidelines.
