BACKGROUND: Measles virus attenuation has been historically performed by 
adaptation to cell culture. The current dogma is that attenuated virus strains 
induce more type I IFN and are more resistant to IFN-induced protection than 
wild type (wt).
RESULTS: The adaptation of a measles virus isolate (G954-PBL) by 13 passages in 
Vero cells induced a strong attenuation of this strain in vivo. The adapted 
virus (G954-V13) differs from its parental strain by only 5 amino acids (4 in 
P/V/C and 1 in the M gene). While a vaccine strain, Edmonston Zagreb, could 
replicate equally well in various primate cells, both G954 strains exhibited 
restriction to the specific cell type used initially for their propagation. 
Surprisingly, we observed that both G954 strains induced type I IFN, the wt 
strain inducing even more than the attenuated ones, particularly in human 
plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells. Type I IFN-induced protection from the infection 
of both G954 strains depended on the cell type analyzed, being less efficient in 
the cells used to grow the viral strain.
CONCLUSION: Thus, mutations in M and P/V/C proteins can critically affect MV 
pathogenicity, cellular tropism and lead to virus attenuation without 
interfering with the alpha/beta IFN system.
