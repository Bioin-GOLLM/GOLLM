Opioid analgesics are powerful pain relievers; however, over time, pain control 
diminishes as analgesic tolerance develops. The molecular mechanisms initiating 
tolerance have remained unresolved to date. We have previously shown that 
desensitization of the μ-opioid receptor and interaction with β-arrestins is 
controlled by carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation. Here we created knockin mice 
with a series of serine- and threonine-to-alanine mutations that render the 
receptor increasingly unable to recruit β-arrestins. Desensitization is 
inhibited in locus coeruleus neurons of mutant mice. Opioid-induced analgesia is 
strongly enhanced and analgesic tolerance is greatly diminished. Surprisingly, 
respiratory depression, constipation, and opioid withdrawal signs are unchanged 
or exacerbated, indicating that β-arrestin recruitment does not contribute to 
the severity of opioid side effects and, hence, predicting that G-protein-biased 
µ-agonists are still likely to elicit severe adverse effects. In conclusion, our 
findings identify carboxyl-terminal multisite phosphorylation as key step that 
drives acute μ-opioid receptor desensitization and long-term tolerance.
