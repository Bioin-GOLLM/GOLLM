AIM: To investigate the association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 
the phospholipase A2 group IVC (PLA2G4C) and phospholipase A2 group XIIA 
(PLA2G12A) polymorphisms in the Northeast Han Chinese population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 68 family trios (children diagnosed with ASD 
and their unaffected parents) were enrolled. Five single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs9226, rs1045376, rs251684, rs2307279, and rs156631) in 
PLA2G4C and four SNPs (rs6533451, rs2285714, rs2285713, and rs11728699) in 
PLA2G12A were selected and genotyped. The association between the SNPs and ASD 
was analyzed using the transmission disequilibrium test.
RESULTS: Our results showed a significant association between ASD and the 
rs251684 variant of PLA2G4C (transmitted/nontransmitted = 36/21, χ2 = 3.947, 
p = 0.047), but no association between ASD and the other eight SNPs investigated 
(all p > 0.05). Moreover, we found no preference in the transmission of 
haplotypes constructed for either PLA2G4C or PLA2G12A.
CONCLUSION: The rs251684 polymorphism of PLA2G4C may be associated with ASD 
risk.
