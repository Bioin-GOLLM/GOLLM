Ocular inflammation is a common complication of various eye diseases with wide 
consequences from irritations to potentially sight-threatening complications. 
Green tea is a popular beverage throughout the world. One of the proven health 
benefits of consuming green tea extract (GTE) is anti-inflammation. Catechins 
are the biologically active constituents of GTE. In in vitro and in vivo 
studies, GTE and catechins present inhibition of inflammatory responses in the 
development of ocular inflammation including infectious, non-infectious or 
autoimmune, and oxidative-induced complications. Research on the ocular 
inflammation in animal models has made significant progress in the past decades 
and several key disease mechanisms have been identified. Here we review the 
experimental investigations on the effects of GTE and catechins on various 
ocular inflammation related diseases including glaucoma, age-related macular 
degeneration, uveitis and ocular surface inflammation. We also review the 
pharmacokinetics of GTE constituents and safety of green tea consumption. We 
discuss the insights and perspectives of these experimental results, which would 
be useful for future development of novel therapeutics in human.
