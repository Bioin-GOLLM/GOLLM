BACKGROUND & AIMS: Vitamin C is an antioxidant with a potential role in the 
prevention of digestive system cancers, but there is yet no consensus whether 
vitamin C has a causal role in these cancers. The aim of this study was to 
utilize Mendelian randomization to decipher the potential causal associations of 
vitamin C with risk of digestive system cancers.
METHODS: Ten genetic variants previously found to be significantly associated 
with circulating vitamin C were used as instrumental variables. Effect size 
estimates for the genetic associations of the vitamin C-associated genetic 
variants with six major malignancies of digestive system were obtained from the 
FinnGen (N = 309 154) and UK Biobank (N = 367 542) studies. Results from the two 
studies were combined using meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Genetically predicted higher circulating vitamin C showed a suggestive 
association with lower risk of small intestine and colorectal cancer after 
accounting for multiple testing. The odds ratio per 1 standard deviation 
increment in circulating vitamin C was 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.32-0.94; 
P = 0.029) for small intestine cancer and 0.84 (95% confidence interval 
0.73-0.96; P = 0.013) for colorectal cancer. There was a suggestive association 
between genetically predicted higher circulating vitamin C with lower risk of 
liver cancer in FinnGen but no association in the meta-analysis (odds ratio 
0.69; 95% CI 0.36-1.32; P = 0.265). Genetically predicted circulating vitamin C 
was not associated with cancers of the esophagus, stomach, or pancreas.
CONCLUSION: This Mendelian randomization study indicates that vitamin C might 
play a role in the prevention of small intestine and colorectal cancer.
