OBJECTIVE: The role of the amygdala in emotion recognition is well established, 
and amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance have each been shown 
separately to be highly heritable traits, but the potential role of common 
genetic influences on both traits has not been explored. The authors 
investigated the pleiotropic influences of amygdala volume and emotion 
recognition performance.
METHOD: In a sample of randomly selected extended pedigrees (N=858), the authors 
used a combination of univariate and bivariate linkage to investigate pleiotropy 
between amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance and followed up with 
association analysis.
RESULTS: The authors found a pleiotropic region for amygdala volume and emotion 
recognition performance on chromosome 4q26 (LOD score=4.40). Association 
analysis conducted in the region underlying the bivariate linkage peak revealed 
a variant meeting the corrected significance level (Bonferroni-corrected 
p=5.01×10(-5)) within an intron of PDE5A (rs2622497, p=4.4×10(-5)) as being 
jointly influential on both traits. PDE5A has been implicated previously in 
recognition-memory deficits and is expressed in subcortical structures that are 
thought to underlie memory ability, including the amygdala.
CONCLUSIONS: This study extends our understanding of the shared etiology between 
the amygdala and emotion recognition by showing that the overlap between 
amygdala volume and emotion recognition performance is due at least in part to 
common genetic influences. Moreover, this study identifies a pleiotropic locus 
for the two traits and an associated variant, which localizes the genetic signal 
even more precisely. These results, when taken in the context of previous 
research, highlight the potential utility of PDE5 inhibitors for ameliorating 
emotion recognition deficits in individuals suffering from mental or 
neurodegenerative illness.
