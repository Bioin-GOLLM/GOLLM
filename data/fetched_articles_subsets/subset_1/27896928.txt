Liddle syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant monogenic form of hypertension. The 
authors analyzed clinical and genetic features of 12 cases of Liddle syndrome, 
the largest sample size ever reported. Clinical data were studied 
retrospectively. The exon 13 of the β and γ subunits of the epithelial sodium 
channel were amplified and sequenced in the peripheral blood leukocytes of the 
patients. The onset age of the 12 patients was 15.5±3.3 years. Their blood 
pressures were poorly controlled, and serum potassium levels in most patients 
were <3.0 mmol/L. Upright plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone 
concentration were suppressed in all patients. All patients were treated with 
triamterene, and blood pressures were well controlled and serum potassium levels 
returned to normal. The serum creatinine level rose to 124 and 161 μmol/L, 
respectively, in two patients upon triamterene treatment, and returned to normal 
soon after treatment was discontinued. Eight mutation alleles were identified, 
and three mutations were newly identified.
