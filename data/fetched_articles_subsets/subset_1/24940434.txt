Preeclampsia (PE) is considered to be a potentially fatal complication during 
pregnancy. However, no effective laboratory assessment has been developed to 
enable early diagnosis and monitoring of PE. The present study aimed to identify 
differentially expressed transthyretin (TTR) during severe PE and evaluate TTR 
as a possible biomarker of this disease. TTR levels were determined in the 
different gestational weeks of normal pregnancy (before 20 weeks, n=41; after 20 
weeks, n=39) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TTR concentrations 
in pregnant females with severe PE (n=43) were compared with those in healthy 
matched control subjects (n=37) using western blot analysis and ELISA. The 
median TTR concentration during severe PE in each month of gestation was 
significantly lower than the concentrations recorded during normal pregnancy. 
TTR levels in females with severe PE were significantly downregulated compared 
with the control subjects (P<0.001; area under the curve, 0.834-0.967). Thus, 
TTR may be used as a potential biomarker of PE.
