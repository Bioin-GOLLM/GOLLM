Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited human 
disorders, with an estimated incidence of 1 per 3500 births. In most cases, the 
disease is caused either by mutation in the NF1 gene, or by a particular or 
complete deletion of the NF1 gene. The NF1 gene exhibits one of the highest 
mutation rates of any human disorder. In this experimental study of the NF1 
gene, we screened the mutational spectrum of 22 unrelated patients from the 
Czech Republic using the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography 
(DHPLC) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) methods. We 
found NF1 mutations in 17 patients: 15 causal mutations were detected with the 
use of the DHPLC method (15/20, 75%). With the MPLA method, we also confirmed 
and specified two large deletions that were previously genotyped by 
microsatellite markers. Twelve of the above-mentioned mutations were newly 
found: c.1_2delATinsCC, c.1185+1G>C, c.1757_1760delCTAG, c.1642-7A>G, c.2329 
T>G, c.2816delA, c.3738_3741delGTTT, c.4733 C>T, c.5220delT, c.6473_6474insGAAG, 
ex14_49del, ex28_49del. We present this study as a first effectual step in the 
routine diagnosis of the NF1 in patients from the Czech Republic.
