In recent years, in-depth studies have shown that extracellular matrix stiffness 
plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, migration, immunity, 
malignant transformation, and apoptosis. Most of these processes entail 
metabolic reprogramming of cells. However, the exact mechanism through which 
extracellular matrix stiffness leads to metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. 
Insights regarding the relationship between extracellular matrix stiffness and 
metabolism could help unravel novel therapeutic targets and guide development of 
clinical approaches against a myriad of diseases. This review provides an 
overview of different pathways of extracellular matrix stiffness involved in 
regulating glucose, lipid and amino acid metabolism.
