The intracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers critically 
contributes to disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be the 
potential target of AD therapy. Direct observation of molecular dynamics of Aβ 
oligomers in vivo is key for drug discovery research, however, it has been 
challenging because Aβ aggregation inhibits the fluorescence from fusion 
proteins. Here, we developed Aβ1-42-GFP fusion proteins that are oligomerized 
and visualize their dynamics inside cells even when aggregated. We examined the 
aggregation states of Aβ-GFP fusion proteins using several methods and confirmed 
that they did not assemble into fibrils, but instead formed oligomers in vitro 
and in live cells. By arranging the length of the liker between Aβ and GFP, we 
generated two fusion proteins with "a long-linker" and "a short-linker", and 
revealed that the aggregation property of fusion proteins can be evaluated by 
measuring fluorescence intensities using rat primary culture neurons transfected 
with Aβ-GFP plasmids and Aβ-GFP transgenic C. elegans. We found that Aβ-GFP 
fusion proteins induced cell death in COS7 cells. These results suggested that 
novel Aβ-GFP fusion proteins could be utilized for studying the physiological 
functions of Aβ oligomers in living cells and animals, and for drug screening by 
analyzing Aβ toxicity.
