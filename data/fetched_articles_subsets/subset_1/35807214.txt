Superphane, i.e., [2.2.2.2.2.2](1,2,3,4,5,6)cyclophane, is a very convenient 
molecule in studying the nature of guest⋯host interactions in endohedral 
complexes. Nevertheless, the presence of as many as six ethylene bridges in the 
superphane molecule makes it practically impossible for the trapped entity to 
escape out of the superphane cage. Thus, in this article, I have implemented the 
idea of using the superphane derivatives with a reduced number of ethylene 
linkers, which leads to the [2n] cyclophanes where n<6. Seven such cyclophanes 
are then allowed to form endohedral complexes with noble gas (Ng) atoms (He, Ne, 
Ar, Kr). It is shown that in the vast majority of cases, the initially trapped 
Ng atom spontaneously escapes from the cyclophane cage, creating an exohedral 
complex. This is the best proof that the Ng⋯cyclophane interaction in endohedral 
complexes is indeed highly repulsive, i.e., destabilizing. Apart from the 
‘sealed’ superphane molecule, endohedral complexes are only formed in the case 
of the smallest He atom. However, it has been shown that in these cases, the 
Ng⋯cyclophane interaction inside the cyclophane cage is nonbonding, i.e., 
repulsive. This highly energetically unfavorable effect causes the cyclophane 
molecule to ‘swell’.
