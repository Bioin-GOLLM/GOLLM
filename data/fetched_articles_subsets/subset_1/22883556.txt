The polyol dehydrogenase PDH-11300 from Deinococcus geothermalis was cloned, 
functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized. The 
enzyme showed the highest activity in the oxidation of xylitol and 
1,2-hexanediol and had an optimum temperature of 45 °C. The enzyme exhibited a 
T⁶⁰₅₀-value of 48.3 °C. The T⁶⁰₅₀ is the temperature where 50% of the initial 
activity remains after incubation for 1h. In order to elucidate the structural 
reasons contributing to thermostability, the substrate-binding loop of PDH-11300 
was substituted by the loop-region of a homolog enzyme, the galactitol 
dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (PDH-158), resulting in a chimeric 
enzyme (PDH-loop). The substrate scope of this chimera basically represented the 
average of both wild-type enzymes, but surprisingly the T⁶⁰₅₀ was noticeably 
increased by 7 °C up to 55.3 °C. Further mutations in the active site led to 
identification of residues crucial for enzyme activity. The cofactor specificity 
was successfully altered from NADH to NADPH by an Asp55Asn mutation, which is 
located at the NAD⁺ binding cleft, without influencing the catalytic properties 
of the dehydrogenase.
