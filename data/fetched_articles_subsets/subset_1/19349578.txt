SRY and other Sox-type transcription factors are important developmental 
regulators with various implications in human disease. In this study, we 
identified Exp4 (exportin 4) as an interaction partner of Sox2 in mouse 
embryonic stem cells and neural progenitors. We show that, besides its 
established function in nuclear export, Exp4 acts as a bona fide nuclear import 
receptor for Sox2 and SRY. Thus, Exp4 is an example of a nuclear transport 
receptor carrying distinct cargoes into different directions. In contrast to a 
published study, we observed that the import activity of Imp-alpha (importin-a) 
isoforms toward Sox2 is negligible. Instead, we found that Imp9 and the 
Imp-beta/7 heterodimer mediate nuclear import of Sox2 in parallel to Exp4. 
Import signals for the three pathways overlap and include conserved residues in 
the Sox2 high-mobility group (HMG) box domain that are also critical for DNA 
binding. This suggests that nuclear import of Sox proteins is facilitated by 
several parallel import pathways.
