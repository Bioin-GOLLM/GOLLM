Selenoproteins are a unique class of proteins that contain the 21st amino acid, 
selenocysteine (Sec). Addition of Sec into a protein is achieved by recoding of 
the UGA stop codon. All 25 mammalian selenoprotein mRNAs possess a 3' UTR 
stem-loop structure, the Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS), which is 
required for Sec incorporation. It is widely believed that the SECIS is the 
major RNA element that controls Sec insertion, however recent findings in our 
lab suggest otherwise for Selenoprotein S (SelS). Here we report that the first 
91 nucleotides of the SelS 3' UTR contain a proximal stem loop (PSL) and a 
conserved sequence we have named the SelS Positive UGA Recoding (SPUR) element. 
We developed a SelS-V5/UGA surrogate assay for UGA recoding, which was validated 
by mass spectrometry to be an accurate measure of Sec incorporation in cells. 
Using this assay, we show that point mutations in the SPUR element greatly 
reduce recoding in the reporter; thus, the SPUR is required for readthrough of 
the UGA-Sec codon. In contrast, deletion of the PSL increased Sec incorporation. 
This effect was reversed when the PSL was replaced with other stem-loops or an 
unstructured sequence, suggesting that the PSL does not play an active role in 
Sec insertion. Additional studies revealed that the position of the SPUR 
relative to the UGA-Sec codon is important for optimal UGA recoding. Our 
identification of the SPUR element in the SelS 3' UTR reveals a more complex 
regulation of Sec incorporation than previously realized.
