Recently, covalent modifications of RNA, such as methylation, have emerged as 
key regulators of all aspects of RNA biology and have been implicated in 
numerous diseases, for instance, cancer. Here, we undertook a combination of in 
vitro and in vivo screens to test 78 potential methyltransferases for their 
roles in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell proliferation. We identified 
methyltransferase-like protein 6 (METTL6) as a crucial regulator of tumor cell 
growth. We show that METTL6 is a bona fide transfer RNA (tRNA) 
methyltransferase, catalyzing the formation of 3-methylcytidine at C32 of 
specific serine tRNA isoacceptors. Deletion of Mettl6 in mouse stem cells 
results in changes in ribosome occupancy and RNA levels, as well as impaired 
pluripotency. In mice, Mettl6 knockout results in reduced energy expenditure. We 
reveal a previously unknown pathway in the maintenance of translation efficiency 
with a role in maintaining stem cell self-renewal, as well as impacting tumor 
cell growth profoundly.
