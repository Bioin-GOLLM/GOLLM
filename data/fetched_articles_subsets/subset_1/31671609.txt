Cancer cells modulate their metabolism to proliferate and survive under the 
metabolic stress condition, which is known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. 
Therefore, cancer cells should suppress ER stress-mediated cell death and induce 
autophagy-which recycles metabolites to provide energy and new macromolecules. 
In this study, we demonstrate that the ER membrane protein BAP31 acts to 
suppress adaptation to ER stress conditions, induce cell death, and suppress 
autophagy by forming a BAP31-STX17 protein complex. The loss of BAP31 stimulates 
tumor growth in metabolic stress conditions in vivo and enhances invasion 
activity. Therefore, BAP31 stimulates cell death and inhibits autophagy, and it 
can be considered a novel tumor suppressor factor that acts by preventing ER 
stress adaptation.
