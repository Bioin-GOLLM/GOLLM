Variation in levels of the human metabolome reflect changes in homeostasis, 
providing a window into health and disease. The genetic impact on circulating 
metabolites in Hispanics, a population with high cardiometabolic disease burden, 
is largely unknown. We conducted genome-wide association analyses on 640 
circulating metabolites in 3,926 Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of 
Latinos participants. The estimated heritability for 640 metabolites ranged 
between 0%-54% with a median at 2.5%. We discovered 46 variant-metabolite pairs 
(p value < 1.2 × 10-10, minor allele frequency ≥ 1%, proportion of variance 
explained [PEV] mean = 3.4%, PEVrange = 1%-22%) with generalized effects in two 
population-based studies and confirmed 301 known locus-metabolite associations. 
Half of the identified variants with generalized effect were located in genes, 
including five nonsynonymous variants. We identified co-localization with the 
expression quantitative trait loci at 105 discovered and 151 known 
loci-metabolites sets. rs5855544, upstream of SLC51A, was associated with higher 
levels of three steroid sulfates and co-localized with expression levels of 
SLC51A in several tissues. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis identified 
several metabolites associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 
diabetes. For example, two variants located in or near CYP4F2 (rs2108622 and 
rs79400241, respectively), involved in vitamin E metabolism, were associated 
with the levels of octadecanedioate and vitamin E metabolites (gamma-CEHC and 
gamma-CEHC glucuronide); MR analysis showed that genetically high levels of 
these metabolites were associated with lower odds of CHD. Our findings document 
the genetic architecture of circulating metabolites in an underrepresented 
Hispanic/Latino community, shedding light on disease etiology.
