The present study involves synthesis a new series of α-aminophosphonates 2a-f 
and 4a-d derivatives in good yield with a simple workup via Kabachnik-Fields 
reaction in the presence of lithium perchlorate as Lewis acid catalyst. All the 
newly synthesized compounds were confirmed using various physical, 
spectroscopic, and analytical data. The in vitro anticancer activities of each 
compound were evaluated against colorectal carcinoma Colon cancer (HCT-116) and 
Epdermoid carcinoma (HEP2) and also Human lung fibroblast normal cell line 
(WI38) compared with Doxorubicin. The results showed that Compounds 2a, 4b and 
4d exhibited more potent inhibitory activity for Epdermoid Carcinoma (HEP2) 
compared with doxorubicin. For colon carcinoma cells (HCT-116) Compounds 2a, 2d 
and 4b gave the strongest activity among all compounds compared with 
doxorubicin. Moreover, all designed structures were docked into the active site 
of VEGFR2 and FGFR1 proteins. The result reveals that compound 2b and have the 
strongest inhibitory activity of the VEGFR2 and FGFR1 proteins indicating that 
these substances might conceivably operate as VEGFR2 and FGFR1 inhibitors and 
hence might take role in anticancer activities with various binding 
interactions. The 3D-QSAR models produced strong statistical results since they 
were defined by PLS factors 4 and confirmed by parameters as R2, R2 CV, 
Stability, F-value, P-value, RMSE, Q2, and Pearson-r.
