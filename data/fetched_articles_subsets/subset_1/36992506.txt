Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne gastroenteritis, affecting 
millions of people worldwide annually. Among the ten genotypes (GI-GX) of 
norovirus, only GI, GII, GIV, GVIII, and GIX infect humans. Some genotypes 
reportedly exhibit post-translational modifications (PTMs), including N- and 
O-glycosylation, O-GlcNAcylation, and phosphorylation, in their viral antigens. 
PTMs have been linked to increased viral genome replication, viral particle 
release, and virulence. Owing to breakthroughs in mass spectrometry (MS) 
technologies, more PTMs have been discovered in recent years and have 
contributed significantly to preventing and treating infectious diseases. 
However, the mechanisms by which PTMs act on noroviruses remain poorly 
understood. In this section, we outline the current knowledge of the three 
common types of PTM and investigate their impact on norovirus pathogenesis. 
Moreover, we summarize the strategies and techniques for the identification of 
PTMs.
