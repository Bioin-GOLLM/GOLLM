Pathogens commonly utilize endocytic pathways to gain cellular access. The 
endosomal pattern recognition receptors TLR7 and TLR9 detect pathogen-encoded 
nucleic acids to initiate MyD88-dependent proinflammatory responses to microbial 
infection. Using genome-wide RNAi screening and integrative systems-based 
analysis, we identify 190 cofactors required for TLR7- and TLR9-directed 
signaling responses. A set of cofactors were crossprofiled for their activities 
downstream of several immunoreceptors and then functionally mapped based on the 
known architecture of NF-κB signaling pathways. Protein complexes and pathways 
involved in ubiquitin-protein ligase activities, sphingolipid metabolism, 
chromatin modifications, and ancient stress responses were found to modulate 
innate recognition of endosomal nucleic acids. Additionally, hepatocyte growth 
factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) was characterized as necessary 
for ubiquitin-dependent TLR9 targeting to the endolysosome. Proteins and 
pathways identified here should prove useful in delineating strategies to 
manipulate innate responses for treatment of autoimmune disorders and microbial 
infection.
