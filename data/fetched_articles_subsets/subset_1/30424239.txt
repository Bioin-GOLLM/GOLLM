Exosomes have gained immense importance since their proteomic and genetic 
contents could potentially be used for disease diagnostics, monitoring of cancer 
progression, metastasis, and drug efficacy. However, establishing the clinical 
utility of exosomes has been restricted due to small sizes and high sample loss 
from extensive sample preparation. Sample loss is particularly critical for body 
fluids limited in volume and difficult to access, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid. We 
present a microfluidic technique that locally enhances the concentration of 
extracellular vesicles extracted from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines 
by using an ion concentration polarization (ICP)-based electrokinetic 
concentrator. Our design incorporates a trapping mechanism near the conductive 
polymer membrane; therefore, we can preconcentrate and capture extracellular 
vesicles simultaneously. Compared with standard fluorescence detection, our 
method increased the limit of detection (LOD) of extracellular vesicles by two 
orders of magnitude in 30 min. Our concentrator increased the extracellular 
vesicle concentration for 5.0 × 10⁷ particles/1 mL (LOD), 5.0 × 10⁸ particles/1 
mL, and 5.0 × 10⁸ particles/1 mL by ~100-fold each within 30 min using 45 V. 
This study demonstrates an alternative platform to simultaneously preconcentrate 
and capture extracellular vesicles that can be incorporated as part of a liquid 
biopsy-on-a-chip system for the detection of exosomal biomarkers and analysis of 
their contents for early cancer diagnosis.
