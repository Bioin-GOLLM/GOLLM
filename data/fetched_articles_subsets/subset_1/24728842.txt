Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare inflammatory neuropathy 
characterized by progressive, asymmetric distal limb weakness and conduction 
block (CB). Clinically MMN is a pure motor neuropathy, which as such can mimic 
motor neuron disease. GM1-specific IgM antibodies are present in the serum of 
approximately half of all MMN patients, and are thought to play a key role in 
the immune pathophysiology. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment has been 
shown to be effective in MMN in five randomized placebo-controlled trials. 
Despite long-term treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), which is 
efficient in the majority of patients, slowly progressive axonal degeneration 
and subsequent muscle weakness cannot be fully prevented. In this review, we 
will discuss the current understanding of the immune pathogenesis underlying MMN 
and how this may cause CB, available treatment strategies and future therapeutic 
targets.
