BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Claudin-16 and -19 are proteins forming pores for the 
paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the ascending limb of Henle 
loop; conversely, claudin-14 decreases ion permeability of these pores. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in gene coding for claudin-14 were associated 
with kidney stones and calcium excretion. This study aimed to explore the 
association of claudin-14, claudin-16, and claudin-19 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms with calcium excretion.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed a retrospective 
observational study of 393 patients with hypertension who were naïve to 
antihypertensive drugs, in whom we measured 24-hour urine calcium excretion; 
history of kidney stones was ascertained by interview; 370 of these patients 
underwent an intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride infusion (2 L in 2 hours) to 
evaluate the response of calcium excretion in three different 2-hour urine 
samples collected before, during, and after saline infusion. Genotypes of 
claudin-14, claudin-16, and claudin-19 were obtained from data of a previous 
genome-wide association study in the same patients.
RESULTS: Thirty-one single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the 3' region of the 
claudin-14 gene were significantly associated with 24-hour calcium excretion and 
calcium excretion after saline infusion. The most significant associated 
single-nucleotide polymorphism was rs219755 (24-hour calcium excretion in GG, 
225±124 mg/24 hours; 24-hour calcium excretion in GA, 194±100 mg/24 hours; 
24-hour calcium excretion in AA, 124±73 mg/24 hours; P<0.001; calcium excretion 
during saline infusion in GG, 30±21 mg/2 hours; calcium excretion during saline 
infusion in GA, 29±18 mg/2 hours; calcium excretion during saline infusion in 
AA, 17±11 mg/2 hours; P=0.03). No significant associations were found among 
claudin-16 and claudin-19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and calcium excretion 
and between claudin-14, claudin-16, and claudin-19 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms and stones. Bioinformatic analysis showed that one 
single-nucleotide polymorphism at claudin-14 among those associated with calcium 
excretion may potentially influence splicing of transcript.
CONCLUSIONS: Claudin-14 genotype at the 3' region is associated with calcium 
excretion in 24-hour urine and after the calciuretic stimulus of saline 
infusion.
