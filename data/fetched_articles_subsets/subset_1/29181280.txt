Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) play 
important roles in ovarian follicular development. In this study, we analyzed 
tissue-specific expression of the Muscovy duck IGF2 and DRD2 genes and cloned 
those genes transcripts. Polymorphisms in these genes were tightly linked with 
egg production traits and both genes were highly expressed in the ovary. 
Moreover, we identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for IGF1 and 
28 for DRD2. Mutations A-1864G and C-1704G of IGF2 were positively correlated 
with increased egg laying at 59 weeks (E59W) (P < 0.05). The C+7T and C+364G 
mutations of DRD2 were highly and significantly associated with first-egg age 
(FEA) and egg numbers at 300 days (E300D) (P < 0.01). Moreover, C+3301G and 
C+3545G of DRD2 were highly significantly associated with FEA, E59W and E300D 
(P < 0.01). Other mutations were positively associated with FEA or E300D or E59W 
(P < 0.05). These data suggest specific roles for IGF1 and DRD2 polymorphisms in 
egg production in Muscovy ducks.
