The large conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL), acts as an osmoprotective 
emergency valve in bacteria by opening a large, water-filled pore in response to 
changes in membrane tension. In its closed configuration, the last 36 residues 
at the C-terminus form a bundle of five α-helices co-linear with the five-fold 
axis of symmetry. Here, we examined the structural dynamics of the C-terminus of 
EcMscL using site-directed spin labelling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL 
EPR) spectroscopy. These experiments were complemented with computational 
modelling including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and finite element (FE) 
modelling. Our results show that under physiological conditions, the C-terminus 
is indeed an α-helical bundle, located near the five-fold symmetry axis of the 
molecule. Both experiments and computational modelling demonstrate that only the 
top part of the C-terminal domain (from the residue A110 to E118) dissociates 
during the channel gating, while the rest of the C-terminus stays assembled. 
This result is consistent with the view that the C-terminus functions as a 
molecular sieve and stabilizer of the oligomeric MscL structure as previously 
suggested.
