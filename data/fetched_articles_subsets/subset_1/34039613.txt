Globally, there is an urgency to develop effective, low-cost therapeutic 
interventions for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We previously generated 
the stable and ultrapotent homotrimeric Pittsburgh inhalable Nanobody 21 
(PiN-21). Using Syrian hamsters that model moderate to severe COVID-19 disease, 
we demonstrate the high efficacy of PiN-21 to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Intranasal delivery of PiN-21 at 0.6 mg/kg protects infected animals 
from weight loss and substantially reduces viral burdens in both lower and upper 
airways compared to control. Aerosol delivery of PiN-21 facilitates deposition 
throughout the respiratory tract and dose minimization to 0.2 mg/kg. Inhalation 
treatment quickly reverses animals' weight loss after infection, decreases lung 
viral titers by 6 logs leading to drastically mitigated lung pathology, and 
prevents viral pneumonia. Combined with the marked stability and low production 
cost, this innovative therapy may provide a convenient and cost-effective option 
to mitigate the ongoing pandemic.
