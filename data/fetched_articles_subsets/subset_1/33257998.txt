As the primary site for T cell development, the thymus is responsible for the 
production and selection of a functional, yet self-tolerant T cell repertoire. 
This critically depends on thymic stromal cells, derived from the pharyngeal 
apparatus during embryogenesis. Thymic epithelial cells, mesenchymal and 
vascular elements together form the unique and highly specialised 
microenvironment required to support all aspects of thymopoiesis and T cell 
central tolerance induction. Although rare, inborn errors of thymic stromal 
cells constitute a clinically important group of conditions because their 
immunological consequences, which include autoimmune disease and T cell 
immunodeficiency, can be life-threatening if unrecognised and untreated. In this 
review, we describe the molecular and environmental aetiologies of the thymic 
stromal cell defects known to cause disease in humans, placing particular 
emphasis on those with a propensity to cause thymic hypoplasia or aplasia and 
consequently severe congenital immunodeficiency. We discuss the principles 
underpinning their diagnosis and management, including the use of novel tools to 
aid in their identification and strategies for curative treatment, principally 
transplantation of allogeneic thymus tissue.
