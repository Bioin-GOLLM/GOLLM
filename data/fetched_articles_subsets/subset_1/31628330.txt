In the human hematopoietic system, rare self-renewing multipotent long-term 
hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) are responsible for the lifelong production 
of mature blood cells and are the rational target for clinical regenerative 
therapies. However, the heterogeneity in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment 
and variable outcomes of CRISPR/Cas9 editing make functional interrogation of 
rare LT-HSCs challenging. Here, we report high efficiency LT-HSC editing at 
single-cell resolution using electroporation of modified synthetic gRNAs and 
Cas9 protein. Targeted short isoform expression of the GATA1 transcription 
factor elicit distinct differentiation and proliferation effects in single 
highly purified LT-HSC when analyzed with functional in vitro differentiation 
and long-term repopulation xenotransplantation assays. Our method represents a 
blueprint for systematic genetic analysis of complex tissue hierarchies at 
single-cell resolution.
