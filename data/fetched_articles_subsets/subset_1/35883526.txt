A few cases of parkinsonism linked to COVID-19 infection have been reported so 
far, raising the possibility of a post-viral parkinsonian syndrome. The 
objective of this review is to summarize the clinical, biological, and 
neuroimaging features of published cases describing COVID-19-related 
parkinsonism and to discuss the possible pathophysiological mechanisms. A 
comprehensive literature search was performed using NCBI's PubMed database and 
standardized search terms. Thirteen cases of COVID-19-related parkinsonism were 
included (7 males; mean age: 51 years ± 14.51, range 31-73). Patients were 
classified based on the possible mechanisms of post-COVID-19 parkinsonism: 
extensive inflammation or hypoxic brain injury within the context of 
encephalopathy (n = 5); unmasking of underlying still non-symptomatic 
Parkinson's Disease (PD) (n = 5), and structural and functional basal ganglia 
damage (n = 3). The various clinical scenarios show different outcomes and 
responses to dopaminergic treatment. Different mechanisms may play a role, 
including vascular damage, neuroinflammation, SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasive 
potential, and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on α-synuclein. Our results confirm that 
the appearance of parkinsonism during or immediately after COVID-19 infection 
represents a very rare event. Future long-term observational studies are needed 
to evaluate the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 infection as a trigger for the 
development of PD in the long term.
