Interactions between chromosomes and LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and 
cytoskeleton) complexes in the nuclear envelope (NE) promote homolog pairing and 
synapsis during meiosis. By tethering chromosomes to cytoskeletal motors, these 
connections lead to processive chromosome movements along the NE. This activity 
is usually mediated by telomeres, but in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, 
special chromosome regions called "pairing centers" (PCs) have acquired this 
meiotic function. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized 
meiosis-specific NE protein, MJL-1 (MAJIN-Like-1), that is essential for 
interactions between PCs and LINC complexes in C. elegans. Mutations in MJL-1 
eliminate active chromosome movements during meiosis, resulting in nonhomologous 
synapsis and impaired homolog pairing. Fission yeast and mice also require NE 
proteins to connect chromosomes to LINC complexes. Extensive similarities in the 
molecular architecture of meiotic chromosome-NE attachments across eukaryotes 
suggest a common origin and/or functions of this architecture during meiosis.
