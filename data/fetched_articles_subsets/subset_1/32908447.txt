INTRODUCTION: A neuroimmune communication exists, and compelling evidence 
suggests that diabetic neuropathy and systemic inflammation are linked. Our aims 
were (1) to investigate biomarkers of the ongoing inflammation processes 
including cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemokines and (2) to associate the 
findings with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in type 1 diabetes by 
measuring heart rate variability and cardiac vagal tone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 104 adults with type 1 diabetes. Heart rate 
variability, time domain, and frequency domains were calculated from a 24-hour 
Holter electrocardiogram, while cardiac vagal tone was determined from a 
5-minute electrocardiogram. Cytokines (interleukin- (IL-) 1α, IL-4, IL-12p70, 
IL-13, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) α), adhesion molecules 
(E-selectin, P-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule- (ICAM-) 1), and 
chemokines (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)2, CCL3, CCL4, and C-X-C motif 
chemokine (CXCL)10) were assessed using a Luminex multiplexing technology. 
Associations between concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers and continuous 
variables of heart rate variability and cardiac vagal tone were estimated using 
multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and 
smoking.
RESULTS: Participants with the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy 
had higher systemic levels of IL-1α, IL-4, CCL2, and E-selectin than those 
without cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. IL-1α, IL-4, IL-12, TNF-α, and 
E-selectin were inversely associated with both sympathetic and parasympathetic 
heart rate variability measures (p > 0.01). Discussion. Our results show that 
several pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, believed to be involved in the 
progression of diabetic polyneuropathy, are associated with cardiovascular 
autonomic neuropathy, suggesting that these factors may also contribute to the 
pathogenesis of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Our findings emphasize the 
importance of the neuroimmune regulatory system in the pathogenesis of 
neuropathy in type 1 diabetes.
