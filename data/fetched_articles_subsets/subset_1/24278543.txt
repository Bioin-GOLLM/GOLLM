Coffee has been known to have both beneficial and harmful effects upon health. 
Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages, worldwide. 
Dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are public 
health problems that are rapidly increasing in the aging population. Due to the 
high consumption of coffee, even small effects on an individual's health could 
have a large effect on public health.The aim of this review article is to 
provide an overview of previously published studies of coffee consumption on 
health. Herein, we focus on epidemiological and experimental findings to 
investigate whether coffee-drinking habits, and/or the quantity of coffee 
consumption, have any relationship to CVD, dementia/AD, and other chronic 
diseases. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, when 
comparing coffee drinkers with non-drinkers, moderate doses of caffeine showed 
protective effects against CVD and AD. We hypothesized that caffeine may be a 
novel therapy to treat CVD and dementia/AD.
