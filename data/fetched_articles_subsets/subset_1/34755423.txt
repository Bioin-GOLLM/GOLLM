INTRODUCTION: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a life-threatening inherited 
channelopathy, and prolonged QT intervals easily trigger malignant arrhythmias, 
especially torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proband with overlapped phenotypes of LQTS and 
sinoatrial node dysfunction underwent some necessary examinations, including 
echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), and Holter monitoring. Next, 
whole-exome sequencing was performed, and candidate genes were validated by 
Sanger sequencing. RNA secondary structure and protein physical-chemical 
parameter analyses were used to predict the possible structural change of the 
proteins induced by the mutations.
RESULTS: We identified the digenic heterozygous mutations of KCNH2 p.307_308del 
(NM_001204798, c.921_923del) and SCN5A p.R1865H (NM_001160160, c.G5594A) in the 
female and young proband (II: 1) of LQTS and ventricular fibrillation with 
repeat syncope at rest. Subsequently, she occurred with obvious sinus arrest 
with persistent ventricular pacing of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. 
The heterozygous SCN5Ap.R1865H was carried by her father and sister but not 
carried by I:2. II:1 carried with KCNH2 p.307_308del as a de novo mutation, but 
not existed in other family members. RNA secondary structure of KCNH2 
p.307_308del showed a false regional double helix, and its amino acids' 
hydrophobicity was significantly weakened. For the Nav 1.5 protein property, 
SCN5A p.R1865H slightly increased the molecular weight and aliphatic index but 
reduced the instability index.
CONCLUSIONS: The digenic heterozygous KCNH2 and SCN5A mutations were associated 
with young early-onset long QT syndrome and sinoatrial node dysfunction.
