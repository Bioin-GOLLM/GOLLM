Sphingolipid (SL) metabolism alterations have been frequently reported in cancer 
including in melanoma, a bad-prognosis skin cancer. In normal cells, de novo 
synthesized ceramide is mainly converted to sphingomyelin (SM), the most 
abundant SL, by sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) and, albeit to a lesser extent, 
SMS2, encoded by the SGMS1 and SGMS2 genes, respectively. Alternatively, 
ceramide can be converted to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) by the GlcCer synthase 
(GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Herein, we provide evidence for the first time 
that SMS1 is frequently downregulated in various solid cancers, more 
particularly in melanoma. Accordingly, various human melanoma cells displayed a 
SL metabolism signature associated with (i) a robust and a low expression of 
UGCG and SGMS1/2, respectively, (ii) higher in situ enzyme activity of GCS than 
SMS, and (iii) higher intracellular levels of GlcCer than SM. SMS1 was expressed 
at low levels in most of the human melanoma biopsies. In addition, several 
mutations and increased CpG island methylation in the SGMS1 gene were identified 
that likely affect SMS1 expression. Finally, low SMS1 expression was associated 
with a worse prognosis in metastatic melanoma patients. Collectively, our study 
indicates that SMS1 downregulation in melanoma enhances GlcCer synthesis, 
triggering an imbalance in the SM/GlcCer homeostasis, which likely contributes 
to melanoma progression. Evaluating SMS1 expression level in tumor samples might 
serve as a biomarker to predict clinical outcome in advanced melanoma patients.
