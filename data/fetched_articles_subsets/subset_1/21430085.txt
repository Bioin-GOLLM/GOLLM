OBJECTIVE: Animal studies suggest that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) 
may impair insulin synthesis and secretion and be involved in the pathogenesis 
of diabetes. Results in studies in humans have not been consistent, however. 
Prediabetes is a stage earlier in the hyperglycemia/diabetes continuum where 
individuals are at increased risk of developing diabetes and where prevention 
efforts have been shown to be effective in delaying or preventing the onset of 
diabetes. However, previous studies have not examined the association between 
low serum 25(OH)D levels and prediabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the 12,719 participants (52.5% women) 
in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged >20 years who 
were free of diabetes. Serum 25(OH)D levels were categorized into quartiles (â‰¤ 
17.7, 17.8-24.5, 24.6-32.4, >32.4 ng/mL). Prediabetes was defined as a 2-h 
glucose concentration of 140-199 mg/dL, or a fasting glucose concentration of 
110-125 mg/dL, or an A1C value of 5.7-6.4%.
RESULTS: Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with prediabetes after 
adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, season, geographic region, smoking, 
alcohol intake, BMI, outdoor physical activity, milk consumption, dietary 
vitamin D, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and glomerular 
filtration rate. Compared with quartile 4 of 25(OH)D (referent), the odds ratio 
of prediabetes associated with quartile 1 was 1.47 (95% CI 1.16-1.85; P = 0.001 
for trend). Subgroup analyses examining the relation between 25(OH)D and 
prediabetes by sex, BMI, and hypertension categories also showed a consistent 
positive association.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with prediabetes in a 
representative sample of U.S. adults.
