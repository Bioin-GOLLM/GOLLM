BACKGROUND: Prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its rate of 
progression are higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared 
with the general population. Mineral metabolism parameters have been shown to be 
involved in the increased velocity of atheromatosis progression. The aim of this 
study is to determine the role of 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
the Klotho gene on the rate of atherosclerosis progression in CKD.
METHODS: This was a multicentre, prospective, observational study of 1439 CKD 
patients from the NEFRONA cohort. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed 
at baseline and after 24 months in 10 arterial territories. Progression of 
atheromatosis was defined as an increase in the number of territories with 
plaque. Genotyping of 11 SNPs of the Klotho gene was performed and its 
association with atheromatosis progression was determined by multivariate 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: Bivariate analysis showed that none of the 11 SNPs was associated with 
atheroma plaque prevalence, but 3 of them (rs495392, rs562020 and rs567170) 
showed association with atheromatosis progression. The multivariate analysis 
revealed that only rs495392 showed a statistically significant association with 
atheromatosis progression, after adjustment for several parameters known to 
affect it in CKD patients. Thus, the presence of one allele T was associated 
with a reduction of 30% of the odds of progression, whereas the presence of the 
two T alleles was associated with a decrease close to 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the allele T of the SNP rs495392 of the Klotho gene 
is associated with a decrease in the odds of progression of atheromatosis in CKD 
patients.
