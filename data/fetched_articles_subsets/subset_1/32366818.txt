Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) use odour-induced intracellular cAMP surge to 
gate cyclic nucleotide-gated nonselective cation (CNG) channels in cilia. 
Prolonged exposure to cAMP causes calmodulin-dependent feedback-adaptation of 
CNG channels and attenuates neural responses. On the other hand, the 
odour-source searching behaviour requires ORNs to be sensitive to odours when 
approaching targets. How ORNs accommodate these conflicting aspects of cAMP 
responses remains unknown. Here, we discover that olfactory marker protein (OMP) 
is a major cAMP buffer that maintains the sensitivity of ORNs. Upon the 
application of sensory stimuli, OMP directly captured and swiftly reduced freely 
available cAMP, which transiently uncoupled downstream CNG channel activity and 
prevented persistent depolarization. Under repetitive stimulation, OMP-/- ORNs 
were immediately silenced after burst firing due to sustained depolarization and 
inactivated firing machinery. Consequently, OMP-/- mice showed serious 
impairment in odour-source searching tasks. Therefore, cAMP buffering by OMP 
maintains the resilient firing of ORNs.
