A large proportion of patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery 
disease (CAD) is found to have ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery 
disease (INOCA). Based on current evidence, these patients are at increased risk 
of adverse cardiovascular events, even though they have no obstructive CAD. 
Importantly, INOCA is associated with recurrent clinical presentations with 
chest pain, impaired functional capacity, reduced health-related quality of 
life, and high healthcare costs. Underlying coronary microvascular dysfunction 
(CMD), through endothelium-dependent and independent mechanisms contribute to 
these adverse outcomes in INOCA. While non-invasive and invasive diagnostic 
testing has typically focused on identification of obstructive CAD in 
symptomatic patients, functional testing to detect coronary epicardial and 
microvascular dysfunction should be considered in those with INOCA who have 
persistent angina. Current diagnostic methods to clarify functional 
abnormalities and treatment strategies for epicardial and/or microvascular 
dysfunction in INOCA are reviewed.
