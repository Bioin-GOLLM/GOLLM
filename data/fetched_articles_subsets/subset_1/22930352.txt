A Danish-Swedish collaboration was established to identify and classify a Danish 
cohort of patients with epidermolytic ichthyosis, also known as epidermolytic 
hyperkeratosis. Patients were recruited from 5 dermatology departments in 
Denmark, and data were obtained using a structured questionnaire and a 
systematic examination together with photographs, histopathological descriptions 
and blood samples for mutational analysis. Sixteen patients from 12 families 
with generalized or naevoid epidermolytic ichthyosis and ichthyosis bullosa of 
Siemens were identified. Five families had mutations in K1 and 6 families had 
mutations in K10. Nine patients had been treated with systemic retinoids 
(etretinate, acitretin, isotretinoin or alitretinoin), but only 3 patients had 
acceptable treatment responses and chose to continue therapy. In conclusion 
epidermolytic ichthyosis is a rare disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 
in 350,000 in Denmark and a high percentage of de novo mutations (75%). We 
identified 4 novel disease-causing mutations.
