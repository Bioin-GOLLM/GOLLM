Sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) 
is a restriction factor blocking replication of many viruses, including human 
imMunodeficiency virus (HIV). SAMHD1 was initially identified by homology with a 
murine GTPase induced by interferon gamma (IFNγ) and known for its involvement 
in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare inflammatory disorder [1]. In 
2011, the identification of SAMHD1 as the restriction factor inhibiting 
HIV-1 infection in macrophages and dendritic cells has been a major advance in 
the field of retrovirology [2, 3] . In this review, I will discuss recent 
advances on the mechanism of SAMHD1 restriction of HIV-1, the regulation of 
SAMHD1 by the cell cycle and by cytokines, and how viruses evolved to counteract 
SAMHD1 restriction.
