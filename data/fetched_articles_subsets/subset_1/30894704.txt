PURPOSE: Genetic sequencing for children with congenital diarrhea and 
enteropathy (CODE) has important implications for the diagnosis, prognosis, and 
implementation of precision medicine.
METHODS: We performed exome sequencing or targeted panel sequencing on 137 
children with CODE. Endoscopic, imaging, histological, and immunological 
assessments were also applied. Patients were divided into three subgroups: 
watery, fatty, and bloody diarrhea.
RESULTS: The median age of onset among patients was 28.0 (interquartile range: 
7.5-120.0) days. Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 88/137 (64.2%) of patients. 
The diagnostic rate was significantly higher in the neonatal group than in the 
group of patients who had disease onset within 2 years of age (p = 0.033). The 
diagnostic rates were 71.9% (46/64) for targeted gene panel sequencing and 57.5% 
(42/73) for exome sequencing (p = 0.081). We identified pathogenic variants in 
17 genes. Based on genetic sequencing, 59.9% of patients were diagnosed with 
medically actionable disorders. Precision medicine was carried out by means of 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with IL10RA, CYBB, or FOXP3 
deficiency; pancreatic enzyme replacement for patients with SBDS or UBR1 
deficiency; and a special diet for patients with SLC5A1 deficiency. The overall 
mortality rate was 14.6%.
CONCLUSION: Single-gene disorders are common among CODE patients. Genetic 
diagnosis can improve therapy by enabling precision medicine.
