Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells that are 
the causative agents responsible for spotted fever and typhus. Their small 
genome (about 800 protein-coding genes) is highly conserved across species and 
has been postulated as the ancestor of the mitochondria. No genes that are 
required for glycolysis are found in the Rickettsia prowazekii or mitochondrial 
genomes, but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic 
acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in both. A 2.4 Ã… 
resolution crystal structure of R. prowazekii fumarate hydratase, an enzyme 
catalyzing the third step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway that 
ultimately converts phosphoenolpyruvate into succinyl-CoA, has been solved. A 
structure alignment with human mitochondrial fumarate hydratase highlights the 
close similarity between R. prowazekii and mitochondrial enzymes.
