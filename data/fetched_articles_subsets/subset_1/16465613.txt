Cardiovascular (CV) disease is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory 
disease, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Furthermore it has become clear at 
a pathophysiological level, that atherosclerosis has striking similarities with 
autoimmune disease. This realization has come at a time of paradigm shift in how 
rheumatologists manage RA, with the availability of biological agents targeting 
key inflammatory cytokines. This review will focus on the possible causes of 
increased vascular disease in RA, including the role of traditional CV risk 
factors. Mechanisms potentially at play, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), 
altered coagulation, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors will be covered in 
brief. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has been 
identified as a candidate molecule influencing response to ongoing inflammation 
and autoimmunity. There will be a focus on the role of RAGE in CV disease and 
RA. As has been the case with many novel molecules, functional polymorphisms are 
thought to alter disease expression and assist us in coming to terms with the 
biological activities of the parent molecule. The review will conclude with a 
discussion of the potential role of the RAGE Glycine 82 Serine polymorphism.
