Protein fatty acylation regulates diverse aspects of cellular function and 
organization and plays a key role in host immune responses to infection. 
Acylation also modulates the function and localization of virus-encoded 
proteins. Here, we employ chemical proteomics tools, bio-orthogonal probes, and 
capture reagents to study myristoylation and palmitoylation during infection 
with herpes simplex virus (HSV). Using in-gel fluorescence imaging and 
quantitative mass spectrometry, we demonstrate a generalized reduction in 
myristoylation of host proteins, whereas palmitoylation of host proteins, 
including regulators of interferon and tetraspanin family proteins, was 
selectively repressed. Furthermore, we found that a significant fraction of the 
viral proteome undergoes palmitoylation; we identified a number of virus 
membrane glycoproteins, structural proteins, and kinases. Taken together, our 
results provide broad oversight of protein acylation during HSV infection, a 
roadmap for similar analysis in other systems, and a resource with which to 
pursue specific analysis of systems and functions.
