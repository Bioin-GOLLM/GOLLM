BACKGROUND: Growing evidence from dogs and humans supports the abundance of 
mutation-based biomarkers in tumors of dogs. Increasing the use of clinical 
genomic diagnostic testing now provides another powerful data source for 
biomarker discovery.
HYPOTHESIS: Analyzed clinical outcomes in dogs with cancer profiled using 
SearchLight DNA, a cancer gene panel for dogs, to identify mutations with 
prognostic value.
ANIMALS: A total of 127 cases of cancer in dogs were analyzed using SearchLight 
DNA and for which clinical outcome information was available.
METHODS: Clinical data points were collected by medical record review. Variables 
including mutated genes, mutations, signalment, and treatment were fitted using 
Cox proportional hazard models to identify factors associated with 
progression-free survival (PFS). The log-rank test was used to compare PFS 
between patients receiving and not receiving targeted treatment before first 
progression.
RESULTS: Combined genomic and outcomes analysis identified 336 unique mutations 
in 89 genes across 26 cancer types. Mutations in 6 genes (CCND1, CCND3, SMARCB1, 
FANCG, CDKN2A/B, and MSH6) were significantly associated with shorter PFS. Dogs 
that received targeted treatment before first progression (n = 45) experienced 
significantly longer PFS compared with those that did not (n = 82, P = .01). 
This significance held true for 29 dogs that received genomically informed 
targeted treatment compared with those that did not (P = .05).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We identified novel mutations with 
prognostic value and demonstrate the benefit of targeted treatment across 
multiple cancer types. These results provide clinical evidence of the potential 
for genomics and precision medicine in dogs with cancer.
