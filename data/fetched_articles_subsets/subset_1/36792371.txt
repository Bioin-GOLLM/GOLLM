BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus has 
a predominant role in the genetic predisposition to multiple sclerosis (MS), 
with 32 associations found to be involved. We aimed to investigate the impact of 
MHC MS-risk alleles on T-cell repertoire in patients with MS.
METHODS: We studied 161 untreated patients with relapsing-remitting MS for whom 
Class I and II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were inferred from 
whole-genome genotyping data, and T-cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 sequences were 
obtained through next-generation sequencing. T-cell repertoire features 
including diversity, public clones, and architecture were evaluated.
RESULTS: We identified 5 MS-risk loci associated with TCR diversity: 
HLA-DRB1*15:01 (7.65 × 10-3), rs9271366 (1.96 × 10-3), rs766848979 A (1.89 × 
10-2), rs9277626 (2.95 × 10-2), and rs11751659 (1.92 × 10-2), with evidence of 
expanded clonotypes in carriers of risk alleles. Moreover, HLA-DRB1*15:01 (4.99 
× 10-3), rs9271366 (6.54 × 10-3), rs1049079 C (4.37 × 10-2), AA DQΒ1 position -5 
L (1.05 × 10-3), and AA DQΒ1 position 221 Q (9.39 × 10-4) showed an association 
with the CDR3 aminoacidic sequence architecture, suggesting an impact on the 
antigen recognition breadth as well. Evaluating the sharing of clones across 
MS-risk allele carrier individuals revealed the presence of highly shared 
clonotypes predicted to target viral antigens, including Epstein-Barr virus.
DISCUSSION: Our study supports the association between MHC-risk alleles and 
macrofeatures of the T-cell repertoire in the context of MS. Further studies are 
needed to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.
