The American Diabetes Association's Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 
emphasize the need for awareness regarding overbasalization (basal insulin doses 
>0.5 units/kg/day without bolus insulin) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
However, outcomes data on the impact of overbasalization are limited. This post 
hoc analysis of a large randomized controlled trial suggests that an insulin 
therapy regimen involving overbasalization compared with a basal-bolus insulin 
regimen that avoids overbasalization is less effective at lowering A1C and may 
be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Clinicians should consider 
alternative approaches to glycemic control before increasing basal insulin doses 
to >0.5 units/kg/day.
