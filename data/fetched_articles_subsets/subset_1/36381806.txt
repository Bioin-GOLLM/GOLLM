Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is responsible for encoding 13 subunits of the 
respiratory chain. These subunits are crucial in providing reducing equivalents 
for the energy-intensive intracellular processes. Leber hereditary optic 
neuropathy (LHON) is a mitochondrial illness that causes carcinogenesis due to 
oxidative stress and painless loss of central vision as a result of selective 
degradation of retinal ganglion cells as well as their axons. We present a case 
of a 23-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with subacute LHON. The mutation 
in our patient was found in a less commonly mutated exon sequence of MT-NDL4, 
which codes for NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen, reduced) 
dehydrogenase subunit 4L. The MT-ND4L exon is located immediately upstream of 
the MTD4 exon on the human mtDNA. The take-home message is to always perform a 
comprehensive mitochondrial genome analysis for identifying rare mutations when 
LHON is suspected.
