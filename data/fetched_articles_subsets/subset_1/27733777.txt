The contribution of genetic predisposing factors to the development of pediatric 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 
childhood, has not been fully elucidated. Children presenting with multiple de 
novo leukemias are more likely to suffer from genetic predisposition. Here, we 
selected five of these patients and analyzed the mutational spectrum of normal 
and malignant tissues. In two patients, we identified germline mutations in 
TYK2, a member of the JAK tyrosine kinase family. These mutations were located 
in two adjacent codons of the pseudokinase domain (p.Pro760Leu and p.Gly761Val). 
In silico modeling revealed that both mutations affect the conformation of this 
autoregulatory domain. Consistent with this notion, both germline mutations 
promote TYK2 autophosphorylation and activate downstream STAT family members, 
which could be blocked with the JAK kinase inhibitor I. These data indicate that 
germline activating TYK2 mutations predispose to the development of ALL.
