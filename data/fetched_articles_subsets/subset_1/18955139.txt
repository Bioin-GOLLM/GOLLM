The control of organ size is a basic biological question. In the past several 
years, the Hippo signaling pathway has been delineated and shown to be crucial 
in control of organ size in both Drosophila and mammals. Acting downstream of 
the Hippo pathway is the Yki/YAP/TAZ transcription co-activators. In mammalian 
cells, the Hippo pathway kinase cascade inhibits YAP and its paralog TAZ by 
phosphorylation and promotion of their cytoplasmic localization. The TEAD family 
transcription factors have recently been identified as evolutionarily conserved 
key mediators of YAP biological functions. yap is a candidate oncogene, and 
several other components of the Hippo pathway are tumor suppressors. 
Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway contributes to the loss of contact inhibition 
observed in cancer cells. Therefore, the Hippo-YAP pathway connects the 
regulation of organ size and tumorigenesis.
