OBJECTIVES: The relationships of Paired Like Homeodomain 2 (PITX2), Ninjurin 2 
(NINJ2), TWIST-Related Protein 1 (TWIST1), Ras Interacting Protein 1 (Rasip1), 
Solute Carrier Family 17 Member 3 (SLC17A3), Methylmalonyl Co-A Mutase (MUT) and 
Fer3 Like BHLH Transcription Factor (FERD3L) polymorphisms and gene expression 
with ischemic stroke have yet to be determined in Malaysia. Hence, this study 
aimed to explore the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
gene expression with ischemic stroke risk among population who resided at the 
Northern region of Malaysia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study subjects including 216 ischemic stroke patients and 
203 healthy controls were recruited upon obtaining ethical clearance. SNP 
genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism assays. Gene expression levels were quantified by real-time 
polymerase chain reaction assays. Statistical and genetic analyses were 
conducted with SPSS version 22.2, PLINK version 1.07 and multifactor 
dimensionality reduction software.
RESULTS: Study subjects with G allele, CG or GG genotypes of SLC17A3 rs9379800 
demonstrated increased risk of ischemic stroke with the odds ratios ranging from 
1.76-fold to 3.14-fold (p<0.05). When stratified study subjects according to the 
ethnicity, SLC17A3 rs9379800 G allele and CG genotype contributed to 2.14- and 
2.96-fold of ischemic stroke risk among Malay population significantly, in the 
multivariate analysis (p<0.05). However, no significant associations were 
observed for PITX2, NINJ2, TWIST1, Rasip1, and MUT polymorphisms with ischemic 
stroke risk in the multivariate analysis for the pooled cases and controls as 
well as when stratified them according to the ethnicity. Lower mRNA expression 
levels of Rasip1, SLC17A3, MUT and FERD3L were observed among cases (p<0.05). 
After FDR adjustment, the mRNA level of SLC17A3 remained significantly 
associated with ischemic stroke among Malay population (q=0.034).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study suggests that SLC17A3 rs9379800 
polymorphism and its gene expression contribute to significant ischemic stroke 
risk among Malaysian population, particularly the Malay who resided at the 
Northern Region of the country. Our findings can provide useful information for 
the future diagnosis, management and treatment of ischemic stroke patients.
