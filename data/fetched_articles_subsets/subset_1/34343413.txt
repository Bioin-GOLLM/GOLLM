BACKGROUND: The occurrence of allergic conditions, for example allergic asthma, 
rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, is rising worldwide. These allergic conditions 
are associated with poor life quality. Vitamin D is proposed to be linked with 
increased risk and severe forms of allergic diseases.
AIMS: This review article aimed to evaluate the vitamin D level role and 
polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) in atopy.
METHODS & MATERIALS: We analyzed publications that were focusing on levels of 
vitamin D and/or polymorphism analysis of vitamin D receptor gene in allergic 
asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis patients.
RESULTS: We noticed that levels of vitamin D are extensively studied in atopy by 
many research groups, however, polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor gene and 
their link with levels of vitamin D lack comprehensive data. There is evidence 
that vitamin D may be associated with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic 
diseases. Some of VDR polymorphisms also may play a role in pathogenesis of 
these diseases. However, the data from different studies are controversial.
DISCUSSION: The results of different studies are usually inconsistent, most 
probably due to populational bias or differences in methodology. Even though, 
more evidence shows a positive impact of vitamin D on the risk and outcomes of 
allergic diseases, especially atopic dermatitis, and asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: There is controversial data about the level of vitamin D and its 
role in atopy; however, more evidence shows a positive impact on the risk and 
outcomes of allergic diseases.
