In the modern diet, excessive fructose intake (>50 g/day) had been driven by the 
increase, in recent decades, of the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. 
This phenomenon has dramatically increased within the Caribbean and Latin 
American regions. Epidemiological studies show that chronic high intake of 
fructose related to sugar-sweetened beverages increases the risk of developing 
several non-communicable diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
and asthma, and may also contribute to the exacerbation of lung diseases, such 
as COVID-19. Evidence supports several mechanisms—such as dysregulation of the 
renin−angiotensin system, increased uric acid production, induction of aldose 
reductase activity, production of advanced glycation end-products, and 
activation of the mTORC1 pathway—that can be implicated in lung damage. This 
review addresses how these pathophysiologic and molecular mechanisms may explain 
the lung damage resulting from high intake of fructose.
