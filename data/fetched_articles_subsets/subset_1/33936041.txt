BACKGROUND: Wiskott Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is characterized by bleeding 
manifestations, recurrent infections, eczema, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Over 
the last decade, improved awareness and better in-house diagnostic facilities at 
several centers in India has resulted in increased recognition of WAS. This 
study reports collated data across major primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) 
centers in India that are involved in care of children with WAS and highlights 
the varied clinical presentations, genetic profile, and outcomes of patients in 
India.
METHODS: Request to share data was sent to multiple centers in India that are 
involved in care and management of patients with PID. Six centers provided 
requisite data that were compiled and analyzed.
RESULTS: In this multi-institutional cohort, clinical details of 108 patients 
who had a provisional diagnosis of WAS were received. Of these, 95 patients with 
'definite WAS' were included Fourteen patients were classified as XLT and 81 
patients as WAS. Median age at onset of symptoms of patients was 3 months (IQR 
1.6, 6.0 months) and median age at diagnosis was 12 months (IQR 6,48 months). 
Clinical profile included bleeding episodes (92.6%), infections (84.2%), eczema 
(78.9%), various autoimmune manifestations (40%), and malignancy (2.1%). DNA 
analysis revealed 47 variants in 67 cases. Nonsense and missense variants were 
the most common (28.4% each), followed by small deletions (19.4%), and splice 
site defects (16.4%). We also report 24 novel variants, most of these being 
frameshift and nonsense mutations resulting in premature termination of protein 
synthesis. Prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) was initiated in 52 
patients (54.7%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was carried out 
in 25 patients (26.3%). Of those transplanted, disease-free survival was seen in 
15 patients (60%). Transplant related mortality was 36%. Outcome details were 
available for 89 patients. Of these, 37% had died till the time of this 
analysis. Median duration of follow-up was 36 months (range 2 weeks- 12 years; 
IQR 16.2 months- 70 months).
CONCLUSIONS: We report the first nationwide cohort of patients with WAS from 
India. Bleeding episodes and infections are common manifestations. Mortality 
continues to be high as curative therapy is not accessible to most of our 
patients.
