Altered metabolism is fundamental to the growth and survival of cancer cells. 
Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a key enzyme in cancer metabolism, has been 
demonstrated to play a central role not only in metabolic reprogramming but also 
in direct regulation of gene expression and subsequent cell cycle progression. 
This review outlines the current understanding of PKM2 protein kinase activity 
and regulatory mechanisms underlying PKM2 expression, enzymatic activity, and 
nuclear localization, thus highlighting PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target.
