Extensive studies over the years have shown that the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) 
exhibits negative regulatory effects on the activation of the mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade. We examined the potential involvement of 
AMPK in the regulation of growth and survival of malignant melanoma cells. In 
studies using the AMPK activators AICAR or metformin, we found potent inhibitory 
effects of AMPK activity on the growth of SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 malignant 
melanoma cells. Induction of AMPK activity was also associated with inhibition 
of the ability of melanoma cells to form colonies in an anchorage-independent 
manner in soft agar, suggesting an important role of the pathway in the control 
of malignant melanoma tumorigenesis. Furthermore, AICAR-treatment resulted in 
malignant melanoma cell death and such induction of apoptosis was further 
enhanced by concomitant statin-treatment. Taken together, our results provide 
evidence for potent inhibitory effects of AMPK on malignant melanoma cell growth 
and survival and raise the potential of AMPK manipulation as a novel future 
approach for the treatment of malignant melanoma.
