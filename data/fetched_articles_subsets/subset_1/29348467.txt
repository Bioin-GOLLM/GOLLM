Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a deadly malignancy with limited 
treatment options. Gain-of-function mutations in K-Ras is a very frequent 
alteration, occurring in ~15 to 25% of human iCCA patients. Here, we established 
a new iCCA model by expressing activated forms of Notch1 (NICD) and K-Ras 
(K-RasV12D) in the mouse liver (K-Ras/NICD mice). Furthermore, we investigated 
the therapeutic potential of MEK inhibitors in vitro and in vivo using human CCA 
cell lines and K-Ras/NICD mice, respectively. Treatment with U0126, PD901, and 
Selumetinib MEK inhibitors triggered growth restraint in all CCA cell lines 
tested, with the most pronounced growth suppressive effects being observed in 
K-Ras mutant cells. Growth inhibition was due to reduction in proliferation and 
massive apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment of K-Ras/NICD tumor-bearing mice with 
PD901 resulted in stable disease. At the molecular level, PD901 efficiently 
inhibited ERK activation in K-Ras/NICD tumor cells, mainly leading to increased 
apoptosis. Altogether, our study demonstrates that K-Ras/NICD mice represent a 
novel and useful preclinical model to study K-Ras-driven iCCA development and 
the effectiveness of MEK inhibitors in counteracting this process. Our data 
support the usefulness of MEK inhibitors for the treatment of human iCCA.
