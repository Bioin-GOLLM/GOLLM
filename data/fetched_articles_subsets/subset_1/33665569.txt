Black tea is the most widely consumed tea drink in the world and has 
consistently been reported to possess anti-aging benefits. However, whether 
theaflavins, one type of the characteristic phytochemicals in black tea 
extracts, are involved in regulating aging and lifespan in consumers remains 
largely unknown. In this study, we show that theaflavins play a beneficial role 
in preventing age-onset intestinal leakage and dysbiosis, thus delaying aging in 
Drosophila. Mechanistically, theaflavins regulate the condensate assembly of Imd 
to negatively govern the overactivation of Imd signals in fruit fly intestines. 
In addition, theaflavins prevent DSS-induced colitis in mice, suggesting 
theaflavins play a role in modulating intestinal integrity. Overall, our study 
reveals a molecular mechanism by which theaflavins regulate gut homeostasis 
likely through controlling Imd coalescence.
