BACKGROUND: A novel flash glucose monitoring system (FGMS) (FreeStyle Libre, 
Abbott, UK) was recently developed for humans. It continuously measures the 
interstitial glucose (IG) concentrations for 14 days.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and analytical accuracy of the FGMS in 
diabetic dogs.
ANIMALS: Ten client-owned diabetic dogs on insulin treatment.
METHODS: Prospective and observational study. The FGMS was placed on the neck 
for up to 14 days. During the 1st-2nd, 6-7th, and 13-14th days from application, 
the IG measurements were compared with the plasma (EDTA) glucose (PG) 
concentrations analyzed by a reference hexokinase based method.
RESULTS: The application and the use of the FGMS were apparently painless, easy, 
and well tolerated by all dogs. Mild erythema at the site of the application was 
found in 5/10 dogs at the end of the wearing period. A good correlation between 
IG and PG concentrations (rho = 0.94; P < .001) was found. The FGMS was 93, 99, 
and 99% accurate at low, normal, and high blood glucose concentrations. Mean ± 
standard deviation difference from the reference method was 2.3 ± 46.8 mg/dL.
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The FGMS is easy to use and is accurate for 
IG glucose measurement in diabetic dogs.
