BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most frequent genetic diseases 
and the median survival of these patients has improved in the last few decades, 
therefore it becomes necessary to evaluate the long-term complications as renal 
and cardiovascular risk factors.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the incidence, the manifestations of renal disease 
and the possible association with metabolic and endothelial dysfunction markers 
in the CF population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional, observational study on 
226 CF patients. Clinical and laboratory instrumental parameters (metabolic, 
inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction markers) were evaluated.
RESULTS: We showed 65 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 158 
patients with a reduced value of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), of 
which 58 patients with a severe reduction of FEV1. Moreover 28 patients had 
undergone lung transplantation and them had a significant lower estimated 
Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) with respect to the non-transplanted patients 
(p < 0.001). We reported also a significant association between lower eGFR value 
and serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) 
(p = 0.005, p < 0.001, p = 0.040; respectively), with a significant negative 
correlation between eGFR and serum triglycerides (r = - 0.28; p < 0.01). 
Moreover we found a significant association between lower eGFR value and serum 
uric acid (SUA) (p = 0.005), while we did not found an association with 
25-hydroxy-vitamin-D value, serum glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a high prevalence of CKD in CF patients. Moreover 
we showed an increase of endothelial dysfunction and metabolic indexes in 
patients with reduced renal function, as SUA, serum triglycerides and LDL, 
suggesting the need for an early and complete screening of the main metabolic 
indexes to reduce cardiovascular risk and progression of renal damage, in 
particular in patients with lung transplant.
