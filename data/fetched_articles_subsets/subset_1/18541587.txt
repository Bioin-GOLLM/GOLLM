BACKGROUND: Plasma apolipoprotein (apo) C-III strongly predicts myocardial 
infarction (MI) and directly activates atherogenic processes in vascular cells. 
Genetic variation in the insulin response element of the APOC3 promoter is 
associated with an increased risk of MI.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine whether the APOC3 promoter variation 
affects plasma apo C-III concentrations and MI only when insulin sensitivity is 
normal.
DESIGN: The APOC3*222 haplotype, defined by the minor alleles of the single 
nucleotide polymorphisms 3238C-->G, -455T-->C, and -482C-->T, was studied in 
1703 matched nonfatal case-control pairs with MI in the Central Valley of Costa 
Rica. We used fasting hyperglycemia and abdominal obesity as surrogates for 
insulin sensitivity.
RESULTS: The APOC3*222 haplotype was associated with higher apo C-III 
concentrations only in those with the lowest waist circumference or fasting 
glucose concentration. The association between the APOC3*222 haplotype and 
nonfatal MI, previously reported in this population, was strongly influenced by 
fasting hyperglycemia and abdominal obesity. The odds ratios for MI for the 
APOC3*222 haplotype were 1.72 (95% CI: 1.16, 2.54) and 1.84 (1.31, 2.59) in 
subjects in the lowest quintiles of abdominal obesity and fasting hyperglycemia, 
respectively, and were 0.75 (0.54, 1.05) and 1.16 (0.85, 1.59) in subjects in 
the highest quintiles, respectively (P for interaction <0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results support the concept that mutations in the APOC3 promoter 
inhibit the down-regulation of APOC3 expression by insulin. This 
cardioprotective system becomes dysfunctional in abdominal obesity and 
hyperglycemia.
