The fission yeast scaffold molecule Sid4 anchors the septum initiation network 
to the spindle pole body (SPB, centrosome equivalent) to control mitotic exit 
events. A second SPB-associated scaffold, Cut12, promotes SPB-associated 
Cdk1-cyclin B to drive mitotic commitment. Signals emanating from each scaffold 
have been assumed to operate independently to promote two distinct outcomes. We 
now find that signals from Sid4 contribute to the Cut12 mitotic commitment 
switch. Specifically, phosphorylation of Sid4 by NIMAFin1 reduces Sid4 affinity 
for its SPB anchor, Ppc89, while also enhancing Sid4's affinity for casein 
kinase 1δ (CK1δ). The resulting phosphorylation of Sid4 by the newly docked CK1δ 
recruits Chk2Cds1 to Sid4. Chk2Cds1 then expels the Cdk1-cyclin B antagonistic 
phosphatase Flp1/Clp1 from the SPB. Flp1/Clp1 departure can then support mitotic 
commitment when Cdk1-cyclin B activation at the SPB is compromised by reduction 
of Cut12 function. Such integration of signals emanating from neighboring 
scaffolds shows how centrosomes/SPBs can integrate inputs from multiple pathways 
to control cell fate.
