OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of adrenergic receptor (ADR) gene 
polymorphisms and their gene-gene interactions to the variability of exercise 
training-induced body fat response.
RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This was an intervention study that used a 
volunteer sample of 70 healthy, sedentary men (n = 29) and postmenopausal women 
(n = 41) 50 to 75 years of age, with a BMI < or = 37 kg/m2, from the Washington, 
DC, metropolitan area. Participants completed 6 weeks of dietary stabilization 
(American Heart Association diet) before 24 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise 
training. Diet was maintained throughout the intervention. Change in percent 
total body fat, percent trunk fat, and fat mass by DXA in ADR genotype groups 
(Glu12/Glu9 alpha2b-ADR, Trp64Arg beta3-ADR, and Gln27Glu beta2-ADR) at baseline 
and after 24 weeks of aerobic exercise training was measured.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis (covariates: age, gender, and baseline value 
of phenotype), best fit models for percent total body and trunk fat response to 
exercise training retained main effects of all three ADR gene loci and the 
effects of each gene-gene interaction (p = 0.009 and 0.003, respectively). 
Similarly, there was a trend for the fat mass response model (p = 0.03). The 
combined genetic factors explained 17.5% of the overall model variability for 
percent total body fat, 22% for percent trunk fat, and 10% for fat mass.
DISCUSSION: The body fat response to exercise training in older adults is 
associated with the combined effects of the Glu12/Glu9 alpha2b-, Trp64Arg 
beta3-, and Gln27Glu beta2-ADR gene variants and their gene-gene interactions.
