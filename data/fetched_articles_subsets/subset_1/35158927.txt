Effectual cell-to-cell communication is essential to the development and 
differentiation of organisms, the preservation of tissue tasks, and the 
synchronization of their different physiological actions, but also to the 
proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are 
membrane-enclosed tubular connections between cells that carry a multiplicity of 
cellular loads, such as exosomes, non-coding RNAs, mitochondria, and proteins, 
and they have been identified as the main participants in healthy and tumoral 
cell communication. TNTs have been described in numerous tumors in in vitro, ex 
vivo, and in vivo models favoring the onset and progression of tumors. Tumor 
cells utilize TNT-like membranous channels to transfer information between 
themselves or with the tumoral milieu. As a result, tumor cells attain novel 
capabilities, such as the increased capacity of metastasis, metabolic 
plasticity, angiogenic aptitude, and chemoresistance, promoting tumor severity. 
Here, we review the morphological and operational characteristics of TNTs and 
their influence on hematologic malignancies' progression and resistance to 
therapies, focusing on acute and chronic myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemia. 
Finally, we examine the prospects and challenges for TNTs as a therapeutic 
approach for hematologic diseases by examining the development of efficient and 
safe drugs targeting TNTs.
