The HEM12 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes uroporphyrinogen 
decarboxylase which catalyzes the sequential decarboxylation of the four acetyl 
side chains of uroporphyrinogen to yield coproporphyrinogen, an intermediate in 
protoheme biosynthesis. The gene was isolated by functional complementation of a 
hem12 mutant. Sequencing revealed that the HEM12 gene encodes a protein of 362 
amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 41,348 Da. The amino acid 
sequence shares 50% identity with human and rat uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase 
and shows 40% identity with the N-terminus of an open reading frame described in 
Synechococcus sp. We determined the sequence of two hem12 mutations which lead 
to a totally inactive enzyme. They correspond to the amino acid changes 
Gly33----Asp and Gly300----Asp, located in two evolutionarily conserved regions. 
Each of these substitutions impairs binding of substrates without affecting the 
overall conformation of the protein. These results argue that a single active 
center exists in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
