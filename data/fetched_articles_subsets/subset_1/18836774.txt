In this work we have analyzed the genetic variation that can alter the 
expression and the function of the VHL gene using computational methods. Of 110 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 33 were found to be nonsynonymous 
(nsSNPs) and 23 SNPs were found in untranslated regions. Of the 33 nsSNPs 
investigated, 36.3% were found to be deleterious by both SIFT and PolyPhen 
servers. An untranslated region (UTR) resource tool suggested that two SNPs in 
the 5' UTR region and six SNPs in the 3' UTR region might change the protein 
expression levels. It was found by both SIFT and PolyPhen servers that a 
mutation from histidine to arginine at position 115 of the native protein of the 
VHL gene was most deleterious. A structural analysis of this mutated protein and 
the native protein was performed and had a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 
2.78 A. Based on this work, we propose that the nsSNP with a SNPid of rs5030812 
is an important candidate for the cause of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome via the 
VHL gene.
