Most invertases identified to date have optimal activity at acidic pH, and are 
intolerant to neutral or alkaline environments. Here, an acid invertase named 
uninv2 is described. Uninv2 contained 586 amino acids, with a 100 amino acids 
N-terminal domain, a catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain. With sucrose as 
the substrate, uninv2 activity was optimal at pH 4.5 and at 45째C. Removal of 
N-terminal domain of uninv2 has shifted the optimum pH to 6.0 while retaining 
its optimum temperaure at 45째C. Both uninv2 and the truncated enzyme retained 
highly stable at neutral pH at 37째C, and they were stable at their optimum pH at 
4째C for as long as 30 days. These characteristics make them far superior to 
invertase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is mostly used as industrial 
enzyme.
