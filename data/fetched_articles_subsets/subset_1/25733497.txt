BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity is increasing in most industrialized and 
developing countries. We aimed to investigate the association between leptin 
(LEP) G-2548A polymorphisms and the risk of obesity.
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure databases for studies that evaluated the association between LEP 
G-2548A polymorphisms and obesity risk prior to March 2014. The odds ratio (OR) 
and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the risk of 
obesity. Meta-analysis of subgroup populations and different control sources was 
conducted using homozygote (AA vs. GG), allelic (A vs. G), dominant (AA+GA vs. 
GG), recessive (AA vs. GG+GA), and heterozygote (AG vs. GG) models. The 
heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using χ(2)-tests based on 
Q-statistics. The pooled ORs were calculated using a random-effects model if 
there was no heterogeneity; otherwise, a random-effects model was used. Two 
authors extracted the data independently. The funnel plots, Begg's and Egger's 
test were used to assess publication bias. All statistical analyses were 
performed using STATA 12.0 software.
RESULTS: Nine case-controlled publications that evaluated the association 
between LEP G-2548A polymorphisms and obesity risk, which included 2594 subjects 
(1235 obesity cases and 1359 controls), were included in our meta-analysis. No 
significant association between this polymorphism and obesity risk was observed 
(P>0.05). Significant heterogeneity was detected among the studies. The results 
of subgroup analysis according to ethnicity and different control groups 
suggested that LEP G-2548A polymorphisms might increase the obesity risk in 
African populations in the homozygote (AA vs. GG: OR=2.38, 95% CI=1.15-4.93, 
P=0.020) and recessive (AA vs. GG+GA: OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.34-3.06, P=0.001) 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this meta-analysis indicated that LEP G-2548A 
polymorphisms are not associated with obesity risk, although significant 
associations were observed in the homozygote model (AA vs. GG) and the recessive 
model (AA vs. GG+GA) in Africa populations. Further studies are still needed to 
validate and confirm this association.
