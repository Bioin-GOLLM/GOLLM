Increased inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to severe 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and long-term disease manifestations 
referred to as post-acute sequalae of COVID (PASC). The mechanisms of this 
variable long-term immune activation are poorly defined. Autoantibodies 
targeting immune factors such as cytokines, as well as the viral host cell 
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), have been observed after 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Autoantibodies to immune factors and ACE2 could interfere 
with normal immune regulation and lead to increased inflammation, severe 
COVID-19, and long-term complications. Here, we deeply pro led the features of 
ACE2, cytokine, and chemokine autoantibodies in samples from patients recovering 
from severe COVID-19. We identified epitopes in the catalytic domain of ACE2 
targeted by these antibodies, that could inhibit ACE2 function. Levels of 
autoantibodies targeting ACE2 and other immune factors could serve as 
determinants of COVID-19 disease severity, and represent a natural 
immunoregulatory mechanism in response to viral infection.
