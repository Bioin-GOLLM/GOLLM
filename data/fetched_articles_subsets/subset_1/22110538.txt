Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and ongoing sporadic avian-to-human 
transmission of H5N1 viruses, an emphasis has been placed on better 
understanding the determinants and pathogenesis of severe influenza infections. 
Much of the current literature has focused on viral genetics and its impact on 
host immunity as well as novel risk factors for severe infection (particularly 
within the H1N1 pandemic). An understanding of the host genetic determinants of 
susceptibility and severe respiratory illness, however, is currently lacking. By 
better defining the role of genetic variability in influenza infection and 
identifying key polymorphisms that impair the host immune response or correlate 
with protection, we will be able to better identify at-risk populations and new 
targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccines. This paper will summarize 
known immunogenetic factors associated with susceptibility or severity of both 
pH1N1 and H5N1 infections and will also identify genetic pathways and 
polymorphisms of high relevance for future study.
