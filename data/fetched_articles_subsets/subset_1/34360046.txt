To assess the relative transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant compared 
to the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 in Japan, we performed a cross-sectional study to 
determine the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 in household contacts before and 
after the Alpha variant became dominant in Osaka. We accessed 290 household 
contacts whose index cases were diagnosed between 1 and 20 December 2020 (the 
third epidemic group), at a time when Osaka was free of the Alpha variant. We 
also accessed 398 household contacts whose index cases were diagnosed between 20 
April and 3 May 2021 (the fourth epidemic group), by which time the Alpha 
variant had become dominant. We identified 124 household contacts whose index 
case was determined positive for the Alpha variant (Alpha group) in this fourth 
group. The secondary attack rates in the fourth group (34.7%) and the Alpha 
group (38.7%) were significantly higher than that in the third group (19.3%, p < 
0.001). Multivariable Poisson regression analysis with a robust error variance 
showed a significant excess risk in the fourth group (1.90, 95% CI = 1.47-2.48) 
and the Alpha group (2.34, 95% CI = 1.71-3.21). This finding indicates that the 
SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant has an approximately 1.9-2.3-fold higher 
transmissibility than the pre-existing virus in the Japanese population.
