Saeed A, Arshad M, Khera RA, Bolte M.

The 3,5-meth-oxy groups in the title compound, C(16)H(23)NO(4), are almost 
coplanar with the aromatic ring, whereas the 4-meth-oxy group is bent out of 
this plane. The three CH(3)-O-C-C torsion angles are -1.51 (18), 0.73 (19) and 
75.33 (15)°. The cyclo-hexane ring adopts a chair conformation. In the crystal, 
mol-ecules are connected by inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds into chains 
running along the b axis.
