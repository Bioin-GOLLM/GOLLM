Blast crisis (BC) is one of the most dreaded complications of chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML). Fortunately, the incidence of BC has diminished markedly in the 
BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. The primary objective of initial 
treatment in BC is to achieve a second chronic phase (CP) and to proceed to an 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in eligible patients. The clinical 
outcome of patients with CML BC remains unsatisfactory, even with highly potent 
TKIs, as remissions are short lived and there is an unmet need for novel 
therapies. We provide a comprehensive summary reviewing the current management 
of Lymphoid BC.
