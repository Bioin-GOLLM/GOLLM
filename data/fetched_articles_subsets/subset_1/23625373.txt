Hypodontia, a tooth developmental disease, can affect chewing and pronunciation. 
Mutations in the ectodysplasin-A (EDA) gene can lead to both X-linked 
hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) and non-syndromic hypodontia (NSH). 
However, the mechanism by which these 2 related but different disorders are 
caused by the distinct mutations in EDA is unknown. In this study, we identified 
a novel missense mutation (c.779 T>G) in a Chinese family with NSH via a direct 
sequencing approach. This mutation results in an Ile260Ser substitution in the 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homology domain. Homology modeling suggests that 
this alteration may induce a conformational change in the hydrophobic center of 
the TNF homology domain. Furthermore, by exploring systematic 3D conformation 
analysis and calculation of residue relative solvent accessibility (RSA) for all 
the reported mutated amino acid sites on EDA's TNF homology domain, we found 
that the site mutations at the interior may be linked to XLHED, while those at 
the surface are more likely to be associated with NSH. These findings may aid in 
the discovery of unidentified functionally significant mutation sites in the EDA 
gene and provide a new way to clarify the mechanisms by which the XLHED and NSH 
phenotypes arise from mutations in the same gene.
