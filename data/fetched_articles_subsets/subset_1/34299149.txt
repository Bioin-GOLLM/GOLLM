In the last decades, a kind of small non-coding RNA molecules, called as 
microRNAs, has been applied as negative regulators in various types of cancer 
treatment through down-regulation of their targets. More recent studies exert 
that microRNAs play a critical role in the EMT process of cancer, promoting or 
inhibiting EMT progression. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that 
pure compounds from natural plants could modulate deregulated microRNAs to 
inhibit EMT, resulting in the inhibition of cancer development. This small essay 
is on the purpose of demonstrating the significance and function of microRNAs in 
the EMT process as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes according to studies 
mainly conducted in the last four years, providing evidence of efficient target 
therapy. The review also summarizes the drug candidates with the ability to 
restrain EMT in cancer through microRNA regulation.
