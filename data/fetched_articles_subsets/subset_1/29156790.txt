In the present study, we demonstrate that Kaempferol inhibited survival and 
proliferation of established human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines 
(HepG2, Huh-7, BEL7402, and SMMC) and primary human HCC cells. Kaempferol 
treatment in HCC cells induced profound AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
activation, which led to Ulk1 phosphorylation, mTOR complex 1 inhibition and 
cell autophagy. Autophagy induction was reflected by Beclin-1/autophagy gene 5 
upregulation and p62 degradation as well as light chain 3B (LC3B)-I to LC3B-II 
conversion and LC3B puncta formation. Inhibition of AMPK, via AMPKα1 shRNA or 
dominant negative mutation, reversed above signaling changes. AMPK inhibition 
also largely inhibited Kaempferol-induced cytotoxicity in HCC cells. Autophagy 
inhibition, by 3-methyaldenine or Beclin-1 shRNA, also protected HCC cells from 
Kaempferol. Kaempferol downregulated melanoma antigen 6, the AMPK ubiquitin 
ligase, causing AMPKα1 stabilization and accumulation. We conclude that 
Kaempferol inhibits human HCC cells via activating AMPK signaling.
