Accumulation of the parkin-interacting substrate (PARIS; ZNF746), due to 
inactivation of parkin, contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) through 
repression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α 
(PGC-1α; PPARGC1A) activity. Here, we identify farnesol as an inhibitor of 
PARIS. Farnesol promoted the farnesylation of PARIS, preventing its repression 
of PGC-1α via decreasing PARIS occupancy on the PPARGC1A promoter. Farnesol 
prevented dopaminergic neuronal loss and behavioral deficits via farnesylation 
of PARIS in PARIS transgenic mice, ventral midbrain transduction of AAV-PARIS, 
adult conditional parkin KO mice, and the α-synuclein preformed fibril model of 
sporadic PD. PARIS farnesylation is decreased in the substantia nigra of 
patients with PD, suggesting that reduced farnesylation of PARIS may play a role 
in PD. Thus, farnesol may be beneficial in the treatment of PD by enhancing the 
farnesylation of PARIS and restoring PGC-1α activity.
