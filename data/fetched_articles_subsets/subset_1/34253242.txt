Recently, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) due to their pro-angiogenic, 
anti-apoptotic, and immunoregulatory competencies along with fewer ethical 
issues are presented as a rational strategy for regenerative medicine. Current 
reports have signified that the pleiotropic effects of MSCs are not related to 
their differentiation potentials, but rather are exerted through the release of 
soluble paracrine molecules. Being nano-sized, non-toxic, biocompatible, barely 
immunogenic, and owning targeting capability and organotropism, exosomes are 
considered nanocarriers for their possible use in diagnosis and therapy. 
Exosomes convey functional molecules such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 
micro-RNAs (miRNAs), proteins (e.g., chemokine and cytokine), and lipids from 
MSCs to the target cells. They participate in intercellular interaction 
procedures and enable the repair of damaged or diseased tissues and organs. 
Findings have evidenced that exosomes alone are liable for the beneficial 
influences of MSCs in a myriad of experimental models, suggesting that MSC- 
exosomes can be utilized to establish a novel cell-free therapeutic strategy for 
the treatment of varied human disorders, encompassing myocardial infarction 
(MI), CNS-related disorders, musculoskeletal disorders (e.g. arthritis), kidney 
diseases, liver diseases, lung diseases, as well as cutaneous wounds. 
Importantly, compared with MSCs, MSC- exosomes serve more steady entities and 
reduced safety risks concerning the injection of live cells, such as 
microvasculature occlusion risk. In the current review, we will discuss the 
therapeutic potential of MSC- exosomes as an innovative approach in the context 
of regenerative medicine and highlight the recent knowledge on MSC- exosomes in 
translational medicine, focusing on in vivo researches.
