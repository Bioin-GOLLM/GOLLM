BACKGROUND: Mutations involving isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH 1) occur in a 
high proportion of diffuse gliomas, with implications on diagnosis and 
prognosis. About 90% involve exon 4 at codon 132, replacing amino acid arginine 
with histidine (R132H). Rarer ones include R132C, R132S, R132G, R132L, R132V, 
and R132P. Most authors have used DNA-based methods to assess IDH1 status. 
Preliminary studies comparing imunohistochemistry (IHC) with IDH1-R132H 
mutation-specific antibodies have shown concordance with DNA sequencing and no 
cross-reactivity with wild-type IDH1 or other mutant proteins. The present study 
compares results of IHC with DNA sequencing in diffuse gliomas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty diffuse gliomas with frozen tissue samples for DNA 
sequencing and adequate tissue in paraffin blocks for IHC using IDH1-R132H 
specific antibody were assessed for IDH1 mutations.
RESULTS: Concordance of findings between IHC and DNA sequencing was noted in 88% 
(44/50) cases. All 6 cases with discrepancy were immunopositive with DIA-H09 
antibody. While in 3 of these 6 cases, DNA sequencing failed to reveal any 
mutations, R132L (arginine replaced by leucine) mutation was found in the rest 3 
cases. Interestingly, of the immunopositive cases, 46.6% (14/30) showed 
immunostaining in only a fraction of tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: IHC is an easy and quick method of detecting IDH1-R132H mutations, 
but there may be some discrepancies between IHC and DNA sequencing. Although 
there were no false-negative cases, cross-reactivity with IDH1-R132L was seen in 
3, a finding not reported thus far. Because of more universal availability of 
IHC over genetic testing, cross-reactivity and staining heterogeneity may have 
bearing over its use in detecting IDH1-R132H mutation in gliomas.
