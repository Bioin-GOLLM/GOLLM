We sought to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of the genes involved in βAR signaling with the response of patients to 
βAR blockers. A total of 2403 hospitalized patients with chronic heart failure 
(HF) were enrolled in a multicenter observational study as the first cohort and 
followed up for a mean period of 20 months. Genes for β1AR, β2AR, and the major 
cardiac G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) GRK2 and GRK5 were analyzed to 
identify SNPs, and patients were stratified according to genotypes. A second 
independent cohort enrolling 919 patients with chronic HF was applied to 
validate the observed associations. The signaling properties of the key 
identified SNPs were assessed in vitro. Our data showed that HF patients 
harboring the Gly16 allele in the gene for β2AR (ADRB2) had an increased risk of 
the composite end point relative to patients who were homozygous for Arg16. 
Notably, these patients showed a beneficial response to βAR-blocker treatment in 
a G allele-dose-dependent manner, whereas Arg16 homozygotes had no response to 
βAR-blocker therapy. This Arg16Gly genotype-dependent heterogeneity in clinical 
outcomes of HF was successfully validated in the second independent population. 
Besides, the in vitro experiments revealed that G allele carriers were defective 
in β2AR-coupled inhibitory adenylate cyclase g (Gi) protein signaling.
