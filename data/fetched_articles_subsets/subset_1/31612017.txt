Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a rare benign tumor of the central nervous 
system that is usually confined to the cerebral ventricles. According to the 
World Health Organization, CPP corresponds to a grade I atypical CPP (a-CPP); 
however, it can become more aggressive and reach grade II, which can rarely 
undergo malignant transformation into a choroid plexus carcinoma (grade III). To 
the best of our knowledge, identification of these tumors mutations by next 
generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has not been yet reported. In the present study, 
NGS analysis of an a-CPP case was performed. Data were analyzed using Advaita 
Bioinformatics i-VariantGuide and Ion Reporter 5.6 programs. The results from 
NGS identified 12 novel missense mutations in the following genes: NOTCH1, ATM, 
STK36, MAGI1, DST, RECQL4, NUMA1, THBS1, MYH11, MALT1, SMARCA4 and CDH20. The 
PolyPhen score of six variants viz., DST, RECQL4, NUMA1, THBS1, MYHI1 and 
SMARCA4 were high, which suggested these variants represents pathogenic 
variants. Two novel insertions that caused frameshift were also found. 
Furthermore, two novel nonsense mutations and 14 novel intronic variants were 
identified in this tumor. The novel missense mutation detected in ATM gene was 
situated in c.5808A>T; p. (Leu1936Phe) in exon 39, and a known ATM mutation was 
in c.5948A>G; p. (Asn1983Ser). These novel mutations had not been reported in 
previous database. Subsequently, the quality statistics of these variants, 
including allele coverage, allele ratio, P-value, Phred quality score, 
sequencing coverage, PolyPhen score and alleles frequency was performed. For all 
variants, P-value was highly significant and the Phred quality score was high. 
In addition, the results from sequencing coverage demonstrated that 97.02% reads 
were on target and that 97.88% amplicons had at least 500 reads. These findings 
may serve at determining new strategies to distinguish the types of choroid 
plexus tumor, and at developing novel targeted therapies. Development of NGS 
technologies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia may be used in molecular pathology 
laboratories.
