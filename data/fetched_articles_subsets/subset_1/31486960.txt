BACKGROUND: The term "intramuscular hemangioma capillary type" (IHCT) refers to 
a fast-flow vascular lesion that is classified as a tumor, although its 
phenotype overlaps with arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The purpose of this 
study was to identify somatic mutations in IHCT.
METHODS: Affected tissue specimens were obtained during a clinically indicated 
procedure. The diagnosis of IHCT was based on history, physical examination, 
imaging and histopathology. Because somatic mutations in cancer-associated genes 
can cause vascular malformations, we sequenced exons from 446 cancer-related 
genes in DNA from 7 IHCT specimens. We then performed mutation-specific droplet 
digital PCR (ddPCR) to independently test for the presence of a somatic mutation 
found by sequencing and to screen one additional IHCT sample.
RESULTS: We detected somatic mutations in 6 of 8 IHCT specimens. Four specimens 
had a mutation in MAP2K1 (p.Q58_E62del, p.P105_I107delinsL, p.Q56P) and 2 
specimens had mutations in KRAS (p.K5E and p.G12D, p.G12D and p.Q22R). Mutant 
allele frequencies detected by sequencing and confirmed by ddPCR ranged from 2 
to 15%.
CONCLUSIONS: IHCT lesions are phenotypically similar to AVMs and contain the 
same somatic MAP2K1 or KRAS mutations, suggesting that IHCT is on the AVM 
spectrum. We propose calling this lesion "intramuscular fast-flow vascular 
anomaly."
