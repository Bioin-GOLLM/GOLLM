In order to explore the possible role of E-cadherin in familial cancer, 19 
familial breast cancer patients, whose tumours demonstrated loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) at the E-cadherin locus, were screened for germline 
mutations. No pathogenic germline alterations were detected in these 
individuals. However, a somatic mutation was found (49-2A-->C) in one of the 
tumours. This tumour showed a pattern of both ductal and lobular histology. 
Another 10 families with cases of breast, gastric and colon cancer were also 
screened for germline mutations, and no mutations were found. A missense 
mutation in exon 12 of E-cadherin (1774G-->A; Ala592Thr) was previously found in 
one family with diffuse gastric cancer, and colon and breast cancer. An allelic 
association study was performed to determine whether the Ala592Thr alteration 
predisposes to breast cancer. In total, we studied 484 familial breast cancer 
patients, 614 sporadic breast cancer patients and 497 control individuals. The 
frequencies of this alteration were similar in these groups. However, a 
correlation between the Ala592Thr alteration and ductal comedo-type tumour was 
seen. These results, together with previously reported studies, indicate that 
germline mutations and, more commonly, somatic mutations in E-cadherin may have 
an influence on the behaviour of the tumours, rather than predispose to breast 
cancer.
