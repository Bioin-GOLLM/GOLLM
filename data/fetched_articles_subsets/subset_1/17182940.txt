The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of functional polymorphisms 
in promoters of the MMP-2 (-1306 C > T), MMP-3 (-1171 5A > 6A), MMP-9 (-1562 C > 
T), MMP-12 (-82 A > G), TIMP-1 (-372 C > T), and PAI-1 (-675 4G > 5G and -847 A 
> G) genes on the growth rate of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. The patients 
with small aneurysms were recruited from the surveillance arm of the U.K. Small 
Aneurysm Trial and monitored for aneurysm growth, mean follow-up 2.6 years. Mean 
linear aneurysm growth rates were calculated by flexible modeling. For MMP-2, 
MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-12, and TIMP-1 polymorphisms there were no clear associations 
with aneurysm growth. The increased growth rates for patients of 5G5G PAI-1 
genotype were of borderline significance (P = 0.06). However, PAI-1 haplotype 
analysis showed that 5G5G/GG patients had significantly faster aneurysm growth 
(mean 0.46 mm/year faster). There was no evidence that any specific MMP 
polymorphism had a clinically significant effect on aneurysm growth. However the 
plasminogen system (via PAI-1) appears to have a small, but clinically 
significant, role in aneurysm growth.
