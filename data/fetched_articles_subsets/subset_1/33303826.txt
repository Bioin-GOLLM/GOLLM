5-HT2A, a G-protein coupled receptor, is widely expressed in the human body, 
including in the gastrointestinal tract, platelets and the nervous system. It 
mediates various functions, for e.g. learning, memory, mood regulation, platelet 
aggregation and vasoconstriction, but its involvement in cell-adhesion remains 
largely unknown. Here we report a novel role for 5-HT2A in cell-matrix 
adhesion.In HEK293 cells, which are loosely adherent, expression and stimulation 
of human or rat 5-HT2A receptor by agonists such as serotonin or 
2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) led to a significant increase in adhesion, 
while inhibition of 5-HT2A by antipsychotics, such as risperidone, olanzapine or 
chlorpromazine prevented it. 5-HT2A activation gave rise to stress fibers in 
these cells and was also required for their maintenance. Mechanistically, the 
5-HT2A-mediated adhesion was mediated by downstream PKC and Rho signaling. Since 
5-HT2A is associated with many disorders such as dementia, depression and 
schizophrenia, its role in cell-matrix adhesion could have implications for 
neural circuits.
