Some colorectal cancer patients harboring FGFR (fibroblast growth factor 
receptor) genetic alterations, such as copy number gain, mutation, and/or mRNA 
overexpression, were selected for enrollment in several recent clinical trials 
of FGFR inhibitor, because these genetic alterations were preclinically reported 
to be associated with FGFR inhibitor sensitivity as well as poor prognosis, 
invasiveness, and/or metastatic potential. However, few enrolled patients were 
responsive to FGFR inhibitors. Thus, practical strategies are eagerly awaited 
that can stratify patients for the subset that potentially responds to FGFR 
inhibitor chemotherapy. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity to 
FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib on 25 patient-derived tumor-initiating cell (TIC) 
spheroid lines carrying wild-type RAS and RAF genes, both in vitro and in vivo. 
Then, we assessed possible correlations between the sensitivity and the 
genetic/genomic data of the spheroid lines tested. Upon their exposure to 
erdafitinib, seven lines (7/25, 28%) responded significantly. Normal colonic 
epithelial stem cells were unaffected by the inhibitors. Moreover, the 
combination of erdafitinib with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib showed stronger growth 
inhibition than either drug alone, as efficacy was observed in 21 lines (84%) 
including 14 (56%) that were insensitive to erdafitinib alone. The in vitro 
erdafitinib response was accurately reflected on mouse xenografts of TIC 
spheroid lines. However, we found little correlation between their 
genetic/genomic alterations of TIC spheroids and the sensitivity to the FGFR 
inhibitor. Accordingly, we propose that direct testing of the patient-derived 
spheroids in vitro is one of the most reliable personalized methods in 
FGFR-inhibitor therapy of colorectal cancer patients.
