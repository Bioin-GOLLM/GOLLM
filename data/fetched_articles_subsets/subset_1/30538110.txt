PURPOSE: Microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase 1 (mPGES1) was evaluated as an 
important downstream effector of the COX2 pathway responsible for tumor-mediated 
immunosuppression in melanoma.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The analysis of a stage III melanoma tissue microarray (n = 
91) was performed to assess the association between mPGES1, COX2, CD8, and 
patient survival. Pharmacologic inhibitors and syngeneic mouse models using 
PTGES-knockout (KO) mouse melanoma cell lines were used to evaluate the 
mPGES1-mediated immunosuppressive function.
RESULTS: We observed correlations in expression and colocalization of COX2 and 
mPGES1, which are associated with increased expression of immunosuppressive 
markers in human melanoma. In a syngeneic melanoma mouse model, PTGES KO 
increased melanoma expression of PD-L1, increased infiltration of CD8a+ T cells, 
and CD8a+ dendritic cells into tumors and suppressed tumor growth. Durable tumor 
regression was observed in mice bearing PTGES KO tumors that were given 
anti-PD-1 therapy. Analysis of a stage III melanoma tissue microarray revealed 
significant associations between high mPGES1 expression and low CD8+ 
infiltration, which correlated with a shorter patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are the first to illustrate a potential role for mPGES1 
inhibition in melanoma immune evasion and selective targeting in supporting the 
durability of response to PD-1 checkpoint immunotherapy. More research effort in 
this drug development space is needed to validate the use of mPGES1 inhibitors 
as safe treatment options.
