Synapse loss strongly correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Deficient Wnt 
signaling contributes to synapse dysfunction and loss in AD. Consistently, a 
variant of the LRP6 receptor, (LRP6-Val), with reduced Wnt signaling, is linked 
to late-onset AD. However, the impact of LRP6-Val on the healthy and AD brain 
has not been examined. Knock-in mice, generated by gene editing, carrying this 
Lrp6 variant develop normally. However, neurons from Lrp6-val mice do not 
respond to Wnt7a, a ligand that promotes synaptic assembly through the 
Frizzled-5 receptor. Wnt7a stimulates the formation of the low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6)-Frizzled-5 complex but not if 
LRP6-Val is present. Lrp6-val mice exhibit structural and functional synaptic 
defects that become pronounced with age. Lrp6-val mice present exacerbated 
synapse loss around plaques when crossed to the NL-G-F AD model. Our findings 
uncover a previously unidentified role for Lrp6-val in synapse vulnerability 
during aging and AD.
