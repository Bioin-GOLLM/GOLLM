Coronary artery disease (CAD) and its main complication myocardial infarction 
are the leading causes of death globally. Environmental factors don't explain 
the large amount of variance seen in the development of the disease. Given the 
strong heritability of CAD, some of the unexplained variance may be due to 
genetic factors. In this issue of the Journal, Jiang and colleagues report a 
strong association between brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met 
polymorphism and CAD. There is increasing evidence that BDNF is not only 
involved in neuronal development but also energy expenditure. The results of 
this study are likely to give further impetus to researching the complex 
mechanisms and crosstalk that contribute to the pathogenesis of various 
polygenic disorders.
