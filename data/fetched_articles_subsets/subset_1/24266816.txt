AIM: Serum PSA screening for prostate cancer (PCa) is controversial. Here, we 
identify three urinary biomarkers - aHGF, IGFBP3 and OPN - for PCa screening and 
prognostication.
METHODS: Urinary aHGF, OPN and IGFBP3 from healthy men (n = 19) and men with 
localized (n = 65) and metastatic (n = 36) PCa were quantified via ELISA. 
Mann-Whitney nonparametric t-test and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of 
Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analyses were used to analyze associations.
RESULTS: Mean aHGF and IGFBP3 levels were significantly elevated in PCa patients 
versus controls (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.0012, respectively), and the area under 
the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (indicator of 
diagnostic accuracy) for aHGF and IGFBP3 was 0.75 and 0.74, respectively. OPN 
levels were significantly higher in metastatic groups (p = 0.0060) versus 
localized and controls (area under the curve = 0.68).
CONCLUSION: Urinary aHGF and IGFBP3 exhibit the capacity for diagnostic 
discrimination for PCa, whereas OPN may indicate presence of metastatic disease.
