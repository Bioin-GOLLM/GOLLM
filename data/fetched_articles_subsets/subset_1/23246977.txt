AIMS: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common female endocrine disorder, 
represents a wide range of clinical manifestations and disease severity. Recent 
studies suggest an association between gene variants involved in vitamin D 
metabolism and common metabolic disturbances in PCOS. We aimed to examine the 
association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene variant with PCOS susceptibility 
and the severity of disease phenotype.
METHODS: All participants, including 260 PCOS women (cases) and 221 
normoovulatory women (controls), were recruited from a reproductive 
endocrinology clinic. Cases were divided into the severe and mild PCOS phenotype 
groups, based on their clinical and paraclinical features. An adenosine to 
guanine single nucleotide polymorphism of VDR gene (rs757343) was genotyped 
using the PCR-RFLP method.
RESULTS: Distributions of genotypes and alleles did not differ between cases and 
controls, indicating that this SNP is not associated with increased risk for 
PCOS. However, this SNP was found to be associated with the severity of the PCOS 
phenotype. In particular, presence of the A allele is associated with a 74% 
increased risk of severe phenotype development (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.07-2.82).
CONCLUSION: The genetic variant of the VDR was found to have an association with 
severity of clinical features of PCOS, but none with disease risk.
