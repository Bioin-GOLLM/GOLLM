Exocytosis is the process by which secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma 
membrane to deliver materials to the cell surface or to release cargoes to the 
extracellular space. The exocyst-an evolutionarily conserved octameric protein 
complex-mediates spatiotemporal control of SNARE complex assembly for vesicle 
fusion and tethering the secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. The exocyst 
participates in diverse cellular functions, including protein trafficking to the 
plasma membrane, membrane extension, cell polarity, neurite outgrowth, 
ciliogenesis, cytokinesis, cell migration, autophagy, host defense, and 
tumorigenesis. Exocyst subunits are essential for cell viability; and mutations 
or variants in several exocyst subunits have been implicated in human diseases, 
mostly neurodevelopmental disorders and ciliopathies. These conditions often 
share common features such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and 
brain abnormalities. In this review, we summarize the mutations and variants in 
exocyst subunits that have been linked to disease and discuss the implications 
of exocyst dysfunction in other disorders.
