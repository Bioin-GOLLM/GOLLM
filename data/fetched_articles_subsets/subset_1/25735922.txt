Small molecules targeting the enzymes responsible for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) maturation, DNA synthesis and its subsequent chromosomal integration 
as ribonucleotide-free double-stranded DNA remain the mainstay of combination 
antiretroviral therapy. For infected individuals harboring drug-susceptible 
virus, this approach has afforded complete or near-complete viral suppression. 
However, in the absence of a curative strategy, the predictable emergence of 
drug-resistant variants requires continued development of improved antiviral 
strategies, inherent to which is the necessity of identifying novel targets. 
Regulatory elementsRegulatory elements that mediate transcription, translation, 
nucleocytoplasmic transport, dimerization, packaging and reverse transcription 
of the (+) strand RNA genomeRNA genome should now be considered viable targets 
for small molecule, peptide- and oligonucleotide-based therapeuticsTherapeutics 
. Where target specificity and cellular penetration and toxicity have been the 
primary obstacle to successful "macromolecule therapeutics", this chapter 
summarizes (a) novel approaches targeting RNA motifs whose three-dimensional 
structure is critical for biological function and consequently may be less prone 
to resistance-conferring mutations and (b) improved methods for deliveryDelivery
