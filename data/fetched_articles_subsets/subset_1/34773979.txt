BACKGROUND: We benchmarked sequencing technology and assembly strategies for 
short-read, long-read, and hybrid assemblers in respect to correctness, 
contiguity, and completeness of assemblies in genomes of Francisella tularensis. 
Benchmarking allowed in-depth analyses of genomic structures of the Francisella 
pathogenicity islands and insertion sequences. Five major high-throughput 
sequencing technologies were applied, including next-generation "short-read" and 
third-generation "long-read" sequencing methods.
RESULTS: We focused on short-read assemblers, hybrid assemblers, and analysis of 
the genomic structure with particular emphasis on insertion sequences and the 
Francisella pathogenicity island. The A5-miseq pipeline performed best for MiSeq 
data, Mira for Ion Torrent data, and ABySS for HiSeq data from eight short-read 
assembly methods. Two approaches were applied to benchmark long-read and hybrid 
assembly strategies: long-read-first assembly followed by correction with short 
reads (Canu/Pilon, Flye/Pilon) and short-read-first assembly along with 
scaffolding based on long reads (Unicyler, SPAdes). Hybrid assembly can resolve 
large repetitive regions best with a "long-read first" approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Genomic structures of the Francisella pathogenicity islands 
frequently showed misassembly. Insertion sequences (IS) could be used to perform 
an evolutionary conservation analysis. A phylogenetic structure of insertion 
sequences and the evolution within the clades elucidated the clade structure of 
the highly conservative F. tularensis.
