Using the zebrafish neural tube as a model, we uncover the in vivo mechanisms 
allowing the generation of two opposing apical epithelial surfaces within the 
centre of an initially unpolarised, solid organ. We show that Mpp5a and Rab11a 
play a dual role in coordinating the generation of ipsilateral junctional belts 
whilst simultaneously releasing contralateral adhesions across the centre of the 
tissue. We show that Mpp5a- and Rab11a-mediated resolution of cell-cell 
adhesions are both necessary for midline lumen opening and contribute to later 
maintenance of epithelial organisation. We propose that these roles for both 
Mpp5a and Rab11a operate through the transmembrane protein Crumbs. In light of a 
recent conflicting publication, we also clarify that the junction-remodelling 
role of Mpp5a is not specific to dividing cells.
