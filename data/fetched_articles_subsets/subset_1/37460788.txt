Aversion refers to feelings of strong dislike or avoidance toward particular 
stimuli or situations. Aversion can be caused by pain stimuli and has a 
long-term negative impact on physical and mental health. Aversion can also be 
caused by drug abuse withdrawal, resulting in people with substance use disorder 
to relapse. However, the mechanisms underlying aversion remain unclear. The 
ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is considered to play a key role in 
aversive behavior. Our study showed that inhibition of vlPAG GABAergic neurons 
significantly attenuated the conditioned place aversion (CPA) induced by hindpaw 
pain pinch or naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. However, activating or 
inhibiting glutamatergic neurons, or activating GABAergic neurons cannot affect 
or alter CPA response. AKAP150 protein expression and phosphorylated TRPV1 
(p-TRPV1) were significantly upregulated in these two CPA models. In 
AKAP150flox/flox mice and C57/B6J wild-type mice, cell-type-selective inhibition 
of AKAP150 in GABAergic neurons in the vlPAG attenuated aversion. However, 
downregulating AKAP150 in glutamatergic neurons did not attenuate aversion. 
Knockdown of AKAP150 in GABAergic neurons effectively reversed the p-TRPV1 
upregulation in these two CPA models utilized in our study. Collectively, 
inhibition of the AKAP150/p-TRPV1 pathway in GABAergic neurons in the vlPAG may 
be considered a potential therapeutic target for the CPA response.
