BACKGROUND: Bedaquiline is a core drug for treatment of rifampicin-resistant 
tuberculosis. Few genomic variants have been statistically associated with 
bedaquiline resistance. Alternative approaches for determining the 
genotypic-phenotypic association are needed to guide clinical care.
METHODS: Using published phenotype data for variants in Rv0678, atpE, pepQ and 
Rv1979c genes in 756 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and survey data of the 
opinion of 33 experts, we applied Bayesian methods to estimate the posterior 
probability of bedaquiline resistance and corresponding 95% credible intervals.
RESULTS: Experts agreed on the role of Rv0678, and atpE, were uncertain about 
the role of pepQ and Rv1979c variants and overestimated the probability of 
bedaquiline resistance for most variant types, resulting in lower posterior 
probabilities compared to prior estimates. The posterior median probability of 
bedaquiline resistance was low for synonymous mutations in atpE (0.1%) and 
Rv0678 (3.3%), high for missense mutations in atpE (60.8%) and nonsense 
mutations in Rv0678 (55.1%), relatively low for missense (31.5%) mutations and 
frameshift (30.0%) in Rv0678 and low for missense mutations in pepQ (2.6%) and 
Rv1979c (2.9%), but 95% credible intervals were wide.
CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian probability estimates of bedaquiline resistance given the 
presence of a specific mutation could be useful for clinical decision-making as 
it presents interpretable probabilities compared to standard odds ratios. For a 
newly emerging variant, the probability of resistance for the variant type and 
gene can still be used to guide clinical decision-making. Future studies should 
investigate the feasibility of using Bayesian probabilities for bedaquiline 
resistance in clinical practice.
