BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of opicapone, a once-daily 
catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, have been established in two large 
randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational pivotal trials. Still, clinical 
evidence from routine practice is needed to complement the data from the pivotal 
trials.
METHODS: OPTIPARK (NCT02847442) was a prospective, open-label, single-arm trial 
conducted in Germany and the UK under clinical practice conditions. Patients 
with Parkinson's disease and motor fluctuations were treated with opicapone 
50 mg for 3 (Germany) or 6 (UK) months in addition to their current levodopa and 
other antiparkinsonian treatments. The primary endpoint was the Clinician's 
Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) after 3 months. Secondary assessments 
included Patient Global Impressions of Change (PGI-C), the Unified Parkinson's 
Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), and the 
Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Safety assessments included evaluation of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).
RESULTS: Of the 506 patients enrolled, 495 (97.8%) took at least one dose of 
opicapone. Of these, 393 (79.4%) patients completed 3 months of treatment. 
Overall, 71.3 and 76.9% of patients experienced any improvement on CGI-C and 
PGI-C after 3 months, respectively (full analysis set). At 6 months, for UK 
subgroup only (n = 95), 85.3% of patients were judged by investigators as 
improved since commencing treatment. UPDRS scores at 3 months showed 
statistically significant improvements in activities of daily living during OFF 
(mean ± SD change from baseline: - 3.0 ± 4.6, p < 0.0001) and motor scores 
during ON (- 4.6 ± 8.1, p < 0.0001). The mean ± SD improvements of - 3.4 ± 12.8 
points for PDQ-8 and -6.8 ± 19.7 points for NMSS were statistically significant 
versus baseline (both p < 0.0001). Most of TEAEs (94.8% of events) were of mild 
or moderate intensity. TEAEs considered to be at least possibly related to 
opicapone were reported for 45.1% of patients, with dyskinesia (11.5%) and dry 
mouth (6.5%) being the most frequently reported. Serious TEAEs considered at 
least possibly related to opicapone were reported for 1.4% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone 50 mg was effective and generally well-tolerated in PD 
patients with motor fluctuations treated in clinical practice.
