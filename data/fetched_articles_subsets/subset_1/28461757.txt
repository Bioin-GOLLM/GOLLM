PURPOSE: Recent studies demonstrate the possible antitumor effects of 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); however, the exact 
mechanism is still unclear. The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of 
GM-CSF on multiple biological functions of human esophageal cancer (EC) cell 
lines and to explore the potential mechanism of its antitumor effects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eca109/9706 human EC cells were examined. Cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were analyzed using cell proliferation 
assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assay, respectively. The expression of 
signaling molecules were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction and Western blot.
RESULTS: Our results provide experimental evidence that GM-CSF inhibits growth 
and migration, as well as induction of apoptosis in EC cells. In addition, EC 
cells stimulated with GM-CSF were more likely to have suppressed 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), accompanied by increased E-cadherin 
and decreased vimentin expression.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that GM-CSF inhibits cancer cell proliferation 
and migration, as well as induction of apoptosis. Moreover, our findings 
indicate that GM-CSF may regulate EMT through JAK2-PRMT5 signaling, and thereby 
exhibit its antitumor effects on EC cells.
