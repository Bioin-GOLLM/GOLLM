This research aimed to evaluate the effects of high-dose cholecalciferol (VD3) 
supplements (50,000 IU/week) on selected circulating cytokines associated with 
cytokine storms in adults with vitamin D deficiency. This clinical trial, based 
in Jordan, included 50 participants receiving vitamin D3 supplements (50,000 
IU/week) for 8 weeks; the exact number was assigned to the control group. 
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor 
necrotic factor-α (TNF-α), and leptin were measured in serum at baseline and 10 
weeks (wash out: 2 weeks). Our results revealed that vitamin D3 supplementation 
significantly increased the serum levels of 25OHD, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β, and 
leptin compared with baseline. In contrast, the serum level of TNF-α 
insignificantly increased in the group receiving vitamin D3 supplementation. 
Although the observations of this trial may refer to a potential negative effect 
of VD3 supplementation during cytokine storms, further trials are required to 
clarify the potential benefits of VD3 supplement during cytokine storms.
