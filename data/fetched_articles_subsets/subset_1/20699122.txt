The analysis of the spatial patterning of mRNA expression is critically 
important for assigning functional and physiological significance to a given 
gene product. Given the tens of thousands of mRNAs in the mammalian genome, a 
full assessment of individual gene functions would ideally be overlaid upon 
knowledge of the specific cell types expressing each mRNA. In situ hybridization 
approaches represent a molecular biological/histological method that can reveal 
cellular patterns of mRNA expression. Here, we present detailed procedures for 
the detection of specific mRNAs using radioactive RNA probes in tissue sections 
followed by autoradiographic detection. These methods allow for the specific and 
sensitive detection of spatial patterns of mRNA expression, thereby linking mRNA 
expression with cell type and function. Radioactive detection methods also 
facilitate semi-quantitative analyses of changes in mRNA gene expression.
