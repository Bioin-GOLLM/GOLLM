Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is known to influence various cellular 
functions, including cell cycle progression. Although it is well known how ER 
stress inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase, the molecular mechanism 
underlying how ER stress induces G2/M cell cycle arrest remains largely unknown. 
In this study, we found that ER stress and subsequent induction of the UPR led 
to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by reducing the amount of cyclin B1. 
Pharmacological inhibition of the IRE1α or ATF6α signaling did not affect ER 
stress-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. However, when the alpha 
subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) phosphorylation 
was genetically abrogated, the cell cycle progressed without arresting at the 
G2/M phase after ER stress. GEO database analysis showed that growth arrest and 
DNA-damage-inducible protein α (Gadd45α) were induced in an eIF2a 
phosphorylation-dependent manner, which was confirmed in this study. Knockdown 
of GADD45α abrogated cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase upon ER stress. 
Finally, the cell death caused by ER stress significantly reduced when GADD45α 
expression was knocked down. In conclusion, GADD45α is a key mediator of ER 
stress-induced growth arrest via regulation of the G2/M transition and cell 
death through the eIF2α signaling pathway.
