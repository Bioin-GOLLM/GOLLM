OBJECTIVE: Vascular calcification is the consequence of the complex interaction 
between genetic, environmental, and vascular factors, which ultimately lead to 
the deposition of calcium in the tunica intima (atherosclerotic calcification) 
or tunica media (Mönckenberg's sclerosis). Vascular calcification is also 
closely related to other pathologies, such as diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, 
and chronic kidney disease. It has been concluded that the degree of vascular 
calcification may vary from person to person, even if the associated pathologies 
and environmental factors are the same. Therefore, this suggests an important 
genetic contribution to the development of vascular calcification. This review 
aimed to find the most recent evidence about vascular calcification 
pathophysiology regarding the genetic aspects and molecular pathways.
DATA SOURCES: We conducted an exhaustive search in Scopus, EBSCO, and PubMed 
with the keywords "genetics and vascular calcification", "molecular pathways, 
genetic and vascular calcification" and included the main articles from January 
1995 up to August 2016. We focused on the most recent evidence about vascular 
calcification pathophysiology regarding the genetic aspects and molecular 
pathways.
STUDY SELECTION: The most valuable published original and review articles 
related to our objective were selected.
RESULTS: Vascular calcification is a multifactorial disease; thus, its 
pathophysiology cannot be explained by a single specific factor, rather than by 
the result of the association of several genetic variants, molecular pathway 
interactions, and environmental factors that promote its development.
CONCLUSION: Although several molecular aspects of this mechanism have been 
elucidated, there is still a need for a better understanding of the factors that 
predispose to this disease.
