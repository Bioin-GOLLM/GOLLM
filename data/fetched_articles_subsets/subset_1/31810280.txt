Development of tools for direct thrombus imaging represents a key step for 
diagnosis and treatment of stroke. Nanoliposomal carriers of contrast agents and 
thrombolytics can be functionalized to target blood thrombi by small protein 
binders with selectivity for fibrin domains uniquely formed on insoluble fibrin. 
We employed a highly complex combinatorial library derived from scaffold of 46 
amino acid albumin-binding domain (ABD) of streptococcal protein G, and ribosome 
display, to identify variants recognizing fibrin cloth in human thrombus. We 
constructed a recombinant target as a stretch of three identical fibrin 
fragments of 16 amino acid peptide of the Bβ chain fused to TolA protein. 
Ribosome display selection followed by large-scale Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent 
Assay (ELISA) screening provided four protein variants preferentially binding to 
insoluble form of human fibrin. The most specific binder variant D7 was further 
modified by C-terminal FLAG/His-Tag or double His-tag for the attachment onto 
the surface of nanoliposomes via metallochelating bond. D7-His-nanoliposomes 
were tested using in vitro flow model of coronary artery and their binding to 
fibrin fibers was demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy. Thus, we 
present here the concept of fibrin-targeted binders as a platform for 
functionalization of nanoliposomes in the development of advanced imaging tools 
and future theranostics.
