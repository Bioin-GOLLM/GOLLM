Numerous biomarkers have been unveiled in the rapidly evolving biomarker 
discovery field, with an aim to improve the clinical management of disorders. In 
rare diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, this endeavor has created a 
wealth of knowledge that, if effectively exploited, will benefit affected 
individuals, with respect to health care, therapy, improved quality of life and 
increased life expectancy. The most promising findings and molecular biomarkers 
are inspected in this review, with an aim to provide an overview of currently 
known biomarkers and the technological developments used. Biomarkers as cells, 
genetic variations, miRNAs, proteins, lipids and/or metabolites indicative of 
disease severity, progression and treatment response have the potential to 
improve development and approval of therapies, clinical management of DMD and 
patients' life quality. We highlight the complexity of translating research 
results to clinical use, emphasizing the need for biomarkers, fit for purpose 
and describe the challenges associated with qualifying biomarkers for clinical 
applications.
