Glycans play diverse roles in a wide range of biological processes. Research on 
glycan-binding events is essential for learning their biological and 
pathological functions. However, the functions of terminal and internal glycan 
epitopes exhibited during binding with glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) and/or 
viruses need to be further identified. Therefore, a focused library of 36 
biantennary asparagine (Asn)-linked glycans with some presenting tandem glycan 
epitopes was synthesized via a combined Core Isolation/Enzymatic Extension 
(CIEE) and one-pot multienzyme (OPME) synthetic strategy. These N-glycans 
include those containing a terminal sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), sialyl 
Lewis x (sLex) and Siaα2-8-Siaα2-3/6-R structures with N-acetylneuraminic acid 
(Neu5Ac) or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) sialic acid form, LacNAc, Lewis x 
(Lex), α-Gal, and Galα1-3-Lex; and tandem epitopes including α-Gal, Lex, 
Galα1-3-Lex, LacNAc, and sialyl LacNAc, presented with an internal sialyl LacNAc 
or 1-2 repeats of an internal LacNAc or Lex component. They were synthesized in 
milligram-scale, purified to over 98% purity, and used to prepare a glycan 
microarray. Binding studies using selected plant lectins, antibodies, and 
viruses demonstrated, for the first time, that when interpreting the binding 
between glycans and GBPs/viruses, not only the structure of the terminal glycan 
epitopes, but also the internal epitopes and/or modifications of terminal 
epitopes needs to be taken into account.
