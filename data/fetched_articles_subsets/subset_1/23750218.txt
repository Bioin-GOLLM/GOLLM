Alus are the most abundant and successful short interspersed nuclear elements 
found in primate genomes. In humans, they represent about 10% of the genome, 
although few are retrotransposition-competent and are clustered into subfamilies 
according to the source gene from which they evolved. Recombination between them 
can lead to genomic rearrangements of clinical and evolutionary significance. In 
this study, we have addressed the role of recombination in the origin of 
chimeric Alu source genes by the analysis of all known consensus sequences of 
human Alus. From the allelic diversity of Alu consensus sequences, validated in 
extant elements resulting from whole genome searches, distinct events of 
recombination were detected in the origin of particular subfamilies of AluS and 
AluY source genes. These results demonstrate that at least two subfamilies are 
likely to have emerged from ectopic Alu-Alu recombination, which stimulates 
further research regarding the potential of chimeric active Alus to punctuate 
the genome.
