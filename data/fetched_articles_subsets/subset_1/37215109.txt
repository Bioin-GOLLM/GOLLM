Liver cancer is an aggressive tumor originating in the liver with a dismal 
prognosis. Current evidence suggests that liver cancer is the fifth most 
prevalent cancer worldwide and the second most deadly type of malignancy. Tumor 
heterogeneity accounts for the differences in drug responses among patients, 
emphasizing the importance of precision medicine. Patient-derived models of 
cancer are widely used preclinical models to study precision medicine since they 
preserve tumor heterogeneity ex vivo in the study of many cancers. 
Patient-derived models preserving cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions better 
recapitulate in vivo conditions, including patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), precision-cut liver slices (PCLSs), 
patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and patient-derived tumor spheroids (PDTSs). 
In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the different modalities 
used to establish preclinical models for precision medicine in liver cancer.
