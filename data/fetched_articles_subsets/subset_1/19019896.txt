BACKGROUND: The aetiology of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) remains unclear. 
Inflammation progresses to fibrosis and calcification of the spine and 
sacroiliac joints in AS development. Fibrosis results from excessive 
accumulations of the extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM turnover depends on the 
balance between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors 
(TIMPs).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of the MMP-3 -1171 and TIMP-1 372 T>C 
polymorphisms on the modified risk of AS.
METHODS: Genotypes of 241 patients with AS and 241 controls were identified by 
PCR. Disease activity and functional status were assessed by the Bath Ankylosing 
Spondylitis Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional 
Index (BASFI) and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Global (BAS-G) Score.
RESULTS: MMP-3 6A/6A carriers had a 2.41-fold (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.55 
to 3.74) increased risk of AS compared with 6A/5A and 5A/5A carriers. TIMP-1 C 
alleles had a greater risk of AS, but this was not significant (odds ratio (OR) 
= 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.77). Pairwise analysis of the MMP-3/TIMP-1 alleles 
showed that 6A/C (OR = 3.23, 95% CI 1.50 to 6.95) and 6A/T (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 
1.17 to 5.54) had a significantly greater risk of AS than the 5A/T alleles. 
After adjustment for the effects of age, gender and disease duration, the 
MMP-3/TIMP-1 5A/T alleles had the lowest BASDAI (p = 0.02), BASFI (p = 0.05) and 
BAS-G (p = 0.02) among all MMP-3/TIMP-1 alleles.
CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the importance of the MMP-3 and TIMP-1 genes 
as crucial elements in AS development.
