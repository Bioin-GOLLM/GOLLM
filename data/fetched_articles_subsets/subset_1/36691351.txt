Loss-of-function mutations of FIG4 are responsible for neurological disorders in 
human and mouse that result from reduced abundance of the signaling lipid 
PI(3,5)P2. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations of the phosphoinositide 
kinase PIP4K2C result in elevated abundance of PI(3,5)P2. These opposing effects 
on PI(3,5)P2 suggested that we might be able to compensate for deficiency of 
FIG4 by reducing expression of PIP4K2C. To test this hypothesis in a whole 
animal model, we generated triallelic mice with genotype Fig 4-/-, Pip4k2c+/-; 
these mice are null for Fig 4 and haploinsufficient for Pip4k2c. The neonatal 
lethality of Fig 4 null mice in the C57BL/6J strain background was rescued by 
reduced expression of Pip4k2c. The lysosome enlargement characteristic of Fig 4 
null cells was also reduced by heterozygous loss of Pip4k2c. The data 
demonstrate interaction between these two genes, and suggest that inhibition of 
the kinase PIPK4C2 could be a target for treatment of FIG4 deficiency disorders 
such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 4J and Yunis-Varón Syndrome.
