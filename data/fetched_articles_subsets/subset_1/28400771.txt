Irrespective of various efforts, malaria persist the most debilitating effect in 
terms of morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the existing drugs are also 
vulnerable to the emergence of drug resistance. To explore the potential targets 
for designing the most effective antimalarial therapies, it is required to focus 
on the facts of biochemical mechanism underlying the process of parasite 
survival and disease pathogenesis. This review is intended to bring out the 
existing knowledge about the functions and components of the major signaling 
pathways such as kinase signaling, calcium signaling, and cyclic 
nucleotide-based signaling, serving the various aspects of the parasitic asexual 
stage and highlighted the Toll-like receptors, 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling, and molecular events in 
cytoadhesion, which elicit the host immune response. This discussion will 
facilitate a look over essential components for parasite survival and disease 
progression to be implemented in discovery of novel antimalarial drugs and 
vaccines.
