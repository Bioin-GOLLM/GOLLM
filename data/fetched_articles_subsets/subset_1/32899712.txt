Cardiomyopathies (CMPs) represent a diverse group of heart muscle diseases, 
grouped into specific morphological and functional phenotypes. CMPs are 
associated with mutations in sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric genes, with several 
suspected epigenetic and environmental mechanisms involved in determining 
penetrance and expressivity. The understanding of the underlying molecular 
mechanisms of myocardial diseases is fundamental to achieving a proper 
management and treatment of these disorders. Among these, inflammation seems to 
play an important role in the pathogenesis of CMPs. The aim of the present study 
is to review the current knowledge on the role of inflammation and the immune 
system activation in the pathogenesis of CMPs and to identify potential 
molecular targets for a tailored anti-inflammatory treatment.
