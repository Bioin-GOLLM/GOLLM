It is estimated that the total annual financial cost for pain management in the 
U.S. exceeds 100 billion dollars. However, when indirect costs are included, 
such as functional disability and reduction in working hours, the cost can reach 
more than 300 billion dollars. In chronic pain patients, the role of 
pharmacogenetics is determined by genetic effects on various pain types, as well 
as the genetic effect on drug safety and efficacy. In this review article, we 
discuss genetic polymorphisms present in different types of chronic pain, such 
as fibromyalgia, low back pain, migraine, painful peripheral diabetic neuropathy 
and trigeminal neuralgia. Furthermore, we discuss the role of CYP450 enzymes 
involved in metabolism of drugs, which have been used for treatment of chronic 
pain (amitriptyline, duloxetine, opioids, etc.). We also discuss how 
pharmacogenetics can be applied towards improving drug efficacy, shortening the 
time required to achieve therapeutic outcomes, reducing risks of side effects, 
and reducing medical costs and reliance upon polypharmacy.
