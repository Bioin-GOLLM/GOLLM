OBJECTIVE: Dopamine is very commonly used in the critical care setting and 
impacts glucose homeostasis. In some studies, it is noted to increase insulin 
resistance or decrease insulin secretion. The role of insulin secretion in 
response to dopamine is incompletely understood.
METHODS: Eight individuals underwent a hyperglycemic clamp with a dopamine 
infusion, and eight controls underwent hyperglycemic clamp alone. Insulin, 
C-peptide, glucagon, cortisol, and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were 
measured at various time points. An index of insulin sensitivity (M/I) was 
calculated. Statistical comparison between the control and treatment arm was 
done using repeated measures ANOVA. The data is expressed as mean Â± standard 
deviation. Paired t-test was used to compare pre- and post-dopamine infusion 
time points in the study individuals only. Data was considered to be 
statistically significant at P < 0.05.
RESULTS: On assessing the treatment group before and during dopamine infusion, 
insulin and C-peptide concentrations were higher at the time of the infusion (P 
= 0.02 and P = 0.003, respectively). The index of insulin sensitivity was not 
statistically different. There was a significant decrease in insulin (P = 
0.002), C-peptide (P = 0.005), and NE (P < 0.0001) concentrations in the 
treatment group, compared to the controls. Glucagon concentration was higher in 
the treatment group (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: In this study, dopamine infusion did not adversely impact insulin 
secretion.
