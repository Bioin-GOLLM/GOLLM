BACKGROUND: Risperidone is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in 
the liver. The gene encoding CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic. The average 
steady-state plasma concentration of risperidone active moiety is higher in the 
CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) compared with that in the extensive 
metabolizers (EMs). An association between drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms 
scale (DIEPSS) score and CYP2D6 polymorphisms has not been reported to date. 
This study investigates the association of CYP2D6 polymorphisms with the 
severity of extrapyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia patients receiving 
risperidone therapy.
METHODS: Schizophrenia patients undergoing risperidone treatment were recruited 
for the study in the Kobe University Hospital. We evaluated extrapyramidal 
symptoms of schizophrenia using the DIEPSS. CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*14 were 
analyzed using TaqMan® assays, and CYP2D6*5 was analyzed using the long-PCR 
method. Patients with CYP2D6*1/*5, *1/*14, *5/*10, *10/*10, and *10/*14 were 
classified as IMs, and patients with CYP2D6*1/*1 and *1/*10 were classified as 
EMs. Patients with CYP2D6*5/*5, *5/*14, and *14/*14 were classified as poor 
metabolizers (PMs).
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were included in the study. No patients were 
classified as PMs. The dose of risperidone (mg/day) was not significantly 
different between EMs (n = 15) and IMs (n = 7) (median with the interquartile 
range: 4.0 (2.0-6.0) vs. 4.0 (2.0-7.0) mg, p = 0.31). The age and disease 
duration of schizophrenia were not significantly different between the EMs and 
IMs. The DIEPSS score in the IMs was significantly higher than that in the EMs 
(median with the interquartile range: 5.0 (3.5-6.5) vs. 0.0 (0.0-3.0), 
p < 0.001). The multiple regression analysis showed that CYP2D6 IMs is a 
significant risk factor for the DIEPSS (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Special attentions should be paid to the onset of extrapyramidal 
symptoms in schizophrenia patients identified as CYP2D6 IM undergoing 
risperidone therapy.
