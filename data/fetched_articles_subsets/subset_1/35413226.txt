OBJECTIVES: LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein (LRBA) deficiency abolishes 
LRBA protein expression due to biallelic mutations in the LRBA gene that lead to 
autoimmune manifestations, inflammatory bowel disease, hypogammaglobulinemia in 
early stages, and variable clinical manifestations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mutational analysis of the LRBA gene was performed in 
Indian patients using targeted Next Generation Sequencing (t-NGS) and confirmed 
by Sanger sequencing using specific primers of exons 53. Then, bioinformatics 
analysis and protein modeling for the novel founded mutations were also 
performed. The genotype, phenotype correlation was done according to the 
molecular findings and clinical features.
RESULTS: We report an unusual case of a female patient born of a consanguineous 
marriage, presented with severe anaemia and jaundice with a history of multiple 
blood transfusions of unknown cause up to the age of 5 yrs. She had 
hepatosplenomegaly with recurrent viral and bacterial infections. Tests for 
hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, and hereditary spherocytosis were within the 
normal limits. The t-NGS revealed a novel homozygous missense variation in exon 
53 of the LRBA gene (chr4:151231464C > T; c.7799G > A) (p.C2600Y), and the 
parents were heterozygous. The further immunological analysis is suggestive of 
hypogammaglobulinaemia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The bioinformatics 
tools are suggestive of deleterious and disease-causing variants.
CONCLUSION: This study concludes the importance of a timely decision of targeted 
exome sequencing for the molecular diagnostic tool of unexplained haemolytic 
anaemia with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes.
