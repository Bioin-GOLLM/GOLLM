The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex involves a series of 
mechanisms: from patterning, progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, 
to neuronal migration. Many factors influence the development of the cerebral 
cortex to its normal size and neuronal composition. Of these, the mechanisms 
that influence the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells 
are of particular interest, as they may have the greatest consequence on brain 
size, not only during development but also in evolution. In this context, 
causative genes of human autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, such as ASPM 
and MCPH1, are attractive candidates, as many of them show positive selection 
during primate evolution. MCPH1 causes microcephaly in mice and humans and is 
involved in a diverse array of molecular functions beyond brain development, 
including DNA repair and chromosome condensation. Positive selection of MCPH1 in 
the primate lineage has led to much insight and discussion of its role in brain 
size evolution. In this review, we will present an overview of MCPH1 from these 
multiple angles, and whilst its specific role in brain size regulation during 
development and evolution remain elusive, the pieces of the puzzle will be 
discussed with the aim of putting together the full picture of this fascinating 
gene.
