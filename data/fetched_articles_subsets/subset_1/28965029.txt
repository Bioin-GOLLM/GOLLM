Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an increasingly adopted technology for 
insulin-requiring patients that provides insights into glycemic fluctuations. 
CGM can assist patients in managing their diabetes with lifestyle and medication 
adjustments. This article provides an overview of the technical and clinical 
features of CGM based on a review of articles in PubMed on CGM from 1999 through 
January 31, 2017. A detailed description is presented of three professional 
(retrospective), three personal (real-time) continuous glucose monitors, and 
three sensor integrated pumps (consisting of a sensor and pump that communicate 
with each other to determine an optimal insulin dose and adjust the delivery of 
insulin) that are currently available in United States. We have reviewed 
outpatient CGM outcomes, focusing on hemoglobin A1c (A1C), hypoglycemia, and 
quality of life. Issues affecting accuracy, detection of glycemic variability, 
strategies for optimal use, as well as cybersecurity and future directions for 
sensor design and use are discussed. In conclusion, CGM is an important tool for 
monitoring diabetes that has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with 
type 1 diabetes mellitus. Given currently available data and technological 
developments, we believe that with appropriate patient education, CGM can also 
be considered for other patient populations.
