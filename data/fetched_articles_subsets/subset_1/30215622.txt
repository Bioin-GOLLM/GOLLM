Stroke is a worldwide leading cause of death and long-term disability with 
concurrent secondary consequences that are largely comprised of mood 
dysfunction, as well as sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits. This review 
focuses on the cognitive deficits associated with stroke specific to executive 
dysfunction (including decision making, working memory, and cognitive 
flexibility) in humans, nonhuman primates, and additional animal models. 
Further, we review some of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the 
individual components of executive dysfunction and their neuroanatomical 
substrates after stroke, with an emphasis on the changes that occur during 
biogenic monoamine neurotransmission. We concentrate primarily on changes in the 
catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and noradrenergic) and serotonergic systems at 
the levels of neurotransmitter synthesis, distribution, reuptake, and 
degradation. We also discuss potential secondary stroke-related behavioral 
deficits (specifically, poststroke depression as well as drug-abuse potential 
and addiction) and their relationship with stroke-induced deficits in executive 
function, an especially important consideration given that the average age of 
the human stroke population is decreasing. In the final sections, we address 
pharmacological considerations for the treatment of ischemia and the subsequent 
functional impairment, as well as current limitations in the field of stroke and 
executive function research.
