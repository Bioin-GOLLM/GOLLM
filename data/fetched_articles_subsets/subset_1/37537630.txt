INTRODUCTION: Gliomas, a type of brain neoplasm, are prevalent and often fatal. 
Molecular diagnostics have improved understanding, but treatment options are 
limited. This study investigates the role of INTS9 in processing small nuclear 
RNA (snRNA), which is crucial to generating mature messenger RNA (mRNA). We aim 
to employ advanced bioinformatics analyses with large-scale databases and 
conduct functional experiments to elucidate its potential role in glioma 
therapeutics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected genomic, proteomic, and 
Whole-Exon-Sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese 
Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) for bioinformatic analyses. Then, we validated INTS9 
protein expression through immunohistochemistry and assessed its correlation 
with P53 and KI67 protein expression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was 
performed to identify altered signaling pathways, and functional experiments 
were conducted on three cell lines treated with siINTS9. Then, we also 
investigate the impacts of tumor heterogeneity on INTS9 expression by 
integrating single-cell sequencing, 12-cell state prediction, and CIBERSORT 
analyses. Finally, we also observed longitudinal changes in INTS9 using the 
Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) dataset.
RESULTS: Our findings showed increased INTS9 levels in tumor tissue compared to 
non-neoplastic components, correlating with high tumor grading and proliferation 
index. TP53 mutation was the most notable factor associated with upregulated 
INTS9, along with other potential contributors, such as combined chromosome 7 
gain/10 loss, TERT promoter mutation, and increased Tumor Mutational Burden 
(TMB). In GSEA analyses, we also linked INTS9 with enhanced cell proliferation 
and inflammation signaling. Downregulating INTS9 impacted cellular proliferation 
and cell cycle regulation during the function validation. In the context of the 
12 cell states, INTS9 correlated with tumor-stem and tumor-proliferative-stem 
cells. CIBERSORT analyses revealed increased INTS9 associated with increased 
macrophage M0 and M2 but depletion of monocytes. Longitudinally, we also noticed 
that the INTS9 expression declined during recurrence in IDH wildtype.
CONCLUSION: This study assessed the role of INTS9 protein in glioma development 
and its potential as a therapeutic target. Results indicated elevated INTS9 
levels were linked to increased proliferation capacity, higher tumor grading, 
and poorer prognosis, potentially resulting from TP53 mutations. This research 
highlights the potential of INTS9 as a promising target for glioma treatment.
