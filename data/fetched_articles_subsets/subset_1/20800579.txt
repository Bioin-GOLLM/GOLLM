Experimental kinetics and computational modeling of human glutathione synthetase 
(hGS) support the significant role of the G-loop glycine triad (G369, G370, 
G371) for activity of this ATP-grasp enzyme. Enzyme kinetic experiments indicate 
that G369V and G370V mutant hGS have little activity (<0.7 and 0.3%, 
respectively, versus wild-type hGS). However, G371V retains ∼13% of the activity 
of wild-type hGS. With respect to G-loop:A-loop interaction in hGS, mutations at 
Gly369 and Gly370 decrease ligand binding and prevent active site closure and 
protection. This research indicates that Gly369 and Gly370 have essential roles 
in hGS, while Gly371 has a lesser involvement. Implications for glycine-rich 
ensembles in other phosphate-binding enzymes are discussed.
