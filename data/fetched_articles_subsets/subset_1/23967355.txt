B cells signal through both the B cell receptor (BCR) which binds antigens and 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) including TLR9 which recognises CpG DNA. Activation 
of TLR9 synergises with BCR signalling when the BCR and TLR9 co-localise within 
an auto-phagosome-like compartment. Here we report that Bruton's tyrosine kinase 
(BTK) is required for synergistic IL6 production and up-regulation of surface 
expression of MHC-class-II, CD69 and CD86 in primary murine and human B cells. 
We show that BTK is essential for co-localisation of the BCR and TLR9 within a 
potential auto-phagosome-like compartment in the Namalwa human B cell line. 
Downstream of BTK we find that calcium acting via calmodulin is required for 
this process. These data provide new insights into the role of BTK, an important 
target for autoimmune diseases, in B cell activation.
