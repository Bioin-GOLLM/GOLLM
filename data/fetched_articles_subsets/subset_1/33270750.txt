Cluster of differentiation (CD) 166 or activated leukocyte cell adhesion 
molecule (ALCAM) is a transmembrane molecule known to be an intercellular 
adhesion factor. The expression and function of ALCAM in medulloblastoma (MB), a 
pediatric brain tumor with highly advanced molecular genetics, remains unclear. 
Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the significance and functional role of 
ALCAM expression in MB. ALCAM expression in 45 patients with MB was evaluated by 
immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical 
specimens and the relationship between ALCAM expression and pathological 
type/molecular subgroup, such as WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4, was examined. 
Eight ALCAM positive (18%), seven partially positive (16%), and 30 negative 
(67%) cases were detected. All seven cases of the WNT molecular subgroup were 
ALCAM positive and ALCAM expression strongly correlated with this subgroup (P < 
0.0001). In addition, functional studies using MB cell lines revealed ALCAM 
expression affected proliferation and migration as a positive regulator in 
vitro. However, ALCAM silencing did not affect survival or the formation of 
leptomeningeal dissemination in an orthotopic mouse model, but did induce a 
malignant phenotype with increased tumor cell invasion at the dissemination 
sites (P = 0.0029). In conclusion, our results revealed that ALCAM exhibited 
highly specific expression in the WNT subgroup of MB. Furthermore, we 
demonstrated that the cell kinetics of MB cell lines can be altered by the 
expression of ALCAM.
