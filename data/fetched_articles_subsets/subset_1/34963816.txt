Hypoxia and hypoxemia are two different entities. Correcting hypoxemia without 
hypoxia tends to have disastrous effects and delays lung healing. In this study, 
we share a case of an elderly man with moderate COVID-19 who never received any 
form of supplemental oxygen as compared to other patients with similar 
presentation.
