The West Nile Virus (WNV) envelope protein, E, promotes membrane fusion during 
viral cell entry by undergoing a low-pH triggered conformational reorganization. 
We have examined the mechanism of WNV fusion and sought evidence for potential 
intermediates during the conformational transition by following hemifusion of 
WNV virus-like particles (VLPs) in a single particle format. We have introduced 
specific mutations into E, to relate their influence on fusion kinetics to 
structural features of the protein. At the level of individual E subunits, 
trimer formation and membrane engagement of the threefold clustered fusion loops 
are rate-limiting. Hemifusion requires at least two adjacent trimers. Simulation 
of the kinetics indicates that availability of competent monomers within the 
contact zone between virus and target membrane makes trimerization a bottleneck 
in hemifusion. We discuss the implications of the model we have derived for 
mechanisms of membrane fusion in other contexts.
