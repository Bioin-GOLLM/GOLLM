We identified ∼30-mer amyloid-β protein (Aβ) assemblies, termed amylospheroids, 
from brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) as toxic entities 
responsible for neurodegeneration and showed that Na+,K+-ATPase α3 (NAKα3) is 
the sole target of amylospheroid-mediated neurodegeneration. However, it remains 
unclear where in neurons amylospheroids form and how they reach their targets to 
induce neurodegeneration. Here, we present an in vitro culture system designed 
to chronologically follow amylospheroid formation in mature neurons expressing 
amyloid precursor protein bearing early-onset AD mutations. Amylospheroids were 
found to accumulate mainly in the trans-Golgi network of excitatory neurons and 
were initially transported in axons. Proteasome inhibition 
dramatically increased amylospheroid amounts in trans-Golgi by increasing Aβ 
levels and induced dendritic transport. Amylospheroids were secreted and caused 
the degeneration of adjacent NAKα3-expressing neurons. Interestingly, the 
ASPD-producing neurons later died non-apoptotically. Our findings demonstrate a 
link between ASPD levels and proteasome function, which may have important 
implications for AD pathophysiology.
