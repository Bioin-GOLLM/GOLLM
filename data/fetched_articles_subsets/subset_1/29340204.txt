BACKGROUND: Side alternating vibration training (SAVT) is a mechanical 
oscillation using a vibrating platform that simulates exercise. We hypothesized 
that patients with mitochondrial myopathies, who experience muscle weakness, may 
see an improvement in muscle power with SAVT.
METHODS: Patients with mitochondrial disease started either a treatment (SAVT) 
or control phase (standing without vibration) for 12 weeks, then 12 weeks of 
washout, and then a 12-week cross-over. The main outcome measure was peak jump 
power (PJP). We compared this to a natural history cohort from clinic.
RESULTS: Seven out of 13 patients completed at least 80% of their SAVT sessions 
and were analyzed. The ΔPJP after the control phase was -2.7 ± 1.7 W/kg 
(mean ± SEM), SAVT was +2.8 ± 0.6 W/kg (p < 0.05) and from the natural history 
cohort was -2.4 ± 0.8 W/kg/year.
CONCLUSIONS: SAVT is well tolerated and may improve muscle power in 
mitochondrial disease patients.
