BACKGROUND Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is widely expressed in many tissues 
of the body, but it is rarely reported to be expressed in the eyes. This 
research explored the expression and distribution of CaSR in eye tissues of 
normal and diabetic rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty male Sprague Dawley (SD) 
rats were randomly divided into a diabetic and a normal group. Diabetes mellitus 
(DM) models were successfully established by intraperitoneal injection of 
streptozotocin. The expression and distribution of CaSR in the rat eyeballs were 
detected by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting were 
used to detect the presence of CaSR in normal and diabetic rats. RESULTS CaSR 
was detected in the cornea, lens epithelium, and retina. CaSR was expressed the 
most in the cornea, followed by the lens epithelium, and the retina (p<0.05). 
The expression of CaSR was decreased in the eye tissue of diabetic rats 
(p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this study, CaSR was detected in rat cornea, lens, and 
retina. It was significantly decreased in the eyes of diabetic rats. This 
indicated that the downregulated expression of CaSR was associated with diabetic 
oculopathy.
