BACKGROUND: Physiological changes that occur during pregnancy can influence 
serum lipid levels and laboratory tests for renal function. Therefore, we 
established consecutive and reliable RIs for serum lipid and renal function 
indices for pregnant women in China throughout the entirety of pregnancy.
METHODS: We included 120 healthy pregnant women who underwent a naturally 
conceived and uncomplicated pregnancy and delivered a healthy singleton neonate. 
Serum samples were collected at ten time points (pre-pregnancy, gestational 
age ≤ 8 weeks (W), 8 W+1 to 12 W, 12 W+1 to 16 W, 16 W+1 to 20 W, 20 W+1 to 
24 W, 24 W+1 to 28 W, 28 W+1 to 32 W, 32 W+1 to 36 W, and 36 W+1 to 40 W) and 
analyzed for ten common serum lipid and renal function analytes. RIs were 
calculated according to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and 
Laboratory Medicine recommendations and compared with the established RIs for 
healthy adult women.
RESULTS: During pregnancy, we observed significant increases in total 
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein-A1 
(Apo-A1), apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B), cystatin C (Cys-C), and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR). We also observed clear reductions in urea, creatinine 
(Crea), and uric acid (UA). Compared with the previously established RIs, the 
most significant misclassifications were recorded for TG, Apo-A1, Crea, and 
eGFR.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully described key changes in serum lipid levels and 
renal function indices throughout pregnancy. It is important to establish RIs 
for blood indices in women undergoing normal pregnancies during different period 
of pregnancy to avoid the misdiagnosis of disease states.
