INTRODUCTION: Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is regularly 
altered in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). Serine/threonine-protein kinase 
B-Raf (BRAF) V600E mutations were observed very frequently in PTC along with 
less frequent rat sarcoma (RAS) and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene, 
also known as RET/PTC translocation. The present study aimed to analyze the 
mutational profile of PTCs from an endemic Goiter area of North India.
METHODOLOGY: Tissues from 109 PTC patients were used to isolate DNA and RNA. 
BRAF V600E was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR). RAS mutations were screened by using Sanger's sequencing 
method. RET/PTC rearrangements were analyzed by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 51.38% (56/109) of PTCs, whereas 
RAS mutations were less frequent. No RET/PTC rearrangements were observed. BRAF 
V600E was found to be associated with the aggressive clinicopathological 
features such as lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, higher 
tumor-node-metastasis stages, and high-risk groups.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of BRAF V600E is high in patients from Indian 
Subcontinent and found to be associated with aggressive features of PTC. 
Concomitant mutations of BRAF V600E and RAS mutations impart more aggressiveness 
to PTCs.
