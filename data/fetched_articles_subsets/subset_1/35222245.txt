ADPRHL2 gene mutations have been demonstrated as the cause of stress-induced 
childhood-onset neurodegeneration with variable ataxia and seizures (CONDSIAS), 
an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by an abnormal gait, 
intellectual disability, seizures, ataxia, other nervous system degenerative 
diseases, and axonal sensorimotor neuropathy. Since first reported in 2018, 
ADP-ribosylhydrolase like 2 (ADPRHL2) gene mutations in previous cases were all 
diallelic homozygous. Here, we report a case of CONDSIAS with a novel compound 
heterozygous mutation in the ADPRHL2 gene. This patient is presented with 
autonomic nervous dysfunction manifested as polyuria, gastrointestinal 
disturbance, and sinus arrhythmia, which may be considered as new clinical 
manifestations in addition to the above classical manifestations. Muscle biopsy 
revealed myogenic lesions, which is a previously unreported feature.
