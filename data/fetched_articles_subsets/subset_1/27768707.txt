In eukaryotes, Dom34 upregulates translation by securing levels of activatable 
ribosomal subunits. We found that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the 
human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, Dom34 interacts genetically with Pmt1, a 
major isoform of protein O-mannosyltransferase. In C. albicans, lack of Dom34 
exacerbated defective phenotypes of pmt1 mutants, while they were ameliorated by 
Dom34 overproduction that enhanced Pmt1 protein but not PMT1 transcript levels. 
Translational effects of Dom34 required the 5'-UTR of the PMT1 transcript, which 
bound recombinant Dom34 directly at a CA/AC-rich sequence and regulated in vitro 
translation. Polysomal profiling revealed that Dom34 stimulates general 
translation moderately, but that it is especially required for translation of 
transcripts encoding Pmt isoforms 1, 4 and 6. Because defective protein N- or 
O-glycosylation upregulates transcription of PMT genes, it appears that 
Dom34-mediated specific translational upregulation of the PMT transcripts 
optimizes cellular responses to glycostress. Its translational function as an 
RNA binding protein acting at the 5'-UTR of specific transcripts adds another 
facet to the known ribosome-releasing functions of Dom34 at the 3'-UTR of 
transcripts.
