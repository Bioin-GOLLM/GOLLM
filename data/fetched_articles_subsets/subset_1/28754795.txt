Background: The higher risk of pancreatic cancer in Ashkenazi Jews compared with 
non-Jews is only partially explained by the increased frequency of BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jews.Methods: We evaluated the impact of 16 
established pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci in a case-control sample of 
American Jews, largely Ashkenazi, including 406 full-Jewish pancreatic cancer 
patients and 2,332 full-Jewish controls, genotyped as part of the Pancreatic 
Cancer Cohort and Case-Control Consortium I/II (PanScan I/II), Pancreatic Cancer 
Case-Control Consortium (PanC4), and Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research 
on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) datasets. We compared risk in full-Jewish 
subjects with risk in part-Jewish; non-Jewish Southern European; and in the 
combined non-Jewish Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western European 
(non-Jewish white European) subjects from the same datasets. Jewish ancestries 
were genetically identified using seeded Fast principal component analysis. Data 
were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression, and adjusted for age, sex, 
and principal components.Results: One SNP on chromosome 13q22.1 (rs9543325; OR, 
1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.58; P = 10-4.1) was significant in 
full-Jews. Individual ORs and minor allele frequencies were similar between 
Jewish and non-Jewish white European subjects. The average ORs across the 16 
pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci for full-Jewish, full- plus part-Jewish, 
non-Jewish Southern European, and non-Jewish white European subjects were 1.25, 
1.30, 1.31, and 1.26, respectively.Conclusions: The 16 pancreatic cancer 
susceptibility loci similarly impact Jewish and non-Jewish white European 
subjects, both individually and as summary odds.Impact: These 16 pancreatic 
cancer susceptibility loci likely do not explain the higher risk seen in 
Ashkenazi Jews. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(10); 1540-8. ©2017 AACR.
