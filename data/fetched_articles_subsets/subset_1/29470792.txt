Pressing need for utilization of injectables/fillers in various forms of 
orthopaedic treatments/surgeries commands an equal demand for better graft 
material. Injectable bone graft material based on biomimetically synthesized 
nanohydroxyapatite was developed and subjected to ball milling for different 
times; three materials thus produced were evaluated for their biological 
properties. The three composites tested were found to have some difference in 
proliferation and differentiation on mesenchymal stem cells in cultures. In vivo 
studies were performed by implanting the graft materials with or without cells 
in the bone drill hole injury created in the femur of Wistar rats. Our studies 
show that the composites lead to well-healed injury site with normal histology 
without inflammation or fibrous tissue formation and bone deformity. This 
material needs to be tested on large animals for further ascertaining its 
applicability in clinical use.
