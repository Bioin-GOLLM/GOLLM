PURPOSE: To determine the role of CD49d for response to Bruton's tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (BTKi) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In patients treated with acalabrutinib (n = 48), CD49d 
expression, VLA-4 integrin activation, and tumor transcriptomes of CLL cells 
were assessed. Clinical responses to BTKis were investigated in acalabrutinib- 
(n = 48; NCT02337829) and ibrutinib-treated (n = 73; NCT01500733) patients.
RESULTS: In patients treated with acalabrutinib, treatment-induced lymphocytosis 
was comparable for both subgroups but resolved more rapidly for CD49d+ cases. 
Acalabrutinib inhibited constitutive VLA-4 activation but was insufficient to 
block BCR and CXCR4-mediated inside-out activation. Transcriptomes of CD49d+ and 
CD49d- cases were compared using RNA sequencing at baseline and at 1 and 6 
months on treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed increased 
constitutive NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling, enhanced survival, adhesion, and 
migratory capacity in CD49d+ over CD49d- CLL that was maintained during therapy. 
In the combined cohorts of 121 BTKi-treated patients, 48 (39.7%) progressed on 
treatment with BTK and/or PLCG2 mutations detected in 87% of CLL progressions. 
Consistent with a recent report, homogeneous and bimodal CD49d-positive cases 
(the latter having concurrent CD49d+ and CD49d- CLL subpopulations, irrespective 
of the traditional 30% cutoff value) had a shorter time to progression of 6.6 
years, whereas 90% of cases homogenously CD49d- were estimated progression-free 
at 8 years (P = 0.0004).
CONCLUSIONS: CD49d/VLA-4 emerges as a microenvironmental factor that contributes 
to BTKi resistance in CLL. The prognostic value of CD49d is improved by 
considering bimodal CD49d expression. See related commentary by Tissino et al., 
p. 3560.
