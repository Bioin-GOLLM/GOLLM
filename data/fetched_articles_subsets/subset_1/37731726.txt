Enhanced recognition ability, cell uptake capacity, and biostability are 
characteristics attributed to aptamer-based targeted anticancer agents, and are 
possibly associated with increased accumulation at the tumor site, improved 
therapeutic efficacy and reduced negative side effects. Herein, a 
phosphorothioate backbone modification strategy was applied to regulate the 
biomedical properties of pancreatic cancer cell-targeting aptamer for efficient 
in vivo drug delivery. Specifically, the CD71- targeting aptamer XQ-2d was 
modified into a fully thio-substituted aptamer S-XQ-2d, improving the plasma 
stability of S-XQ-2d and mitomycin C (MMC)-functionalized S-XQ-2d (MFSX), thus 
considerably prolonging their half-life in mice. Moreover, the binding and 
uptake capacities of S-XQ-2d were significantly enhanced. MFSX showed the same 
level of cytotoxicity as that of MMC against targeted cancer cells, but lower 
toxicity to non-targeted cells, highlighting its specificity and biosafety. 
Brief mechanistic studies demonstrated that XQ-2d and S-XQ-2d had different 
interaction modes and internalization pathways with the targeted cells.
