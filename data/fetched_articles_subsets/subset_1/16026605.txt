BACKGROUND: This paper describes a microarray study including data quality 
control, data analysis and the analysis of the mechanism of toxicity (MOT) 
induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma 
cell line (PC12 cells) using bioinformatics tools. MPP+ depletes dopamine 
content and elicits cell death in PC12 cells. However, the mechanism of 
MPP+-induced neurotoxicity is still unclear.
RESULTS: In this study, Agilent rat oligo 22K microarrays were used to examine 
alterations in gene expression of PC12 cells after 500 muM MPP+ treatment. 
Relative gene expression of control and treated cells represented by spot 
intensities on the array chips was analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Raw data 
from each array were input into the NCTR ArrayTrack database, and normalized 
using a Lowess normalization method. Data quality was monitored in ArrayTrack. 
The means of the averaged log ratio of the paired samples were used to identify 
the fold changes of gene expression in PC12 cells after MPP+ treatment. Our data 
showed that 106 genes and ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) were changed 2-fold and 
above with MPP+ treatment; among these, 75 genes had gene symbols and 59 genes 
had known functions according to the Agilent gene Refguide and ArrayTrack-linked 
gene library. The mechanism of MPP+-induced toxicity in PC12 cells was analyzed 
based on their genes functions, biological process, pathways and previous 
published literatures.
CONCLUSION: Multiple pathways were suggested to be involved in the mechanism of 
MPP+-induced toxicity, including oxidative stress, DNA and protein damage, cell 
cycling arrest, and apoptosis.
