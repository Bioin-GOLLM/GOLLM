Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to 
threaten the lives of hundreds of millions of people, with a severe negative 
impact on the global economy. Although several COVID-19 vaccines are currently 
being administered, none of them is 100% effective. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 
variants remain an important worldwide public health issue. Hence, the 
accelerated development of efficacious antiviral agents is urgently needed. 
Coronavirus depends on various host cell factors for replication. An ongoing 
research objective is the identification of host factors that could be exploited 
as targets for drugs and compounds effective against SARS-CoV-2. In the present 
review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and related 
coronaviruses, focusing on the host factors or pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 
replication that have been identified by genome-wide CRISPR screening.
