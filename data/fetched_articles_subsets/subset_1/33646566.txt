Tacrolimus dose, blood concentrations and acute nephrotoxicity, but not 
CYP3A5/ABCB1 genetics, are associated with allograft tacrolimus concentrations 
in renal transplant recipients.

AIMS: Long-term use of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus is limited by 
nephrotoxicity. Following renal transplantation, the risk of nephrotoxicity may 
be determined more by allograft than by blood tacrolimus concentrations, and 
thus may be affected by donor CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genetics. Little is known 
regarding factors that determine tacrolimus intrarenal exposure.
METHODS: This study investigated the relationship between trough blood (C0Blood 
) and allograft (CGraft ) tacrolimus concentrations and tacrolimus dose, 
haematocrit, genetics, acute nephrotoxicity, rejection status, delayed graft 
function, and time post-transplant. C0Blood and CGraft were quantified in 132 
renal transplant recipients together with recipient and donor CYP3A5 (rs776746) 
and ABCB1 3435 (rs1045642) genotypes.
RESULTS: C0Blood ranged from 2.6 to 52.3 ng/mL and CGraft from 33 to 828 pg/mg 
tissue. Adjusting for dose, recipients who were CYP3A5 expressors had lower 
C0Blood compared to nonexpressors, whilst delayed graft function was associated 
with higher C0Blood . Linear regression showed that the significant predictors 
of CGraft were C0Blood (point-wise P = 7 × 10-10 ), dose (P = .004) acute 
nephrotoxicity (P = .002) and an interaction between C0Blood and acute 
tacrolimus nephrotoxicity (P = .0002), with an adjusted r2  = 0.35 and no 
contribution from donor or recipient CYP3A5 or ABCB1 genotype. The association 
between CGraft and acute nephrotoxicity depended on one very high CGraft 
(828 pg/mg tissue).
CONCLUSIONS: Recipient and donor CYP3A5 and ABCB1 3435C>T genotypes are not 
determinants of allograft tacrolimus exposure in kidney transplant recipients. 
However, tacrolimus dose and C0Blood were significant predictors of CGraft , and 
the relationship between C0Blood and CGraft appeared to differ in the presence 
or absence of acute nephrotoxicity.
