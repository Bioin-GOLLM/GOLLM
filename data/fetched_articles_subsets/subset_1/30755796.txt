As their name implies, cation channels allow the regulated flow of cations such 
as sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium across cellular and intracellular 
membranes. Cation channels have long been known for their fundamental roles in 
controlling membrane potential and excitability in neurons and muscle. In this 
review, we provide an update on the recent advances in our understanding of the 
structure-function relationship and the physiological and pathophysiological 
role of cation channels. The most exciting developments in the last two years, 
in our opinion, have been the insights that cryoelectron microscopy has provided 
into the inner life and the gating of not only voltage-gated channels but also 
mechanosensitive and calcium- or sodium-activated channels. The mechanosensitive 
Piezo channels especially have delighted the field not only with a fascinating 
new type of structure but with important roles in blood pressure regulation and 
lung function.
