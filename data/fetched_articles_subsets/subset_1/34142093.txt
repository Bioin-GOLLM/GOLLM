Organoid technologies enable the creation of in vitro physiologic systems that 
model tissues of origin more accurately than classical culture approaches. 
Seminal characteristics, including three-dimensional structure and 
recapitulation of self-renewal, differentiation, and disease pathology, render 
organoids eminently suited as hybrids that combine the experimental tractability 
of traditional 2D cell lines with cellular attributes of in vivo model systems. 
Here, we describe recent advances in this rapidly evolving field and their 
applications in cancer biology, clinical translation and precision medicine.
