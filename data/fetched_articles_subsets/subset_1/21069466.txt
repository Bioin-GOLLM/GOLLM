Magnetic resonance imaging studies have begun to map effects of genetic 
variation on trajectories of brain development. Longitudinal studies of children 
and adolescents demonstrate a general pattern of childhood peaks of gray matter 
followed by adolescent declines, functional and structural increases in 
connectivity and integrative processing, and a changing balance between 
limbic/subcortical and frontal lobe functions, which extends well into young 
adulthood. Twin studies have demonstrated that genetic factors are responsible 
for a significant amount of variation in pediatric brain morphometry. 
Longitudinal studies have shown specific genetic polymorphisms affect rates of 
cortical changes associated with maturation. Although over-interpretation and 
premature application of neuroimaging findings for diagnostic purposes remains a 
risk, converging data from multiple imaging modalities is beginning to elucidate 
the influences of genetic factors on brain development and implications of 
maturational changes for cognition, emotion, and behavior.
