Cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or unfolded protein 
response (UPR) is a key defense mechanism associated with many human diseases. 
Despite its basic and clinical importance, the extent of ER stress inflicted by 
physiological and pathophysiological conditions remains difficult to quantitate, 
posing a huge obstacle that has hindered our further understanding of 
physiological UPR and its future therapeutic potential. Here we have optimized a 
Phos-tag-based system to detect the activation status of two proximal UPR 
sensors at the ER membrane. This method allowed for a quantitative assessment of 
the level of stress in the ER. Our data revealed quantitatively the extent of 
tissue-specific basal ER stress as well as ER stress caused by the accumulation 
of misfolded proteins and the fasting-refeeding cycle. Our study may pave the 
foundation for future studies on physiological UPR, aid in the diagnosis of 
ER-associated diseases and improve and facilitate therapeutic strategies 
targeting UPR in vivo.
