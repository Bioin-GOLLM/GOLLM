Background and Purpose- Mechanisms contributing to acute hematoma growth in 
intracerebral hemorrhage are not well understood. Neuropathological studies 
suggest that the initial hematoma may create mass effect that can tear vessels 
in the vicinity by shearing, causing further bleeding and hematoma growth. 
Methods- To test this in mice, we simulated initial intracerebral hemorrhage by 
intrastriatal injection of a liquid polymer that coagulates upon contact with 
tissue and measured the presence and volume of bleeding secondary to the mass 
effect using Hemoglobin ELISA 15 minutes after injection. Results- Secondary 
hemorrhage occurred in a volume-dependent (4, 7.5, or 15 μL of polymer) and 
rate-dependent (0.05, 0.5, or 5 μL/s) manner. Anticoagulation (warfarin or 
dabigatran) exacerbated the secondary hemorrhage volume. In a second model of 
hematoma expansion, we confirmed that intrastriatal whole blood injection (15 
μL, 0.5 μL/s) also caused secondary bleeding, using acute Evans blue 
extravasation as a surrogate. Anticoagulation once again exacerbated secondary 
hemorrhage after intrastriatal whole blood injection. Secondary hemorrhage 
directly and significantly correlated with arterial blood pressures in both 
nonanticoagulated and anticoagulated mice, when modulated by phenylephrine or 
labetalol. Conclusions- Our study provides the first proof of concept for 
secondary vessel rupture and bleeding as a potential mechanism for intracerebral 
hematoma growth.
