The impact of statin therapy on plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels 
has not been conclusively studied. Therefore the aim of the meta-analysis was to 
assess the effect of statins on circulating ADMA levels. We searched selected 
databases (up to August 2014) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
that investigate the effect of statins on plasma ADMA concentrations. A weighted 
meta-regression (WMD) using unrestricted maximum likelihood model was performed 
to assess the impact of statin dose, duration of statin therapy and baseline 
ADMA concentrations as potential variables on the WMD between statin and placebo 
group. In total, 1134 participants in 9 selected RCTs were randomized; 568 were 
allocated to statin treatment and 566 were controls. There was a significant 
reduction in plasma ADMA concentrations following statin therapy compared with 
placebo (WMD: -0.104 μM, 95% confidence interval: -0.131 to -0.077, Z = -7.577, 
p < 0.0001). Subgroups analysis has shown a significant impact of hydrophilic 
statins (WMD: -0.207 μM, 95%CI: -0.427 to +0.013, Z = -7.250, p < .0001) and a 
non-significant effect of hydrophobic statins (WMD: -0.101 μM, 95%CI: -0.128 to 
-0.074, Z = -1.845, p = 0.065). In conclusion, this meta-analysis of available 
RCTs showed a significant reduction in plasma ADMA concentrations following 
therapy with hydrophilic statins.
