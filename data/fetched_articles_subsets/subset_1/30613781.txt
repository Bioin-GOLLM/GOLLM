An effective vaccine to the antigenically diverse hepatitis C virus (HCV) must 
target conserved immune epitopes. Here, we investigate cross-neutralization of 
HCV genotypes by broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) encoded by the 
relatively abundant human gene family V H 1-69. We have deciphered the molecular 
requirements for cross-neutralization by this unique class of human antibodies 
from crystal structures of HCV E2 in complex with bNAbs. An unusually high 
binding affinity is found for germ line-reverted versions of VH1-69 precursor 
antibodies, and neutralization breadth is acquired during affinity maturation. 
Deep sequencing analysis of an HCV-immune B cell repertoire further demonstrates 
the importance of the V H 1-69 gene family in the generation of HCV bNAbs. This 
study therefore provides critical insights into immune recognition of HCV with 
important implications for rational vaccine design.
