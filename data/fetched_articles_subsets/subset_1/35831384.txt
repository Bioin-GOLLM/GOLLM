Scarless genome editing of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is crucial for 
the precise modeling of genetic disease. Here we present CRISPR Del/Rei, a 
two-step deletion-reinsertion strategy with high editing efficiency and simple 
PCR-based screening that generates isogenic clones in ~ 2 months. We apply our 
strategy to edit iPSCs at 3 loci with only rare off target editing.
