BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most mitochondrial disorders with onset in early 
childhood are progressive and involve multiple organs. The m.3250T>C mutation in 
MTTL1 has previously been described in a few individuals with a possibly 
riboflavin-responsive myopathy and an association with sudden infant death 
syndrome was suspected. We describe a large family with this mutation and 
evaluate the effect of riboflavin treatment.
METHODS: Medical data were collected with the help of a standardized data 
collection form. Sanger sequencing was used to screen for variants in 
mitochondrial DNA and the proportion of the mutation was analyzed in different 
tissues. Biochemical and muscle morphological investigations of muscle tissue 
were performed in two individuals. The effect of riboflavin treatment was 
evaluated in two individuals.
RESULTS: Thirteen family members experienced exercise intolerance with fatigue 
and weakness. Inheritance was maternal with 100% penetrance. The course was 
either static or showed improvement over time. There was no evidence of other 
organ involvement except for a possible mild transient cardiac enlargement in 
one child. Muscle investigations showed isolated complex I deficiency and 
mitochondrial proliferation. The level of m.3250T>C was apparently 100%, i.e. 
homoplasmic, in all examined tissues. Riboflavin treatment showed no effect in 
any treated family member and there have been no cases of sudden infant death in 
this family.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the importance of considering mitochondrial 
disorders in the work-up of individuals with exercise intolerance and provides a 
better understanding of the phenotype associated with the m.3250T>C mutation in 
MTTL1.
