BACKGROUND: Salmonella ranks among the leading causes of bloodstream infections 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Multidrug resistant typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella 
(NTS) isolates have been previously identified in this region. However, 
resistance to ciprofloxacin has rarely been reported in West Africa. This study 
aims to assess susceptibility against ciprofloxacin in Salmonella causing 
invasive bloodstream infections among children in rural Ghana.
METHODS: From May 2007 until May 2012, children attending a rural district 
hospital in central Ghana were eligible for recruitment. Salmonella enterica 
isolated from blood cultures were assessed for ciprofloxacin susceptibility by 
Etest (susceptible minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≤ 0.06 µg/mL). The 
gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE genes were sequenced to identify mutations associated 
with changes in susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.
RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five Salmonella enterica isolates from 5211 blood 
cultures were most commonly identified as Salmonella enterica serovar 
Typhimurium (n = 129 [45%]), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (n = 89 [31%]), 
Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin (n = 20 [7%]), and Salmonella enterica 
serovar Enteritidis (n = 19 [7%]). All S. Typhi and S. Dublin were susceptible 
to ciprofloxacin. Reduced susceptibility (MIC >0.06 µg/mL) was found in 53% 
(10/19) of S. Enteritidis and in 2% (3/129) of S. Typhimurium isolates. 
Sequencing detected a single gyrB mutation (Glu466Asp) and a single gyrA 
mutation (Ser83Tyr) in all 3 S. Typhimurium isolates, while 9 of 10 S. 
Enteritidis harbored single gyrA mutations (Asp87Gly, Asp87Asn, or Asp87Tyr). No 
mutations were found in the parC and parE genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Ciprofloxacin susceptibility in invasive NTS in rural Ghana is 
highly dependent on serotype. Although reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility is 
low in S. Typhimurium, more than half of all S. Enteritidis isolates are 
affected. Healthcare practitioners in Ghana should be aware of potential 
treatment failure in patients with invasive S. Enteritidis infections.
