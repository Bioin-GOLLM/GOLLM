AIM: To investigate biomarkers for predicting papillary thyroid cancer outcomes.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The expression of biomarkers (ITGA2, SYT12 and CDH3) was 
studied in a prospective cohort of patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Three 
outcomes of initial metastases, baseline status and longitudinal status were 
analyzed and correlated with the biomarkers.
RESULTS: SYT12 provided the best prediction of initial metastasis (sensitivity: 
72%; specificity: 54%). SYT12 had the highest accuracy for predicting 
longitudinal status (sensitivity: 100%; specificity: 47%). The best performance 
for longitudinal status resulted from combining SYT12 with American Thyroid 
Association risk stratification, with sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 73%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: SYT12 has some prognostic significance in papillary thyroid cancer. 
Further validation studies in larger populations are warranted.
