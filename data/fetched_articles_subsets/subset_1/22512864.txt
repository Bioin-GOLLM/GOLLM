The cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) regulate many cellular processes, including 
the cell cycle, neuronal development, transcription, and posttranscriptional 
processing. To perform their functions, Cdks bind to specific cyclin subunits to 
form a functional and active cyclin/Cdk complex. This review is focused on 
Cyclin K, which was originally considered an alternative subunit of Cdk9, and on 
its newly identified partners, Cdk12 and Cdk13. We briefly summarize research 
devoted to each of these proteins. We also discuss the proteins' functions in 
the regulation of gene expression via the phosphorylation of serine 2 in the 
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, contributions to the maintenance of 
genome stability, and roles in the onset of human disease and embryo 
development.
