BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and kidney damage are tightly associated in 
people with type 2 diabetes. Experimental evidence supports a causal role for 
vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) in the development of diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD). Plasma copeptin, the COOH-terminal portion of pre-provasopressin 
and a surrogate marker of vasopressin, was shown to be positively associated 
with the development and progression of DKD. Here we assessed the association of 
plasma copeptin with the risk of cardiovascular events during follow-up in two 
prospective cohorts of type 2 diabetic patients, and we examined if this 
association could be mediated by deleterious effects of vasopressin on the 
kidney.
METHODS: We studied 3098 and 1407 type 2 diabetic patients from the French 
cohorts DIABHYCAR and SURDIAGENE, respectively. We considered the incidence 
during follow-up (median: 5 years) of a combined end point composed of 
myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, hospitalization for 
congestive heart failure, or cardiovascular death. Copeptin concentration was 
measured in baseline plasma samples by an immunoluminometric assay.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of cardiovascular events during follow-up by 
sex-specific tertiles of baseline plasma copeptin was 15.6% (T1), 18.7% (T2) and 
21.7% (T3) in DIABHYCAR (p = 0.002), and 27.7% (T1), 34.1% (T2) and 47.6% (T3) 
in SURDIAGENE (p < 0.0001). Cox proportional hazards survival regression 
analyses confirmed the association of copeptin with cardiovascular events in 
both cohorts: hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval for T3 vs. T1 was 1.29 
(1.04-1.59), p = 0.02 (DIABHYCAR), and 1.58 (1.23-2.04), p = 0.0004 
(SURDIAGENE), adjusted for sex, age, BMI, duration of diabetes, systolic blood 
pressure, arterial hypertension, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, 
triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin 
concentration (UAC), active tobacco smoking, and previous history of myocardial 
infarction at baseline. No interaction was observed between plasma copeptin and 
eGFR (p = 0.40) or UAC (p = 0.61) categories on the risk of cardiovascular 
events in analyses of pooled cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma copeptin was positively associated with major cardiovascular 
events in people with type 2 diabetes. This association cannot be solely 
accounted for by the association of copeptin with kidney-related traits.
