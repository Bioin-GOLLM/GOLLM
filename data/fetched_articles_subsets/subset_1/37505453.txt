OBJECTIVES: Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) and protein kinase C-B 
(PRKCB) contribute to cancer progression and angiogenesis. This study intended 
to detect SFRP1 and PRKCB expression in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients and analyze its association with clinicopathological features.
METHODS: A total of 108 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection in our 
hospital between 2012 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. SFRP1 and PRKCB 
expression was detected using immunohistochemical staining. The relationships 
between SFRP1 and PRKCB expression and clinicopathological data were analyzed 
using the chi-square method. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to investigate 
survival probability over time. The potential risk of NSCLC morbidity associated 
with SFRP1 and PRKCB levels was analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox 
proportional risk models.
RESULTS: SFRP1 and PRKCB expression was negative in 114 and 109 of the 180 NSCLC 
specimens, respectively. SFRP1 expression was significantly associated with TNM 
stage ( P  < 0.001) and tumor diameter ( P  < 0.001). PRKCB expression was 
significantly associated with the TNM stage ( P  < 0.001). The correlation 
between SFRP1 and PRKCB expression was evident ( P  = 0.023). SFRP1(-) or 
PRKCB(-) patients shows lower survival rates than SFRP1(+) or PRKCB(+) patients 
( P < 0.001). SFRP1(-)/PRKCB(-) patients had the worst prognosis ( P < 0.001). 
Furthermore, the mortality of SFRP1(-) or PRKCB(-) patients was significantly 
higher than that of SFRP1(+) or PRKCB(+).
CONCLUSION: SFRP1 and PRKCB expression can be used to predict prognosis in 
patients with NSCLC.
