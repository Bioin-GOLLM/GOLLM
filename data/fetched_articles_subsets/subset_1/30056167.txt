AIM: To investigate whether nuclear factor-kappa B1 (NFKB1) gene polymorphisms 
are associated with the outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a 
Chinese high-risk population.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 984 HCV-uninfected controls, 221 infected 
individuals with spontaneous HCV clearance, and 456 with persistent HCV 
infection were enrolled. Rs28362491 and rs72696119 were genotyped using the ABI 
TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. The functional annotation of the identified 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were further evaluated by bioinformatics 
analysis.
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed among the three groups 
(P < 0.001) in terms of the frequency of rs28362491 SNP. In logistic regression 
analysis, rs28362491-ATTG deleted (D) was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of HCV infection compared to the major-type rs28362491-ATTG 
inserted (I) (dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.332, 95% CI = 1.059-1.674, 
P = 0.014; additive model: adjusted OR = 1.181, 95% CI = 1.021-1.367, 
P = 0.025), after adjusting for age, gender, and route of infection. Based on 
the in silico prediction, the RegulomeDB score for SNP rs28362491 was 3a, 
indicating that it can potentially regulate the transcription and expression of 
NFKB1 gene.
CONCLUSION: NFKB1 rs28362491-D allele was functionally associated with the 
increased risk of susceptibility to HCV infection in the Chinese Han population.
