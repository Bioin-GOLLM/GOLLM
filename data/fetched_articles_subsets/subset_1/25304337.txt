Pycnodysostosis (OMIM # 265800) is an inherited lysosomal disorder due to 
affection of cathepsin K gene, localised to 1q21. Pycnodysostosis can present 
with both skeletal and extraskeletal features. The index patient presented with 
cardinal features of short stature, dental and digital anomalies with history of 
multiple fractures. He, in addition had an unreported finding of white matter 
hyperintensity suggesting dysmyelination on neuroimaging. Molecular analysis 
revealed a homozygous insertion of single nucleotide in exon 5 of the CTSK gene 
that produces the substitution of phenylalanine instead of leucine at position 
160 of protein and a premature termination of protein synthesis due to insertion 
of a stop codon. This mutation (c.480_481insT), (p.L160fsX173) is a novel 
frameshift mutation. The index case extends the phenotypic spectrum and the list 
of previously reported mutations in the CTSK gene.
