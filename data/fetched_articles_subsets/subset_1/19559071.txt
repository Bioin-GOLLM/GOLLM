OBJECTIVE: A direct comparison of the incidence and risk factors of major 
thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) 
according to their respective JAK2V617F allele burden is the object of this 
study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the rate (%/patients/year) of major 
thrombosis in 867 ET patients (57% JAK2V617F) with that of 415 PV patients (all 
JAK2V617F) and examined risk factors.
RESULTS: Patients with ET wild-type, ET V617F, and PV showed a rate of 
thrombosis of 1.4%, 2.1%, and 2.7%/patients/year, respectively. The latter was 
found to progressively increase according to time of diagnosis. Actuarial 
probability of arterial and venous thrombosis in the first 5 years of diagnosis 
was roughly similar in the three groups. While in the subsequent periods, the 
curves of mutated ET patients diverged from wild-type, and after 10 to 15 years 
the ET-mutated arm approached PV.
CONCLUSION: These findings support the concept of a continuum between ET JAK2 
mutated and PV, not only in reference to the hematological phenotype, but also 
in terms of vascular events.
