BACKGROUND: Dental caries is the most common infection in the world and is 
influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors are 
largely known, but the role of genetic factors is quite unknown. The aim was to 
investigate the genetic background of caries in Finnish adolescents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was carried out at the Kotka Health Center in 
Eastern Finland. 94 participants aged 15-17 years gave approval for the saliva 
and DNA analyses. However, one was excluded in DNA analysis; thus, the overall 
number of participants in analysis was 93. Caries status was recorded clinically 
and from bite-wing X-rays to all 94 participants. Genomic DNA was extracted by 
genomic QIAampÂ® DNA Blood Mini Kit and genotyped for polymorphisms. The results 
were analyzed using additive and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: No significant associations between caries and the genes studied were 
found. However, SNPs in DDX39B and MPO showed association tendencies but were 
not statistically significant after false discovery rate (FDR) analysis. SNPs in 
VDR, LTA, and MMP3 were not statistically significant with initial caries 
lesions after FDR analysis.
CONCLUSION: The present study could not demonstrate statistically significant 
associations between caries and the genes studied. Further studies with larger 
populations are needed.
