Ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome is a rare 
genetic disease with an autosomal dominant transmission, characterized by 
several congenital anomalies. Clinical features include ectodermal defects 
affecting the skin, hair, teeth, nails and sweat glands, associated with typical 
eyelid fusion in addition to a cleft lip and/or palate. The diagnosis is based 
on clinical criteria and molecular genetic testing of TP63 gene, the gene 
related to AEC syndrome. In this context, most reported mutations induce an 
amino acid change in the sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, and are predicted to 
disrupt protein-protein interactions. We here describe the case of a 2-year-old 
Moroccan girl diagnosed with AEC syndrome on the basis of clinical features. The 
molecular studies and bioinformatics tools revealed a novel heterozygous 
missense mutation c.1798G>C (p.Gly600Arg) in exon 14 of the TP63 gene, that was 
not found in her parents. The molecular analysis and the early diagnosis of this 
syndrome are important to offer appropriate genetic counseling and management to 
patients and their families.
