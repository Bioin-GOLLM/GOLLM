Both blood platelets and genetics contribute to the development of acute 
ischemic arterial diseases. A careful analysis of the various clinical 
association studies supports a modest increased risk for coronary artery disease 
events in carriers of the PIA2 polymorphism of GPIIIa. Investigations with both 
platelets and stable cells lines have shown the PIA2 polymorphism is 
prothrombotic. Only a handful of studies have been performed for platelet GPla 
(integrin alpha2) and GPIb-IX-V, but there is support for the 807 T/C 
polymorphism of GPIa and the met145 and VNTR B/C genotype of GPIbalpha as risk 
factors in younger age groups. And isolated reports suggest other platelet 
polymorphisms (GPIIb, FcgammaRIIa, P-selectin, alpha2 adrenergic receptor, 
transforming growth factor [TGF]beta) are risk factors for arterial disease or 
produce a prothrombotic phenotype. Platelet glycoprotein polymorphisms should be 
added to the list of genetic risk factors for arterial thrombosis, particularly 
in younger patients and women.
