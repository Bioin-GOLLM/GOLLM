Recent advances in genetics and technology have led to breakthroughs in 
understanding the genes that predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases. A 
common haplotype of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 
(STAT4) gene has been shown to be associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid 
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and primary Sj√∂gren's syndrome. STAT4 
is a transcription factor that transduces interleukin-12, interleukin-23, and 
type 1 interferon cytokine signals in T cells and monocytes, leading to T-helper 
type 1 and T-helper type 17 differentiation, monocyte activation, and 
interferon-gamma production. Although the evidence for this association is very 
strong and well replicated, the exact mechanism by which polymorphisms in this 
gene lead to disease remains unknown. In concert with the identification of 
other disease-associated loci, elucidating how the variant form of STAT4 
modulates immune function should lead to an improved understanding of the 
pathophysiology of autoimmunity.
