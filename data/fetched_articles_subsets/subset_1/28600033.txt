OBJECTIVE: HLA-G is critically important for successful implantation during 
pregnancy. Increasing evidence supposed that HLA-G plays a key role in tolerance 
of the semi-allogeneic graft in pregnancy by inhibiting the cytotoxic functions 
of T and NK cells. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of HLA-G 
rs1063320 (+3142G>C) and 14-bp insertion (ins)/deletion (del) polymorphisms on 
recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from 93 RSA patients and 93 normal fertile 
women was isolated using the salting out method. Genotyping of HLA-G +3142G>C 
and 14-bp ins/del variants was done by polymerase chain reaction restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFP) and PCR method, respectively.
RESULTS: The HLA-G +3142G>C polymorphism increased the risk of RSA in codominant 
(OR = 2.39, 95%CI = 1.27-4.49, p = 0.010, GC vs GG; OR = 3.28, 
95%CI = 1.16-9.72, p = 0.040, CC vs GG) and dominant (OR = 2.52, 
95%CI = 1.37-4.64, p = 0.004, GC + CC vs GG) tested inheritance models. HLA-G 
rs1063320 C allele was associated with increased risk of RSA (OR = 1.84, 
95%CI = 1.20-2.83, p = 0.007). The del/del genotype as well as del allele of 
14-bp ins/del variant increased that risk of RSA (OR = 3.02, 95%CI = 1.23-7.41, 
p = 0.025 and OR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.09-2.50, p = 0.022, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In summary, our results showed that HLA-G gene polymorphisms 
significantly increased the risk of RSA in a sample of the Iranian population.
