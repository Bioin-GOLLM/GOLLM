Although several reports on male infertility suggest a relationship between 
chromosome 9 polymorphisms and infertility, the effects on the phenotype have 
not been extensively reported. In this study, an infertile patient was found to 
carry a 9qh+++ chromosome. The flow cytometric TUNEL assay and SCD test have 
been applied to characterize sperm DNA integrity. In order to assess its meiotic 
behaviour, synapsis, recombination, and aneuploidy, analyses have been also 
performed. Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) was 77.81% and 87% for the TUNEL and 
SCD tests, respectively. Ninety-two percent of pachytene cells analyzed showed 
meiotic abnormalities. The mean number of MLH1 foci per pachytene in the control 
group was higher (49) than the mean found in the 9qh+++ patient (38) (P < 
.0001). In spermatozoa, significant increases of disomy rates were observed for 
chromosome 18 and for the sex chromosomes (P < .0001). These disturbances could 
be present in other male carriers of a less marked 9qh+.
