PURPOSE: Pharmacological inhibition of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 
reduces R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels and restores cellular differentiation 
in vivo and in vitro. The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib (AG-221) has been approved 
by the FDA as a first-in-class inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed or 
refractory (R/R) IDH2-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, the 
effects of a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and AG-221 on AML 
cell differentiation was explored, along with the mechanisms employed by 
IDH2-mutant cells in AML.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated the human AML cell line, IDH2-mutant-TF-1, and 
primary human AML cells carrying IDH2 mutation with 30 μM AG-221 and 100 nM 
ATRA, alone or in combination.
RESULTS: Combined treatment with AG-221 and ATRA inhibited 2-HG production and 
resulted in synergistic effects on differentiation among IDH2-mutant AML cells 
and primary AML cells expressing IDH2 mutation. Combined treatment with AG-221 
and ATRA altered autophagic activity. AG-221 and ATRA treatment-induced 
differentiation of IDH2-mutant AML cells was associated with autophagy 
induction, without suppressing autophagy flux at maturation and degradation 
stages. A RAF-1/MEK/ERK pathway was founded to be associated with AG-221 and 
ATRA-induced differentiation in IDH2-mutant AML cells. IDH-associated changes in 
histone methylation markers decreased after AG-221 and ATRA combination 
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary evidence indicates that the addition of ATRA to 
treatments with IDH2 inhibitor may lead to further improvements or increases in 
response rates in IDH2-mutant AML patients who do not appear to benefit from 
treatments with IDH2 inhibitor alone.
