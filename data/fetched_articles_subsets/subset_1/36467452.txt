BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive 
neurodegenerative disease caused by the loss of motor neurons, and development 
of effective medicines is urgently required. Induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC)-based drug repurposing identified the Src/c-Abl inhibitor bosutinib, 
which is approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), as a 
candidate for the molecular targeted therapy of ALS.
METHODS: An open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation phase 1 study using a 3 + 3 
design was conducted in 4 hospitals in Japan to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of bosutinib in patients with ALS. Furthermore, the exploratory 
efficacy was evaluated using Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), 
predictive biomarkers including plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) were 
explored, and single-cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived motor neurons was 
conducted. Patients, whose total ALSFRS-R scores decreased by 1-3 points during 
the 12-week, received escalating doses starting from 100 mg quaque die (QD) up 
to 400 mg QD based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurrence, and all 
participants who received one dose of the study drug were included in the 
primary analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04744532, 
as Induced pluripotent stem cell-based Drug Repurposing for Amyotrophic Lateral 
Sclerosis Medicine (iDReAM) study.
FINDINGS: Between March 29, 2019 and May 7, 2021, 20 patients were enrolled, 13 
of whom received bosutinib treatment and 12 were included in the safety and 
efficacy analyses. No DLTs were observed up to 300 mg QD, but DLTs were observed 
in 3/3 patients of the 400 mg QD cohort. In all patients receiving 
100 mg-400 mg, the prevalent adverse events (AEs) were gastrointestinal AEs in 
12 patients (92.3%), liver function related AEs in 7 patients (53.8%), and rash 
in 3 patients (23.1%). The safety profile was consistent with that known for CML 
treatment, and ALS-specific AEs were not observed. A subset of patients (5/9 
patients) was found to respond well to bosutinib treatment over the 12-week 
treatment period. It was found that the treatment-responsive patients could be 
distinguished by their lower levels of plasma NFL. Furthermore, single-cell RNA 
sequencing of iPSC-derived motor neurons revealed the pathogenesis related 
molecular signature in patients with ALS showing responsiveness to bosutinib.
INTERPRETATION: This is the first trial of a Src/c-Abl inhibitor, bosutinib, for 
patients with ALS. The safety and tolerability of bosutinib up to 300 mg, not 
400 mg, in ALS were described, and responsiveness of patients on motor function 
was observed. Since this was an open-label trial within a short period with a 
limited number of patients, further clinical trials will be required.
