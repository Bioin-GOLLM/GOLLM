Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder with complex genetic, 
environmental, and psychological etiologies. Although DISC1 gene has been shown 
as a risk factor for schizophrenia in some reports, there is a lack of a 
consensus. We therefore performed separate meta-analyses aiming to assess the 
associations between DISC1 SNPs and schizophrenia risk. We found that SNP 
rs821597 is significantly associated with schizophrenia risk in terms of both 
allelic and genotypic distribution, while SNP rs821616 is associated with 
schizophrenia in terms of genotypic distribution, especially in cases above 40 
years old.
