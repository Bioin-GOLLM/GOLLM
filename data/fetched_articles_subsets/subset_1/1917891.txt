In order to determine the transactivation domain(s) of the rat estrogen receptor 
(rat ER), we made a number of rat ER deletion mutants and transfected the mutant 
plasmids into COS7 cells together with an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid, 
ERE-tk(197)-CAT, which contained the estrogen response element of Xenopus 
vitellogenin A2 gene. We have identified and localized the N-terminal 
transactivation domain of the rat ER to a hydrophobic region extending from Ala 
59 to Glu 140.
