Diffuse sclerosing variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (DSVPTC) is commonly 
observed in young patients, with a median age at diagnosis in the third decade 
of life. Further, the risk of recurrence is higher for DSVPTC than for classical 
PTC. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the clinicopathological and genetic 
characteristics of patients of different ages with DSVPTC. We retrospectively 
reviewed 397 patients who underwent thyroidectomy for DSVPTC at Gangnam 
Severance Hospital, Yonsei University, from January 2005 to December 2017. The 
mean age at diagnosis was 36.7 Â± 11.6 years, with most patients (163, 41.1%) 
aged 31-40 years. DSVPTC was predominant in women (276, 69.5%). We observed 
recurrence in 46 (11.6%) patients, with regional nodal recurrence being the most 
common type of recurrence (32 patients, 69.6%). The mean tumour size was larger 
in younger patients than in older patients. DSVPTC was more aggressive in 
paediatric patients with a larger-sized tumour, more common multiplicity, and 
lateral neck metastasis. Through random sampling, we selected 41 patients by age 
group and examined the mutations in 119 genes using next-generation sequencing. 
BRAF, KRAS, and TERT displayed relatively higher mutation rates than other 
genes. DSVPTC displays different clinical, pathological, and molecular profiles 
than classical PTC. The BRAF, KRAS, and TERT mutations are the most important, 
with age-specific differences.
