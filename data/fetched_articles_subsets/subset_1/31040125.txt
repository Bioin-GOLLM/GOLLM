To address the need for improved systemic therapy for non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), we previously demonstrated that mesenchymal NSCLC was sensitive to 
polo-like kinase (Plk1) inhibitors, but the mechanisms of resistance in 
epithelial NSCLC remain unknown. Here, we show that cMet was differentially 
regulated in isogenic pairs of epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines. Plk1 
inhibition inhibits cMet phosphorylation only in mesenchymal cells. 
Constitutively active cMet abrogates Plk1 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Likewise, 
cMet silencing or inhibition enhances Plk1 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Cells 
with acquired resistance to Plk1 inhibitors are more epithelial than their 
parental cells and maintain cMet activation after Plk1 inhibition. In four 
animal NSCLC models, mesenchymal tumors were more sensitive to Plk1 inhibition 
alone than were epithelial tumors. The combination of cMet and Plk1 inhibition 
led to regression of tumors that did not regrow when drug treatment was stopped. 
Plk1 inhibition did not affect HGF levels but did decrease vimentin 
phosphorylation, which regulates cMet phosphorylation via β1-integrin. This 
research defines a heretofore unknown mechanism of ligand-independent activation 
of cMet downstream of Plk1 and an effective combination therapy.
