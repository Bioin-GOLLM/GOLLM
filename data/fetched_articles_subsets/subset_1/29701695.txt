The leaves of Morus alba L. are an important herbal medicine in Asia. The 
systematic isolation of the metabolites of the leaves of Morus alba L. was 
achieved using a combination of liquid chromatography techniques. The structures 
were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis and the absolute configuration 
was determined based on electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopic data 
and hydrolysis experiments. Their biological activity was evaluated using 
different biological assays, such as the assessment of their capacity to inhibit 
the aldose reductase enzyme; the determination of their cytotoxic activity and 
the evaluation of their neuroprotective effects against the deprivation of serum 
or against the presence of nicouline. Chemical investigation of the leaves of 
Morus alba L. resulted in four new structures 1⁻4 and a known molecule 5. 
Compounds 2 and 5 inhibited aldose reductase with IC50 values of 4.33 μM and 6.0 
μM compared with the potent AR inhibitor epalrestat (IC50 1.88 × 10−3 μM). 
Pretreatment with compound 3 decreased PC12 cell apoptosis subsequent serum 
deprivation condition and pretreatment with compound 5 decreased 
nicouline-induced PC12 cell apoptosis as compared with control cells (p < 
0.001).
