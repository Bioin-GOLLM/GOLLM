Antimicrobial peptides can be used as therapeutic agents against cancer cells. 
Warnericin RK and derivatives (WarnG20D and WarnF14V) were tested on various, 
solid tumor or leukemia, cancer cells. These peptides appeared to be cytotoxic 
on all the cell types tested, cancerous as well healthy, but very interestingly 
displayed no deleterious effect on healthy mononuclear cells. The mode of action 
of the peptide was proposed to be membranolytic, using chemical Raman imaging. 
Addition of peptide induced a large disorganization of the membrane leading to 
the loss of the content of inner compartments of Jurkat cell, whereas no effect 
was observed on the healthy mononuclear cells. The less hemolytic peptides 
WarnG20D and WarnF14V could be good candidates for the leukemia treatment.
