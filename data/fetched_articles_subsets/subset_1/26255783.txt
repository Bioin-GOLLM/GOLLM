PURPOSE: Drug abuse is a major risk factor in the development and progression of 
HIV-1. This study defines the alterations in the plasma proteome of 
HIV-1-infected women that use cocaine.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Plasma samples from 12 HIV-seropositive Hispanic women 
under antiretroviral therapy were selected for this study. Six sample pairs were 
matched between nondrug users and cocaine users. After IgG and albumin 
depletion, SDS-PAGE, and in-gel digestion, peptides from nondrug users and 
cocaine users were labeled with (16) O and (18) O, respectively, and subjected 
to LC-MS/MS and quantitation using Proteome Discover and QuiXoT softwares and 
validated by ELISA.
RESULTS: A total of 1015 proteins were identified at 1% false discovery rates 
(FDR). Statistical analyses revealed 13 proteins with significant changes 
between the two groups, cocaine and noncocaine users (p < 0.05). The great 
majority pertained to protection defense function and the rest pertained to 
transport, homeostatic, regulation, and binding of ligands. Apolipoprotein CIII 
was increased in plasma of HIV+ Hispanic women positive for cocaine compared to 
HIV+ nondrug users (p ≤ 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increased human apolipoprotein CIII warrants 
that these patients be carefully monitored to avoid the increased risk of 
cardiovascular events associated with HIV, HAART, and cocaine use.
