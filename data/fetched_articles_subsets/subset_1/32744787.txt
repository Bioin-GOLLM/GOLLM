Mutations in the MBOAT7 gene have been described in 43 patients, belonging to 18 
families, showing nonspecific clinical features (intellectual disability [ID], 
seizures, microcephaly or macrocephaly, and mild to moderate cerebellar atrophy) 
that make the clinical diagnosis difficult. Here we report the first Italian 
patient, a 22.5-year-old female, one of the oldest reported, born to apparently 
consanguineous parents. She shows severe ID, macrocephaly, seizures, aggressive 
outbursts, hyperphagia. We also documented progressive atrophy of the cerebellar 
vermis, that appeared not before the age of 7. The whole-exome sequencing of the 
trio identified a novel homozygous variant c.1057_1058delGCinsCA (p.Ala353His) 
in the MBOAT7 gene. The variant is considered to be likely pathogenic, since it 
is absent from population database and it lies in a highly conserved amino acid 
residue. This disorder has a neurometabolic pathogenesis, implicating a 
phospholipid remodeling abnormalities. A brain hydrogen-magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (H-MRS) examination in our patient disclosed a peculiar 
neurometabolic profile in the cerebellar hemispheric region. This new finding 
could address the clinical suspicion of MBOAT7-related disorder, among the wide 
range of genetic conditions associated with ID and cerebellar atrophy. Moreover, 
the documented progression of cerebellar atrophy and the worsening of the 
disease only after some years open to the possibility of a therapeutic window 
after birth.
