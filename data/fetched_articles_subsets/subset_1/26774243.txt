BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum threatens to reduce 
the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), thus compromising 
global efforts to eliminate malaria. Recent treatment failures with 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, the current first-line ACT in Cambodia, suggest 
that piperaquine resistance may be emerging in this country. We explored the 
relation between artemisinin resistance and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
failures, and sought to confirm the presence of piperaquine-resistant P 
falciparum infections in Cambodia.
METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled patients aged 2-65 years 
with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in three Cambodian provinces: Pursat, 
Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri. Participants were given standard 3-day courses of 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Peripheral blood parasite densities were 
measured until parasites cleared and then weekly to 63 days. The primary outcome 
was recrudescent P falciparum parasitaemia within 63 days. We measured 
piperaquine plasma concentrations at baseline, 7 days, and day of recrudescence. 
We assessed phenotypic and genotypic markers of drug resistance in parasite 
isolates. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01736319.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 4, 2012, and Dec 31, 2013, we enrolled 241 participants. 
In Pursat, where artemisinin resistance is entrenched, 37 (46%) of 81 patients 
had parasite recrudescence. In Preah Vihear, where artemisinin resistance is 
emerging, ten (16%) of 63 patients had recrudescence and in Ratanakiri, where 
artemisinin resistance is rare, one (2%) of 60 patients did. Patients with 
recrudescent P falciparum infections were more likely to have detectable 
piperaquine plasma concentrations at baseline compared with non-recrudescent 
patients, but did not differ significantly in age, initial parasite density, or 
piperaquine plasma concentrations at 7 days. Recrudescent parasites had a higher 
prevalence of kelch13 mutations, higher piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentration 
(IC50) values, and lower mefloquine IC50 values; none had multiple pfmdr1 
copies, a genetic marker of mefloquine resistance.
INTERPRETATION: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failures are caused by both 
artemisinin and piperaquine resistance, and commonly occur in places where 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine has been used in the private sector. In Cambodia, 
artesunate plus mefloquine may be a viable option to treat 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failures, and a more effective first-line ACT in 
areas where dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failures are common. The use of 
single low-dose primaquine to eliminate circulating gametocytes is needed in 
areas where artemisinin and ACT resistance is prevalent.
