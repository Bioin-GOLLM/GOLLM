Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an 
outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a major threat to public 
health worldwide. Previous studies have shown that the spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 determines viral infectivity and major antigenicity. However, the 
spike protein has been undergoing various mutations, which bring a great 
challenge to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here we present the 
MutCov, a pipeline for evaluating the effect of mutations in spike protein on 
infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 by calculating the binding free 
energy between spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or 
neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb). The predicted infectivity and 
antigenicity were highly consistent with biologically experimental results, and 
demonstrated that the MutCov achieved good prediction performance. In 
conclusion, the MutCov is of high importance for systematically evaluating the 
effect of novel mutations and improving the prevention and treatment of 
COVID-19. The source code and installation instruction of MutCov are freely 
available at http://jianglab.org.cn/MutCov.
