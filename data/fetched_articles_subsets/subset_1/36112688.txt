Lipids are crucial components of cellular function owing to their role in 
membrane formation, intercellular signaling, energy storage, and homeostasis 
maintenance. In the brain, lipid dysregulations have been associated with the 
etiology and progression of neurodegeneration and other neurological 
pathologies. Hence, brain lipids are emerging as important potential targets for 
the early diagnosis and prognosis of neurological diseases. This review aims to 
highlight the significance and usefulness of lipidomics in diagnosing and 
treating brain diseases. We explored lipid alterations associated with brain 
diseases, paying attention to organ-specific characteristics and the functions 
of brain lipids. As the recent advances in brain lipidomics would have been 
impossible without advances in analytical techniques, we provide up-to-date 
information on mass spectrometric approaches and integrative analysis with other 
omic approaches. Last, we present the potential applications of lipidomics 
combined with artificial intelligence techniques and interdisciplinary 
collaborative research for treating brain diseases with clinical 
heterogeneities.
