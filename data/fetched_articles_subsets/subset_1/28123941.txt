OBJECTIVE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of 
diverse biological processes. Recent work has demonstrated that the inducible 
lncRNA Blnc1 stimulates thermogenic gene expression during brown and beige 
adipocyte differentiation. However, whether Blnc1 is functionally conserved in 
humans has not been explored. In addition, the molecular basis of the Blnc1 
ribonucleoprotein complex in thermogenic gene induction remains incompletely 
understood. The aims of the current study were to: i) investigate functional 
conservation of Blnc1 in mice and humans and ii) elucidate the molecular 
mechanisms by which Blnc1 controls the thermogenic gene program in brown 
adipocytes.
METHODS: Full-length human Blnc1 was cloned and examined for its ability to 
stimulate brown adipocyte differentiation. Different truncation mutants of Blnc1 
were generated to identify functional RNA domains responsible for thermogenic 
gene induction. RNA-protein interaction studies were performed to delineate the 
molecular features of the Blnc1 ribonucleoprotein complex.
RESULTS: Blnc1 is highly conserved in mice and humans at the sequence and 
function levels, both capable of stimulating brown adipocyte gene expression. A 
conserved RNA domain was identified to be required and sufficient for the 
biological activity of Blnc1. We identified hnRNPU as an RNA-binding protein 
that facilitates the assembly and augments the transcriptional function of the 
Blnc1/EBF2 ribonucleoprotein complex.
CONCLUSIONS: Blnc1 is a conserved lncRNA that promotes thermogenic gene 
expression in brown adipocytes through formation of the Blnc1/hnRNPU/EBF2 
ribonucleoprotein complex.
