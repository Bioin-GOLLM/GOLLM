Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators of intercellular 
communication. However, EV biogenesis remains poorly understood. We previously 
defined a role for Arrdc4 (Arrestin domain containing protein 4), an adaptor for 
Nedd4 family ubiquitin ligases, in the biogenesis of EVs. Here we report that 
ubiquitination of Arrdc4 is critical for its role in EV secretion. We identified 
five potential ubiquitinated lysine residues in Arrdc4 using mass spectrometry. 
By analysing Arrdc4 lysine mutants we discovered that lysine 270 (K270) is 
critical for Arrdc4 function in EV biogenesis. Arrdc4K270R mutation caused a 
decrease in the number of EVs released by cells compared to Arrdc4WT , and a 
reduction in trafficking of divalent metal transporter (DMT1) into EVs. 
Furthermore, we also observed a decrease in DMT1 activity and an increase in its 
intracellular degradation in the presence of Arrdc4K270R . K270 was found to be 
ubiquitinated with K-29 polyubiquitin chains by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2. 
Thus, our results uncover a novel role of K-29 polyubiquitin chains in 
Arrdc4-mediated EV biogenesis and protein trafficking.
