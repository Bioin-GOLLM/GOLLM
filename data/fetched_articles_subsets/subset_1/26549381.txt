mutations.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the genetic cause of the patients with non-syndromic 
enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) but without bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations.
METHODS: Presence of a homozygous genomic deletion was detected in a Chinese Han 
deaf patient (D1467-1) who failed to amplify the first three exons of SLC26A4. 
The breakpoints of the deletion were fine-mapped and revealed by PCR 
amplification and sequencing. This deletion was subsequently screened in 22 
Chinese Han EVA probands with mono-allelic SLC26A4 mutations. The possible 
founder effect of the newly identified genomic deletion was evaluated by 
haplotype analysis.
RESULTS: A homozygous c.-2071_307+3801del7666 deletion of SLC26A4 was identified 
in patient D1467-1. This novel genomic deletion was subsequently identified in 
18% (4/22) of the Chinese Han EVA probands with mono-allelic SLC26A4 mutations. 
Haplotype analysis showed that this genomic deletion is likely a founder 
mutation in Chinese Hans.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the cryptic c.-2071_307+3801del7666 
deletion of SLC26A4 is relatively frequent in Chinese Han non-syndromic EVA 
patients without bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations. Screening of this genomic 
deletion should be incorporated into the routine DNA testing of SLC26A4 in 
Chinese Hans.
