OBJECTIVE: Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene was hypothesized to have a 
relationship with human prefrontal cortex (PFC) function and individual 
cognitive abilities. The object of this study was to investigate the possible 
impact of genotypes of COMT Val158Met polymorphism on cognitive ability among 
children living in the Qinba region in China.
METHOD: A total of 305 children were included, 163 girls and 142 boys; both 
complete IQ evaluation and Val158Met genotyping results were obtained. The 
quantitative traits of psychometric IQ were calculated by using the Chinese 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. All subjects' genotypes of COMT gene 
Val158Met polymorphism were identified with the restriction fragment length 
polymorphism method.
RESULTS: The F test showed that the average scores (including the Full Scale IQ, 
Verbal Scale IQ, Performance Scale IQ and three index scores) did not 
significantly differ among different groups defined by Val158Met genotypes, 
neither in boys nor in the total group (p > 0.05). There was a significant 
difference between the average of Freedom from Distractibility score among 
different genotypes found in girls (p = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that COMT gene Val158Met polymorphism may be 
related to the intelligence of Chinese girls, although the results cannot 
withstand multiple testing. Consequently, further studies with larger samples 
and perfect design still need place more emphasis on the gender difference and 
compensation effect of dopamine activity in PFC.
