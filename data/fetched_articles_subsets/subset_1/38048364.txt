Circadian regulation of gene expression is prevalent and plays critical roles in 
cell differentiation. However, its roles in the reprogramming of differentiated 
cells remain largely unknown. Here, we found that one of the master circadian 
regulators PER1 promoted virus-mediated reprogramming of mouse embryonic 
fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced neurons (iNs) and induced pluripotent stem cells 
(iPSCs). Unexpectedly, PER1 achieved this by repressing inflammatory activation 
of contaminating macrophages in the MEF culture, rather than by directly 
modulating the reprogrammability of MEFs. More specifically, we found that 
transduced viruses activated inflammatory genes in macrophages, such as Tnf 
encoding TNFα, one of the central inflammatory regulators and an autocrine 
activator of macrophages. TNFα inhibited iN reprogramming, whereas a TNFα 
inhibitor promoted iN reprogramming, connecting the inflammatory responses to iN 
reprogramming. In addition, macrophages were induced to proliferate and mature 
by non-macrophage cells serving as feeders, which also supported up-regulation 
of TNFα in macrophages without virus transduction. Furthermore, the 2 
inflammatory responses were repressed by the circadian regulator PER1 in 
macrophages, making reprogrammability dependent on time-of-day of virus 
transduction. Similar results were obtained with iPSC reprogramming, suggesting 
a wide occurrence of macrophage-mediated inhibition of cell reprogramming. This 
study uncovers mechanistic links between cell reprogramming, bystander 
inflammatory macrophages, and circadian rhythms, which are particularly relevant 
to in vivo reprogramming and organoid formation incorporating immune cells.
