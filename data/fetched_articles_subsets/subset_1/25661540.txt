OBJECTIVES: Gout is a polygenic auto-inflammatory disease, in which inflammation 
plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. The cytokine interleukin 
(IL)-23 promotes inflammation and helps to guide inflammatory cells, while 
studies have shown that the IL-23R gene is associated with susceptibility to 
several immune-related diseases. This study aimed to determine whether the 
IL-23R rs7517847 (G/T) polymorphism is associated with gout in a Chinese Han 
male population.
METHODS: We recruited 400 patients with gout and 582 gout-free controls. After 
obtaining blood samples for DNA extraction, genotyping of the rs7517847 
polymorphism was performed by fluorescence-based quantitative PCR using TaqMan 
probes. An association analysis was carried out using the χ(2) test. A 
genotype-phenotype analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: Both genotypic and allelic frequencies of rs7517847 differed 
significantly between gout patients and controls (χ(2) = 6.792, df = 2, P = 
0.034 by genotype; χ(2) = 4.202, df = 1, P = 0.04 by allele).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-23R may be associated with gout in a Chinese Han male 
population, although our findings should be confirmed using larger sample sizes 
and other independent populations.
