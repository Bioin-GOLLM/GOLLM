We conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the correlations of 
ezrin expression with pathological characteristics and the prognosis of 
osteosarcoma. The MEDLINE (1966-2013), the Cochrane Library Database, EMBASE, 
CINAHL, Web of Science (1945-2013), and the Chinese Biomedical Database were 
searched without language restrictions. Meta-analyses conducted using STATA 
software were calculated. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, including 459 
patients with osteosarcoma. Meta-analysis results illustrated that ezrin 
expression may be closely associated with the recurrence of osteosarcoma or 
metastasis in osteosarcoma. Our findings also demonstrated that patients with 
grade III-IV osteosarcoma showed a higher frequency of ezrin expression than 
those with histological grade I-II osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we found that 
patients with positive expression of ezrin exhibited a shorter overall survival 
than those with negative ezrin expression. The results also indicated that 
positive ezrin expression was strongly correlated with poorer metastasis-free 
survival. Nevertheless, no significant relationships were observed between ezrin 
expression and clinical variables (age and gender). In the current 
meta-analysis, our results illustrated significant relationships of ezrin 
expression with pathological characteristics and prognosis of osteosarcoma. 
Thus, ezrin expression could be a promising marker in predicting the clinical 
outcome of patients with osteosarcoma.
