The hepatic uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) are critical 
for detoxifying endo- and xenobiotics. Since UGTs are also dynamically 
responsive to endogenous and exogenous stimuli, we examined whether epigenetic 
DNA methylation can regulate hepatic UGT expression and differential effects of 
ethnicity, obesity, and sex. The methylation status of UGT isoforms was 
determined with Illumina Methylation 450 BeadChip arrays, with genotyping 
confirmed by sequencing and gene expression confirmed with quantitative reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR). The UGT1A3 mRNA was 2-fold 
higher in females than males (p < 0.05), while UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 mRNA were 
significantly higher in Pacific Islanders than Caucasians (both p < 0.05). 
Differential mRNA or methylation did not occur with obesity. The methylation of 
the UGT2B15 locus cg09189601 in Caucasians was significantly lower than the 
highly methylated locus in Asians (p < 0.001). Three intergenic loci between 
UGT2B15 and 2B17 (cg07973162, cg10632656, and cg07952421) showed higher rates of 
methylation in Caucasians than in Asians (p < 0.001). Levels of UGT2B15 and 
UGT2B17 mRNA were significantly lower in Asians than Caucasians (p = 0.01 and p 
< 0.001, respectively). Genotyping and sequencing indicated that only UGT2B15 is 
regulated by methylation, and low UGT2B17 mRNA is due to a deletion genotype 
common to Asians. Epigenetic regulation of UGT2B15 may predispose Asians to 
altered drug and hormone metabolism and begin to explain the increased risks for 
adverse drug reactions and some cancers in this population.
