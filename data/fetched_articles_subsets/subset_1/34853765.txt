There are indications that the frequency of cyst formation is increased in 
mitochondrial disorders (MIDs). Cysts can be found in various organs of MID 
patients but tongue root cysts have not been reported as a manifestation of a 
MID. In a 56-year-old male with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, 
and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) manifesting with recurrent stroke-like 
episodes, seizures, cognitive impairment, ataxia, psychiatric abnormalities, 
bilateral visual impairment, bilateral hypoacusis, pre-diabetes, hyperlipidemia, 
myopathy, and lactic acidosis, an asymptomatic, pre-epiglottic cyst with 1 cm in 
diameter and protein-rich content in the right tongue root was accidentally 
detected on ultrasound and confirmed by MRI at the age of 50 years. The patient 
did not complain about dysarthria or dysphagia but had a mild cerebellar speech. 
The cyst was confirmed on an MRI six years later, without having changed in 
diameter, extension, or symptomatology. Due to the atypical location, a 
branchiogenic cyst was excluded. In conclusion, tongue root cysts may be a 
manifestation of the m.3243A>G variant.
