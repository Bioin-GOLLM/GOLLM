Activation of the serum-resident complement system begins a cascade that leads 
to activation of membrane-resident complement receptors on immune cells, thus 
coordinating serum and cellular immune responses. Whilst many molecules act to 
control inappropriate activation, Properdin is the only known positive regulator 
of the human complement system. By stabilising the alternative pathway C3 
convertase it promotes complement self-amplification and persistent activation 
boosting the magnitude of the serum complement response by all triggers. In this 
work, we identify a family of tick-derived alternative pathway complement 
inhibitors, hereafter termed CirpA. Functional and structural characterisation 
reveals that members of the CirpA family directly bind to properdin, inhibiting 
its ability to promote complement activation, and leading to potent inhibition 
of the complement response in a species specific manner. We provide a full 
functional and structural characterisation of a properdin inhibitor, opening 
avenues for future therapeutic approaches.
