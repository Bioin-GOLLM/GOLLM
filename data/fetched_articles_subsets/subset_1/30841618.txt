Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a disorder of the central myelin that is 
often associated with a precipitous rise of serum sodium. Remarkably, while the 
myelin and oligodendrocytes of specific brain areas degenerate during the 
disease, neighboring neurons and axons appear unspoiled, and neuroinflammation 
appears only once demyelination is well established. In addition to blood‒brain 
barrier breakdown and microglia activation, astrocyte death is among one of the 
earliest events during ODS pathology. This review will focus on various aspects 
of biochemical, molecular and cellular aspects of oligodendrocyte and astrocyte 
changes in ODS-susceptible brain regions, with an emphasis on the crosstalk 
between those two glial cells. Emerging evidence pointing to the initiating role 
of astrocytes in region-specific degeneration are discussed.
