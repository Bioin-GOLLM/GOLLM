Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the RAC1 (Rac family small GTPase 1) 
gene have recently been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hyperglycemia due to 
their contribution to impaired redox homeostasis. The present study was designed 
to determine whether the common SNPs of the RAC1 gene are associated with 
diabetic complications such as neuropathy (DN), retinopathy (DR), nephropathy, 
angiopathy of the lower extremities (DA), and diabetic foot syndrome. A total of 
1470 DNA samples from T2D patients were genotyped for six common SNPs by the 
MassArray Analyzer-4 system. The genotype rs7784465-T/C of RAC1 was associated 
with an increased risk of DR (p = 0.016) and DA (p = 0.03) in males, as well as 
with DR in females (p = 0.01). Furthermore, the SNP rs836478 showed an 
association with DR (p = 0.005) and DN (p = 0.025) in males, whereas the SNP 
rs10238136 was associated with DA in females (p = 0.002). In total, three RAC1 
haplotypes showed significant associations (FDR < 0.05) with T2D complications 
in a sex-specific manner. The study's findings demonstrate, for the first time, 
that the RAC1 gene's polymorphisms represent novel and sex-specific markers of 
neuropathy and microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, and that the gene 
could be a new target for the pharmacological inhibition of oxidative stress as 
a means of preventing diabetic complications.
