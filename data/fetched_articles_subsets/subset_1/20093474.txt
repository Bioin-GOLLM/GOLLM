Current methods for differentiating isolates of predominant lineages of 
pathogenic bacteria often do not provide sufficient resolution to define precise 
relationships. Here, we describe a high-throughput genomics approach that 
provides a high-resolution view of the epidemiology and microevolution of a 
dominant strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This 
approach reveals the global geographic structure within the lineage, its 
intercontinental transmission through four decades, and the potential to trace 
person-to-person transmission within a hospital environment. The ability to 
interrogate and resolve bacterial populations is applicable to a range of 
infectious diseases, as well as microbial ecology.
