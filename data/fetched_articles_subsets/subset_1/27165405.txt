The venoms of spiders and scorpions contain a variety of chemical compounds. 
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from these organisms were first discovered in the 
1990s. As of May 2015, there were 42 spider's and 63 scorpion's AMPs in the 
Antimicrobial Peptide Database (http://aps.unmc.edu/AP). These peptides have 
demonstrated broad or narrow-spectrum activities against bacteria, fungi, 
viruses, and parasites. In addition, they can be toxic to cancer cells, insects 
and erythrocytes. To provide insight into such an activity spectrum, this 
article discusses the discovery, classification, structure and activity 
relationships, bioinformatics analysis, and potential applications of spider and 
scorpion AMPs. Our analysis reveals that, in the case of linear peptides, 
spiders use both glycine-rich and helical peptide models for defense, whereas 
scorpions use two distinct helical peptide models with different amino acid 
compositions to exert the observed antimicrobial activities and hemolytic 
toxicity. Our structural bioinformatics study improves the knowledge in the 
field and can be used to design more selective peptides to combat tumors, 
parasites, and viruses.
