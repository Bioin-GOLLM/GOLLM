Mucin-domain glycoproteins are densely O-glycosylated and play critical roles in 
a host of biological functions. In particular, the T cell immunoglobulin and 
mucin-domain containing family of proteins (TIM-1, -3, -4) decorate immune cells 
and act as key regulators in cellular immunity. However, their dense 
O-glycosylation remains enigmatic, primarily due to the challenges associated 
with studying mucin domains. Here, we demonstrate that the mucinase SmE has a 
unique ability to cleave at residues bearing very complex glycans. SmE enables 
improved mass spectrometric analysis of several mucins, including the entire TIM 
family. With this information in-hand, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations of TIM-3 and -4 to understand how glycosylation affects structural 
features of these proteins. Finally, we use these models to investigate the 
functional relevance of glycosylation for TIM-3 function and ligand binding. 
Overall, we present a powerful workflow to better understand the detailed 
molecular structures and functions of the mucinome.
