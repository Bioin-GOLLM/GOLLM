Entry of enveloped viruses into cells is mediated by fusogenic proteins that 
form a complex between membranes to drive rearrangements needed for fusion. 
Skeletal muscle development also requires membrane fusion events between 
progenitor cells to form multinucleated myofibers. Myomaker and Myomerger are 
muscle-specific cell fusogens, but do not structurally or functionally resemble 
classical viral fusogens. We asked if the muscle fusogens could functionally 
substitute for viral fusogens, despite their structural distinctiveness, and 
fuse viruses to cells. We report that engineering of Myomaker and Myomerger on 
the membrane of enveloped viruses leads to specific transduction of skeletal 
muscle. We also demonstrate that locally and systemically injected virions 
pseudotyped with the muscle fusogens can deliver micro-Dystrophin (μDys) to 
skeletal muscle of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Through 
harnessing the intrinsic properties of myogenic membranes, we establish a 
platform for delivery of therapeutic material to skeletal muscle.
