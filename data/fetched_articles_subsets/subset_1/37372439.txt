We have shown that lipid-associated loci discovered by genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) have pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism, carotid 
intima-media thickness (CIMT), and CAD risk. Here, we investigated the impact of 
lipid-associated GWAS loci on the efficacy of rosuvastatin therapy in terms of 
changes in plasma lipid levels and CIMT. The study comprised 116 CAD patients 
with hypercholesterolemia. CIMT, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were measured at baseline and after 
6 and 12 months of follow-up, respectively. Genotyping of fifteen 
lipid-associated GWAS loci was performed by the MassArray-4 System. Linear 
regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, and rosuvastatin 
dose was used to estimate the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms, and p-values 
were calculated through adaptive permutation tests by the PLINK software, v1.9. 
Over one-year rosuvastatin therapy, a decrease in CIMT was linked to rs1689800, 
rs4846914, rs12328675, rs55730499, rs9987289, rs11220463, rs16942887, and 
rs881844 polymorphisms (Pperm < 0.05). TC change was associated with rs55730499, 
rs11220463, and rs6065906; LDL-C change was linked to the rs55730499, rs1689800, 
and rs16942887 polymorphisms; and TG change was linked to polymorphisms rs838880 
and rs1883025 (Pperm < 0.05). In conclusion, polymorphisms rs1689800, 
rs55730499, rs11220463, and rs16942887 were found to be predictive markers for 
multiple antiatherogenic effects of rosuvastatin in CAD patients.
