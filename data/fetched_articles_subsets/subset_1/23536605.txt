AIMS: The ClC-3 chloride channel (and current, ICl,ClC-3) plays an important 
role in cell volume regulation, proliferation, and apoptosis in vascular smooth 
muscle cells, and is a potential target for prevention of vascular remodelling 
and stroke. However, modulation of ICl,ClC-3 by intercellular signalling is not 
fully understood. Although it has been suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation 
is required for ICl,ClC-3 activation, the potential tyrosine residues in the 
ClC-3 protein are not clear. In the present study, the critical tyrosine 
residues in ClC-3 protein were investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Site-specific mutagenesis, immunoprecipitation, patch 
clamp, and Cl(-) transport imaging techniques were employed. We found that 
activation of ICl,ClC-3 was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the 
ClC-3 protein. Three potential tyrosine residues, Y284, Y572, and Y631, were 
mutated to phenylalanine, and only mutation, at Y284 within a consensus 
Src-phosphorylation site, completely blocked ICl,ClC-3. Phosphomimetic mutation 
Y284D increased the Cl(-) current and Cl(-) efflux mediated by ClC-3. The Y284F 
mutation completely abolished the protective effect of ClC-3 on apoptosis, 
whereas the Y284D mutation potentiated it. There was an interaction between Src 
kinase and ClC-3 protein, and the Y284D mutation abrogated the inhibitory effect 
of SU6656, a Src family kinase inhibitor, on ClC-3 Cl(-) current.
CONCLUSION: Tyrosine 284 phosphorylation in the ClC-3 channel targeted by Src 
kinase is an important molecular mechanism for ClC-3 channel activation.
