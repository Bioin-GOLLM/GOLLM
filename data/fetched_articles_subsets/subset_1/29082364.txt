BACKGROUND: Metformin reduces maternal and neonatal weight gain in gestational 
diabetes mellitus; however, this effect is poorly investigated in non-diabetic 
women.
OBJECTIVE: We performed this meta-analysis to investigate the effect of 
metformin intake during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese 
non-diabetic women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL for 
eligible randomized controlled trials addressing the efficacy of metformin in 
pregnant obese non-diabetic women. Data were extracted and analyzed using RevMan 
software (Version 5.3). Neonatal birth weight was the key outcome. Secondary 
outcomes included maternal weight gain, the incidence of preeclampsia, and 
neonatal adverse effects (miscarriage, stillbirth and congenital anomalies).
RESULTS: Pooled data from two RCTs (n=843) showed that metformin caused a 
significant reduction in maternal gestational weight gain (MD-1.35, 95% CI: 
[2.08, -0.630]), compared to placebo. The summary effect-estimate did not favor 
either of the two groups in terms of reduction of neonatal birth weight Z score 
(MD-0.09, 95% CI: [0.23, 0.06]). Metformin was associated with 41% reduction in 
the risk of preeclampsia; however, this reduction was not statistically 
significant [RR 0.59, 95% CI: [0.03, 11.46]). None of the neonatal adverse 
events including stillbirth [RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.42, 3.10]) and congenital 
anomalies (RR= 1.36, 95% CI: [0.58, 3.21]) differed significantly between the 
two groups.
CONCLUSION: For obese pregnant women, metformin could decrease gestational 
weight gain with no significant reduction in neonatal birth weight. In light of 
the current evidence, metformin should not be used to prevent poor pregnancy 
outcomes in obese non-diabetic women.
