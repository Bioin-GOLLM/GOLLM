Lymphotoxin-a (LTA) may be associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory 
diseases. To assess the association of the LTA rs909253 A/G polymorphism with 
plasma level and risk of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a Chinese Han 
population. Genotyping and LTA plasma were tested by mass spectroscopy and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The results showed that 
the average plasma level of LTA in AS was significantly lower than in the 
controls (P = 0.000). Our results also indicated that LTA rs909253 A/G was 
associated with a decreased risk of AS (G vs. A: P = 0.014). Significant 
differences were also found between the rs909253 A/G genotype and down-regulated 
plasma level in AS patients, compared with controls. After stratification 
analysis, a decreased risk of AS was associated with the LTA rs909253 G allele 
(G vs. A) among female patients, younger patients (Yr. < 30), HLA-B27-positive 
patients. In addition, In conclusion, LTA rs909253 A/G genotype has a 
significant relationship with decreased susceptibility to AS.
