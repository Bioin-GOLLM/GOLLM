PURPOSE: The research of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has become a new passion 
with the discovery of abundant new lncRNAs and extensive investigation of their 
roles in various diseases, especially in cancers. Metastasis associated in lung 
adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) emerges as a hotspot, which has been 
reported to be involved in dysregulation of cell signaling and closely 
correlated with cancer development, progression, and response to therapy. This 
review is a brief update of the current knowledge related to the role of MALAT1 
in cancer-associated molecular pathways and pathophysiology and possible 
determinants for MALAT1 to function as a biomarker, aiming to stimulate the 
basic investigation of lncRNA MALAT1 as well as its translation to clinical 
applications.
METHODS: We have selected vast literature from electronic databases including 
studies associated with its clinical significance and the pivotal functions in 
cancer processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, immunity, 
angiogenesis, and drug resistance.
RESULTS: Studies have shown that aberrant expression of MALAT1 is related to 
cancer pathophysiology with the potential to be translated clinically and MALAT1 
can regulate cancer processes by interacting with molecules, such as proteins, 
RNAs and DNAs, and further altering different signal pathways.
CONCLUSION: MALAT1 lncRNA promises to be a potential biomarker for cancer 
diagnosis as well as prognosis. Additionally, it might be a therapeutic target 
for human cancers.
