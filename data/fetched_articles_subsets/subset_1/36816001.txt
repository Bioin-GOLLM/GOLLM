Macrominerals play vital roles in a multitude of physiologic systems. A myriad 
of biochemical reactions are dependent on or affected by these electrolytes. The 
current review attempts to identify the role of macrominerals as calcium, 
phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium and sulfur in human health, in addition 
to their absorption and homeostasis inside the body. We also focused on their 
amount in major food sources and the recommended daily intake of each 
macromineral. In addition, a deep insight into the orchestration of the 6 
different macrominerals' requirements is presented across the human life cycle, 
beginning from fertility and pregnancy, and reaching adulthood and senility, 
with insight on interactions among them and underlying action mechanisms. The 
effect of sex is also presented for each mineral at each life stage to highlight 
the different daily requirements and/ or effects. The current review identified 
the role of macrominerals in human health, in addition to their absorption and 
homeostasis in the body. Based on the in-depth understanding of the factors 
influencing the metabolism of macrominerals, we could better explore their 
safety and possible therapeutic potential in specific disorders. There is still 
a need to precisely demonstrate the bioavailability of macrominerals from 
various types of functional food.
