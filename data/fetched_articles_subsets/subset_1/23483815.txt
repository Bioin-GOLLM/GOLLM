INTRODUCTION: Myotonia Congenita is an inherited myotonia that is due to a 
mutation in the skeletal muscle chloride channel CLCN1. These mutations lead to 
reduced sarcolemmal chloride conductance, causing delayed muscle relaxation that 
is evident as clinical and electrical myotonia.
METHODS: We report the clinical presentations of two individuals with Myotonia 
Congenita (MC).
RESULTS: Patient 1 has been diagnosed with the recessive form of MC, known as 
the Becker variant, and Patient 2 has been diagnosed with the dominant form of 
MC, known as the Thomsen variant. In both patients, the diagnosis was made based 
on the clinical presentation, EMG and CLCN1 gene sequencing. Patient 1 also had 
a muscle biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing in both patients reveals previously unidentified 
mutations in the CLCN1 gene specific to Myotonia Congenita. We report the 
salient clinical features of each patient and discuss the effects and common 
types of CLCN1 mutations and review the literature.
