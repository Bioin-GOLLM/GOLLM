DDX3 is an RNA chaperone of the DEAD-box family that regulates translation. 
Ded1, the yeast ortholog of DDX3, is a global regulator of translation, whereas 
DDX3 is thought to preferentially affect a subset of mRNAs. However, the set of 
mRNAs that are regulated by DDX3 are unknown, along with the relationship 
between DDX3 binding and activity. Here, we use ribosome profiling, RNA-seq, and 
PAR-CLIP to define the set of mRNAs that are regulated by DDX3 in human cells. 
We find that while DDX3 binds highly expressed mRNAs, depletion of DDX3 
particularly affects the translation of a small subset of the transcriptome. We 
further find that DDX3 binds a site on helix 16 of the human ribosomal rRNA, 
placing it immediately adjacent to the mRNA entry channel. Translation changes 
caused by depleting DDX3 levels or expressing an inactive point mutation are 
different, consistent with different association of these genetic variant types 
with disease. Taken together, this work defines the subset of the transcriptome 
that is responsive to DDX3 inhibition, with relevance for basic biology and 
disease states where DDX3 is altered.
