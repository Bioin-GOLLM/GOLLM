TERT promoter mutations (TERT-mut) have been detected in 60% to 80% of 
urothelial carcinomas. A molecular urine-based screening assay for the detection 
of TERT-mut is currently being pursued by our group and others. A small but 
significant number of bladder carcinomas are adenocarcinoma. The current study 
assesses the incidence of TERT-mut in primary adenocarcinomas of urinary 
bladder. A retrospective search of our institutional pathology records 
identified 23 cystectomy specimens with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma 
(2000-2014). All slides were reviewed by a senior urologic pathologist to 
confirm tumor type and select a representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
block for mutational analysis. Adequate material for DNA testing was available 
in 14 cases (7 enteric type and 7 not otherwise specified). TERT-mut sequencing 
analysis was performed using previously described SafeSeq technique. Overall, 
28.5% of primary adenocarcinoma harbored TERT-mut. Interestingly, 57% of 
nonenteric adenocarcinomas were mutation positive, whereas none of the 
enteric-type tumors harbored mutations. Similar to urothelial carcinoma, we 
found a relatively higher rate of TERT-mut among nonenteric-type adenocarcinomas 
further supporting the potential utility of TERT-mut urine-based screening assay 
for bladder cancer.
