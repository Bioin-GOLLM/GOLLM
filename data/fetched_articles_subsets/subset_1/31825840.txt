The translation initiation repressor 4E-BP2 is deamidated in the brain on 
asparagines N99/N102 during early postnatal brain development. This 
post-translational modification enhances 4E-BP2 association with Raptor, a 
central component of mTORC1 and alters the kinetics of excitatory synaptic 
transmission. We show that 4E-BP2 deamidation is neuron specific, occurs in the 
human brain, and changes 4E-BP2 subcellular localization, but not its disordered 
structure state. We demonstrate that deamidated 4E-BP2 is ubiquitinated more and 
degrades faster than the unmodified protein. We find that enhanced deamidated 
4E-BP2 degradation is dependent on Raptor binding, concomitant with increased 
association with a Raptor-CUL4B E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Deamidated 4E-BP2 
stability is promoted by inhibiting mTORC1 or glutamate receptors. We further 
demonstrate that deamidated 4E-BP2 regulates the translation of a distinct pool 
of mRNAs linked to cerebral development, mitochondria, and NF-κB activity, and 
thus may be crucial for postnatal brain development in neurodevelopmental 
disorders, such as ASD.
