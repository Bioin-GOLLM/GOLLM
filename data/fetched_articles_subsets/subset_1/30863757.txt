BACKGROUND: Adiponectin (ADIPOQ) is an important factor involved in the 
regulation of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Polymorphisms in the 
ADIPOQ gene are known to influence an individual's predisposition to metabolic 
syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, women with gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM) are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Several studies 
have been conducted previously to assess the association between ADIPOQ 
polymorphisms and GDM; however, the results of the association are inconclusive.
AIM: To quantitatively evaluate the association between ADIPOQ +45T/G, +276G/T, 
and -11377C/G polymorphisms and the risk of GDM.
METHODS: A systematic search of EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, and 
WANFANG DATA was conducted up to October 20, 2018. We calculated merged odds 
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effects or 
random-effects model depending on the between-study heterogeneity to evaluate 
the association between AIDPOQ +45T/G, +276G/T, and -11377C/G polymorphisms and 
the risk of GDM. Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity. Publication and 
sensitivity bias analyses were performed to test the robustness of the 
association. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata12.0.
RESULTS: Nine studies of +45T/G included 1024 GDM cases and 1059 controls, five 
studies of +276G/T included 590 GDM cases and 595 controls, and five studies of 
-11377C/G included 722 GDM cases and 791 controls. Pooled ORs indicated that 
+45T/G increased GDM risk in Asians (allelic model: OR = 1.47, 95%CI: 1.27-1.70, 
P = 0.000; dominant model: OR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.27-1.85, P = 0.000; recessive 
model: OR=2.00, 95%CI: 1.43-2.85, P = 0.000), not in South Americans (allelic 
model: OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.68-2.41, P = 0.510; dominant model: OR = 1.13, 95%CI: 
0.59-2.15, P = 0.710; recessive model: OR = 2.18, 95%CI: 0.43-11.07, P = 0.350). 
There were no significant associations between +276G/T (allelic model: OR = 
0.88, 95%CI: 0.74-1.05, P = 0.158; dominant model: OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.65-1.26, 
P = 0.561; recessive model: OR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.64-1.05, P = 0.118) or -11377C/G 
(allelic model: OR = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.72-1.26, P = 0.750; dominant model: OR = 
1.00, 95%CI: 0.73-1.37, P = 0.980; recessive model: OR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.61-1.32, 
P = 0.570) and the risk of GDM.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis shows the critical role of the ADIPOQ +45T/G 
polymorphism in GDM, especially in Asians. Studies focused on delineating 
ethnicity-specific factors with larger sample sizes are needed.
