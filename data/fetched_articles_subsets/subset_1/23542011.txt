APOBEC3B is one of seven human APOBEC3 DNA cytosine deaminases that function to 
inhibit the replication and persistence of retroelements and retroviruses. Human 
APOBEC3B restricts the replication of HIV-1 in HEK293 cells, while our 
laboratory clone of rhesus macaque APOBEC3B did not. We mapped the restriction 
determinant to a single amino acid difference that alters enzymatic activity. 
Human APOBEC3B D316 is catalytically active and capable of restricting HIV-1 
while rhesus APOBEC3B N316 is not; swapping these residues alters the activity 
and restriction phenotypes respectively. Genotyping of primate center rhesus 
macaques revealed uniform homozygosity for aspartate at position 316. 
Considering the C-to-T nature of the underlying mutation, we suspect that our 
rhesus APOBEC3B cDNA was inactivated by its own gene product during subcloning 
in Escherichia coli. This region has been previously characterized for its role 
in substrate specificity, but these data indicate it also has a fundamental role 
in deaminase activity.
