The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in China. Here, we aimed 
to evaluate the latest demographic trends and KRAS/BRAF mutations status of 
Chinese CRC. Five thousand five hundred and forty-six CRC patients diagnosed 
from 2010 to 2017 were involved. KRAS exon 2 and BRAFV600E mutations were 
detected by Sanger sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis or 
allelic-specific probe method. Gene mutation profiles and clinicopathologic 
characteristics of 5495 patients were analyzed. The joinpoint regression model 
was used to predict the demographic data in 2018. We found KRAS exon 2 and 
BRAFV600E mutation rates were 37.7 and 2.8% in CRC patients. Tumors with KRAS 
exon 2 mutations were more likely to be present in female and patients aged 
older than 75 years, right colon and have well-differentiated histology. Tumors 
with BRAFV600E mutations were more likely to be present in the female, right 
colon and have poorly differentiated histology. From 2010 to 2017, the 
percentage of colon cancer and tubular adenocarcinoma in CRC increased 
substantially (from 39.3 to 51.8%, from 78.6 to 93.4%, respectively). The 
percentage of right colon cancer increased from 18.3 to 20.5%, which 
predictively may keep at 22.6% in 2018. The rise trends for patients with 
moderate differentiation tumor or KRAS exon 2 mutated tumor were apparent (from 
50.3 to 78.6%, from 32.8 to 39.7%, respectively). In conclusion, in recent 8 
years, there is a shift to the colon, especially right colon in the incidence of 
Chinese CRC. Moreover tubular adenocarcinoma is becoming the primary histology 
type.
