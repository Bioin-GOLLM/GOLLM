OBJECTIVE: Frequent studies have confirmed that homozygous or compound 
heterozygous loss-of-function mutation p.Thr60Met in NaCl cotransporter (NCC) 
lead to the salt-wasting Gitelman's syndrome (GS) of hypotension. The finding 
that Thr60 is a key SPAK/OSR1 phosphorylation site on NCC also raises the 
possible importance of Thr60 in regulating the activity of NCC and blood 
pressure (BP). However, the association of heterozygous NCC mutation p.Thr60Met 
and BP has not yet been studied.
METHODS: We collected 38 heterozygous mutation p.Thr60Met carriers, 
respectively, from 14 GS families confirmed by our previous studies and 1,000 
unrelated Han Chinese, and matched them pairwise (sex, age ±2 years and BMI ±1) 
with 38 unrelated healthy controls. BP and biochemistry data were obtained. 
Student's t test and χ(2) test were used to compare the differences between 
these study subjects with the heterozygous variant p.T60M and the controls. p < 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: p.Thr60Met carriers had markedly lower BP (systolic 110.3 ± 13.5 vs. 
119.1 ± 15.0 mm Hg; diastolic 70.2 ± 7.0 vs. 75.4 ± 8.2 mm Hg, p < 0.01) than 
controls. p.Thr60Met heterozygotes had higher fasting plasma glucose 
concentration (5.35 ± 0.73 vs. 4.95 ± 0.69 mmol/l, p < 0.01). 14 carriers versus 
6 control subjects had impaired fasting glucose (36.8 vs. 15.8%, p < 0.01), and 
p.Thr60Met carriers had higher 24-hour urinary sodium excretion than controls 
but not significantly (170.2 ± 35.6 vs. 159.5 ± 39.0 mmol, p = 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: The NCC mutation p.Thr60Met carriers in Han populations have 
markedly lower BP and slightly higher fasting plasma glucose compared with 
normal controls.
