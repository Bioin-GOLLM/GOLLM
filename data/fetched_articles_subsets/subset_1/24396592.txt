Background. Universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ARVT) started in Mexico 
in 2001; no evaluation of the features of ARVT prescriptions over time has been 
conducted. The aim of the study is to document trends in the quality of 
ARVT-prescription before and after universal access. Methods. We describe ARVT 
prescriptions before and after 2001 in three health facilities from the 
following subsystems: the Mexican Social Security (IMSS), the Ministry of Health 
(SSA), and National Institutes of Health (INS). Combinations of drugs and 
reasons for change were classified according to current Mexican guidelines and 
state-of-the-art therapy. Comparisons were made using χ (2) tests. Results. 
Before 2001, 29% of patients starting ARVT received HAART; after 2001 it 
increased to 90%. The proportion of adequate prescriptions decreased within the 
two periods of study in all facilities (P value < 0.01). The INS and SSA were 
more likely to be prescribed adequately (P value < 0.01) compared to IMSS. The 
distribution of reasons for change was not significantly different during this 
time for all facilities (P value > 0.05). Conclusions. Universal ARVT access in 
Mexico was associated with changes in ARVT-prescription patterns over time. 
Health providers' performance improved, but not homogeneously. Training of 
personnel and guidelines updating is essential to improve prescription.
