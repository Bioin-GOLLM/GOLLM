The accumulation of tau protein aggregates is a pathological hallmark in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the 
identity of the toxic tau conformation that propagates and induces 
neurodegeneration is still unknown. Anti-tau antibodies are a common tool used 
to differentiate between normal and pathological-associated tau forms or as 
passive immunotherapy in the quest to interfere with tau-mediated 
neurodegeneration. Here, we show that Tau13, a tau N-terminal antibody, 
preferentially enriches high molecular weight tau species produced in a 
tauopathy mouse model and AD. The data suggest that Tau13 has higher affinity to 
specific tau conformation presence in higher molecular weight tau species.
