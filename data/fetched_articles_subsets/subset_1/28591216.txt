The contribution of diabetes to breast cancer remains uncertain among Chinese 
females, which may result from different genetic factors. We evaluated the 
associations of diabetes, combined with the polymorphisms in the genes of fat 
mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and heat shock 
protein 60 (HSPD1), with breast cancer risk and survival in a Chinese Han 
population. The information on the history of diabetes was collected from 1551 
incident breast cancer cases and 1605 age-frequency matched controls in 
Guangzhou, China. In total, 1168 cases were followed up. Diabetes was associated 
with both an increased risk of breast cancer [OR (95%CI): 1.67 (1.11, 2.52)] and 
a poor overall survival and progression free survival for breast cancer patients 
[HRs (95%CIs): 2.66 (1.10, 6.44) and 2.46 (1.29, 4.70), respectively]. IL-6 
rs1800796 and HSPD1 rs2605039 had interactions with diabetes on breast cancer 
risk. Among women with CC genotype of IL-6 rs1800796 or GG genotype of HSPD1 
rs2605039, diabetic individuals had a remarkably increased risk of breast cancer 
compared to non-diabetic women with ORs and 95%CIs of 2.53 (1.45, 4.41) and 6.40 
(2.29, 17.87), respectively. GT/TT genotypes of HSPD1 rs2605039 was also 
associated with a better progression free survival for breast cancer patients 
[HR (95%CI): 0.70 (0.49, 0.99)]. Our results suggest that the contribution of 
diabetes to breast cancer risk might be modified by IL-6 rs1800796 and HSPD1 
rs2605039. Diabetes and HSPD1 rs2605039 might also influence breast cancer 
prognosis.
