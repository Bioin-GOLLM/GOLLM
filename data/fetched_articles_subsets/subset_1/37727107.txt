ABSTRACTThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a severe threat to human 
health; therefore, simple, high-throughput neutralization assays are desirable 
for developing vaccines and drugs against COVID-19. In this study, a high-titre 
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was successfully packaged by truncating the C-terminus of 
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by 21 amino acids and infecting 293â€…T cells that 
had been stably transfected with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptor and furin (named AF cells), to establish a simple, high-throughput, and 
automated 384-well plate neutralization assay. The method was optimized for cell 
amount, virus inoculation, incubation time, and detection time. The automated 
assay showed good sensitivity, accuracy, reproducibility, Z' factor, and a good 
correlation with the live virus neutralization assay. The high-throughput 
approach would make it available for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test in 
large-scale clinical trials and seroepidemiological surveys which would aid the 
accelerated vaccine development and evaluation.
