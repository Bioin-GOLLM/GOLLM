Genes for chlorite dismutase-like proteins are found widely among 
heme-synthesizing bacteria and some Archaea. It is now known that among the 
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria these proteins do not possess chlorite dismutase 
activity but instead are essential for heme synthesis. These proteins, named 
HemQ, are iron-coproporphyrin (coproheme) decarboxylases that catalyze the 
oxidative decarboxylation of coproheme III into protoheme IX. As purified, HemQs 
do not contain bound heme, but readily bind exogeneously supplied heme with low 
micromolar affinity. The heme-bound form of HemQ has low peroxidase activity and 
in the presence of peroxide the bound heme may be destroyed. Thus, it is 
possible that HemQ may serve a dual role as a decarboxylase in heme biosynthesis 
and a regulatory protein in heme homeostasis.
