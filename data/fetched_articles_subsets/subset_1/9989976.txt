Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) provokes a vigorous, generalized 
proinflammatory state in the infected host. Genetic regulation of this response 
has been localized to the Lps locus on mouse chromosome 4, through study of the 
C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr inbred strains. Both C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice are 
homozygous for a mutant Lps allele (Lpsd/d) that confers hyporesponsiveness to 
LPS challenge, and therefore exhibit natural tolerance to its lethal effects. 
Genetic and physical mapping of 1,345 backcross progeny segregating this mutant 
phenotype confined Lps to a 0.9-cM interval spanning 1.7 Mb. Three transcription 
units were identified within the candidate interval, including Toll-like 
receptor 4 (Tlr4), part of a protein family with members that have been 
implicated in LPS-induced cell signaling. C3H/HeJ mice have a point mutation 
within the coding region of the Tlr4 gene, resulting in a nonconservative 
substitution of a highly conserved proline by histidine at codon 712, whereas 
C57BL/ 10ScCr mice exhibit a deletion of Tlr4. Identification of distinct 
mutations involving the same gene at the Lps locus in two different 
hyporesponsive inbred mouse strains strongly supports the hypothesis that 
altered Tlr4 function is responsible for endotoxin tolerance.
