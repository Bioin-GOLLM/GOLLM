Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the regulatory elements of a gene 
can alter gene expression, making these SNPs of prime importance for candidate 
gene association studies. We aimed to determine whether such regulatory variants 
are associated with clinical outcomes in three cohorts of patients with prostate 
cancer. We used RegulomeDB to identify potential regulatory variants based on in 
silico predictions and reviewed genome-wide experimental findings. Overall, 131 
putative regulatory SNPs with the highest confidence score on predicted 
functionality were investigated in two independent localized prostate cancer 
cohorts totalling 458 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. The 
statistically significant SNPs identified in these two cohorts were then tested 
in an additional cohort of 504 patients with advanced prostate cancer. We 
identified one regulatory SNPs, rs1646724, that are consistently associated with 
increased risk of recurrence in localized disease (P = .003) and mortality in 
patients with advanced prostate cancer (P = .032) after adjusting for known 
clinicopathological factors. Further investigation revealed that rs1646724 may 
affect expression of SLC35B4, which encodes a glycosyltransferase, and that 
down-regulation of SLC35B4 by transfecting short hairpin RNA in DU145 human 
prostate cancer cell suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion. 
Furthermore, we found increased SLC35B4 expression correlated with more 
aggressive forms of prostate cancer and poor patient prognosis. Our study 
provides robust evidence that regulatory genetic variants can affect clinical 
outcomes.
