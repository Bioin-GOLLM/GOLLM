Proteolytic cleavage is an important post-translational mechanism to increase 
protein variability and functionality. In cancer, this process can be 
deregulated to shut off tumor-suppressive functions. Here, we report that in 
glioblastoma (GBM), the tumor suppressor ZBTB18 is targeted for protein cleavage 
by the intracellular protease calpain. The N-terminal (Nte) ZBTB18 cleaved 
fragment localizes to the cytoplasm and thus, is unable to exert the gene 
expression repressive function of the uncleaved protein. Mass spectrometry (MS) 
analysis indicates that the Nte ZBTB18 short form (SF) interacts with C-terminal 
(Cte) binding proteins 1 and 2 (CTBP1/2), which appear to be involved in HIF1A 
signaling activation. In fact, we show that the new ZBTB18 product activates 
HIF1A-regulated genes, which in turn lead to increased lipid uptake, lipid 
droplets (LD) accumulation, and enhanced metabolic activity. We propose that 
calpain-mediated ZBTB18 cleavage represents a new mechanism to counteract ZBTB18 
tumor suppression and increase tumor-promoting functions in GBM cells.
