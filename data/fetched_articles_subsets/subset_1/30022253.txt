We investigated the association of clinical variables with TBS at baseline in 
the bone health sub-cohort of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL). Lower TBS 
was associated with female sex, aging, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, SSRI use, high alcohol 
intake, and presence of diabetes; there was a trend towards significance between 
lower TBS and history of fragility fractures.
INTRODUCTION: We investigated whether TBS differs by sex, race, body mass index 
(BMI), and other clinical variables.
METHODS: The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) is determining effects of 
vitamin D3 and/or omega-3 fatty acid (FA) supplements in reducing risks of 
cancer and cardiovascular disease. In the VITAL: Effects on Bone 
Structure/Architecture ancillary study, effects of these interventions on bone 
will be investigated. Here, we examine the associations of clinical risk factors 
with TBS assessments at baseline in the bone health sub-cohort, comprised of 672 
participants (369 men and 303 women), mean (± SD) age 63.5 ± 6.0 years; 
BMI ≤ 37 kg/m2, no bisphosphonates within 2 years or other bone active 
medications within 1 year.
RESULTS: TBS was greater in men than women (1.311 vs. 1.278, P < 0.001) and 
lower with elevated BMIs (P < 0.001), higher age (P = 0.004), diabetes 
(P = 0.008), SSRI use (P = 0.044), and high alcohol intake (P = 0.009). There 
was a trend for history of fragility fractures (P = 0.072), and lower TBS. TBS 
did not vary when analyzed by race, smoking, history of falls, and multivitamin 
or caffeine use.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower TBS was associated with female sex, aging, BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, 
SSRI use, alcohol use, and presence of diabetes; there was a trend between lower 
TBS and history of fragility fractures. TBS may be useful clinically to assess 
structural changes that may be associated with fractures among patients who are 
overweight or obese, those on SSRIs, or with diabetes. Ongoing follow-up studies 
will clarify the effects of supplemental vitamin D3 and/or FA's on TBS and other 
bone health measures.
