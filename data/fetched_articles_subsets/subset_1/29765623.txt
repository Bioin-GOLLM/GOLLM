Computational inside of Banert cascade reaction for triazole formation is 
studied with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The reaction proceeds mainly by 
SN2 initial chloride displacement rather than SN2'-type attack. Furthermore, 
according to the rate of reaction calculation, SN2 displacement is much faster 
than SN2' displacement in the order of 8. The [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement 
for the conversion of propargyl azide into triazafulvene has been proved as the 
rate-determining step having highest activation energy parameter. Solvent effect 
on total course of reaction has been found negligible. Furthermore, effects of 
different density functional theory functionals and functional groups on 
activation energies of [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of propargyl azide were 
also studied. BHHLYP, ωB97XD, M062X and BMK calculated ΔG‡ are consistent with 
B3LYP.
