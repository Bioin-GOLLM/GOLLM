A case of visual hallucination, headache and left hemiparesis is reported. The 
patient had a history of recurrent attacks of similar semiology for the previous 
15 years. MRI brain revealed a cortical hyperintensity on T2W, FLAIR and 
diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in the right cerebral hemisphere with a normal 
ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) map and MR angiogram. Detailed workup for 
MELAS was negative. A diagnosis of sporadic hemiplegic migraine was made and he 
was managed conservatively. He made a gradual complete recovery over 2 weeks. He 
was discharged on flunarizine for prophylaxis and has remained asymptomatic over 
the ensuing 4 months. This interesting condition is reviewed and discussed 
herein.
