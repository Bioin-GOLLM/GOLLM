Detection of foreign materials is the first step of successful immune responses. 
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) was shown to directly bind cyclic 
diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP), a bacterial second messenger, and to 
elicit strong interferon responses. Here we elucidate the structural features of 
the cytosolic c-di-GMP binding domain (CBD) of STING and its complex with 
c-di-GMP. The CBD exhibits an α + β fold and is a dimer in the crystal and in 
solution. Surprisingly, one c-di-GMP molecule binds to the central crevice of a 
STING dimer, using a series of stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions. We 
show that STING is autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the 
CBD and the C-terminal tail (CTT) and that c-di-GMP releases STING from this 
autoinhibition by displacing the CTT. The structures provide a remarkable 
example of pathogen-host interactions in which a unique microbial molecule 
directly engages the innate immune system.
