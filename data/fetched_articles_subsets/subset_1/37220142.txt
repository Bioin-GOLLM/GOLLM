BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and MFN2 are outer mitochondrial 
membrane fusogenic proteins regulating mitochondrial network morphology. MFN2 
mutations cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A), an axonal neuropathy 
characterized by mitochondrial fusion defects, which in the case of a GTPase 
domain mutant, were rescued following wild-type MFN1/2 (MFN1/2WT ) 
overexpression. In this study, we compared the therapeutic efficiency between 
MFN1WT and MFN2WT overexpression in correcting mitochondrial defects induced by 
the novel MFN2K357T mutation located in the highly conserved R3 region.
METHODS: Constructs expressing either MFN2K357T , MFN2WT , or MFN1WT under the 
ubiquitous chicken β-actin hybrid (CBh) promoter were generated. Flag or myc tag 
was used for their detection. Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were single 
transfected with MFN1WT , MFN2WT , or MFN2K357T , as well as double transfected 
with MFN2K357T /MFN2WT or MFN2K357T /MFN1WT .
RESULTS: SH-SY5Y cells transfected with MFN2K357T exhibited severe perinuclear 
mitochondrial clustering with axon-like processes devoid of mitochondria. Single 
transfection with MFN1WT resulted in a more interconnected mitochondrial network 
than transfection with MFN2WT , accompanied by mitochondrial clusters. Double 
transfection of MFN2K357T with either MFN1WT or MFN2WT resolved the 
mutant-induced mitochondrial clusters and led to detectable mitochondria 
throughout the axon-like processes. MFN1WT showed higher efficacy than MFN2WT in 
rescuing these defects.
INTERPRETATION: These results further demonstrate the higher potential of MFN1WT 
over MFN2WT overexpression to rescue CMT2A-induced mitochondrial network 
abnormalities due to mutations outside the GTPase domain. This higher phenotypic 
rescue conferred by MFN1WT , possibly due to its higher mitochondrial fusogenic 
ability, may be applied to different CMT2A cases regardless of the MFN2 mutation 
type.
