BACKGROUND: Intra-operative cell salvage (CS) was reported to have no impairment 
on blood coagulation in low-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary 
bypass (CPB), but studies in high-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery are limited. The 
objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of CS on blood coagulation in 
high-bleeding-risk cardiac surgery with CPB.
METHODS: One hundred and ten patients were randomly assigned to either with 
intra-operative CS group (Group CS) or without intra-operative CS group (Group 
C). Study endpoints included the incidence of impairment of blood coagulation 
during perioperative period (peri-op) and the incidence of adverse events during 
postoperative period (post-op). Peri-op was defined as the period from beginning 
of anesthesia (anesthesia induction) to 24 h after end of surgery. Post-op was 
defined as the period from the end of surgery to 24 h after end of surgery. The 
types of impairment of blood coagulation included heparin residual, coagulopathy 
due to low PLT, coagulopathy due to low FIB, coagulopathy due to low coagulation 
factors, hyperfibrinolytic. The sum of above five types was total impairment of 
blood coagulation. Adverse events included excessive bleeding, resternotomy, 
etc.
RESULTS: The incidence of heparin residual measured both at the end of surgery 
and during post-op were significantly higher in Group CS than in Group C (15.09 
vs 4.00, 13.21 vs 2.00 %; p = 0.024, 0.010, respectively). Similarly, the 
incidence of total impairment of blood coagulation at the end of surgery and 
during post-op were significantly higher in Group CS than in Group C (32.08 vs 
18.00, 26.42 vs 12.00 %; p = 0.043, 0.040, respectively). The incidence of 
excessive bleeding during post-op was 32.08 % in Group CS compared with 16.00 % 
in Group C (p = 0.038). Intriguingly, CS was associated with a significantly 
increase in the relative risk ratios for heparin residual and excessive bleeding 
(p = 0.034, 0.049, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-operative CS could impair blood coagulation in the scenario 
of high-risk-bleeding cardiac surgery with CPB.
