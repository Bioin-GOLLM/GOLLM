Electrochemical energy storage systems have a wide range of commercial 
applications. They keep energy and power even at temperatures up to +60 °C. 
However, the capacity and power of such energy storage systems reduce sharply at 
negative temperatures due to the difficulty of counterion injection into the 
electrode material. The application of organic electrode materials based on 
salen-type polymers is a prospective approach to the development of materials 
for low-temperature energy sources. Poly[Ni(CH3Salen)]-based electrode materials 
synthesized from different electrolytes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and quartz crystal microgravimetry at 
temperatures from -40 °C to 20 °C. By analyzing data obtained in various 
electrolyte solutions, it was shown that at subzero temperatures, the process of 
injection into the polymer film, together with slow diffusion within the film, 
predominantly limit the electrochemical performance of electrode materials based 
on poly[Ni(CH3Salen)]. It was shown that the deposition of the polymer from 
solutions with larger cations allow the enhancement of the charge transfer due 
to the formation of porous structures facilitating the counter-ion diffusion.
