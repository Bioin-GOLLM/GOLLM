C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune 
cell activation and migration as well as the progression of many cancers. We 
performed an in silico analysis using public data resources and found that the 
lung cancer patients with higher CCR5 expression had a notably better overall 
survival than those with lower CCR5 expression patients and CCR5 expression 
level is positive correlated with the infiltration of immune cells, such as B, 
CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells, in both lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell 
cancer. In the present study, we investigated the association between the 
promoter polymorphism of CCR5 and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A 
case-control study of 449 NSCLC patients and 516 controls of Chinese Han 
population was conducted, along with polymorphism detection using a sequencing 
method. A dual-luciferase reporter assay system was used to analyse the 
transcriptional activity of CCR5 promoter variations. Our results showed that 
the frequency of rs1799987-AA was significantly higher in the NSCLC group than 
in the controls in recessive model (p = .007, OR = 1.66 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.14-2.40, adjusted by sex and age); the G allele showed a significant 
associated with NSCLC in dominant model (p = .003, OR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.18-2.28, 
adjusted by sex and age). Compared with haplotype H1 
rs2227010-rs2734648-rs1799987-rs1799988-rs1800023-rs1800024: A-T-G-T-G-C, 
haplotype H5: A-G-G-T-G-C increased the risk of NSCLC by over 10-fold 
(p < .0001, OR = 16.09, 95%CI: 5.37-48.20, adjusted by sex and age) and notably 
depressed the transcriptional activity of the CCR5 promoter in 293T, A549, H1299 
and HeLa cells. In conclusion, CCR5 promoter polymorphisms are significantly 
associated with NSCLC by affecting the transcriptional activity of the CCR5 
promoter.
