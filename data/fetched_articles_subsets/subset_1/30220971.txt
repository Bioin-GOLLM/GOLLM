Radiotherapy is an essential component of cancer therapy. Despite advances in 
cancer genomics, the mutation signatures of radioresistant tumors have not yet 
been fully elucidated. To address this issue, we analyzed a unique set of 
clinical specimens from a uterine cervical cancer that repeatedly locally 
recurred after multiple rounds of radiotherapy. Exon sequencing of 409 
cancer-related genes in the treatment-na√Øve tumor and the tumors that recurred 
after initial and secondary radiotherapy identified (i) activating mutations in 
PIK3CA and KRAS, and putative inactivating mutations in SMAD4, as trunk mutation 
signatures that persisted over the clinical course; and (ii) mutations in KMT2A, 
TET1, and NLRP1 as acquired mutation signatures observed only in recurrent 
tumors after radiotherapy. Comprehensive mining of published in vitro genomics 
data pertaining to radiosensitivity revealed that simultaneous mutations in KRAS 
and SMAD4, which have not been described previously in uterine cervical cancer, 
are associated with cancer cell radioresistance. The association between this 
mutation signature and radioresistance was validated by isogenic cell-based 
experiments. These results provide proof-of-principle for the analytical 
pipeline employed in this study, which explores clinically relevant mutation 
signatures for radioresistance, and demonstrate that this approach is worth 
pursuing with larger cohorts in the future.
