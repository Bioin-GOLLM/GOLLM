BACKGROUND: Nivolumab is an anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor active in patients 
with advanced melanoma and as adjuvant therapy in high-risk metastatic melanoma 
patients.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective analysis, we investigated the CD73 
enzyme activity in patients with metastatic melanoma stage IV and its 
correlation with the response to nivolumab. The soluble CD73 (sCD73) enzyme 
activity was measured in the serum of 37 melanoma patients before receiving 
nivolumab and the Harrel's C index was used to find the best cut-off for this 
biomarker. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate 
the prognostic value of CD73 enzyme activity for survival and progression-free 
survival.
RESULTS: Our results show that high levels of sCD73 enzyme activity were 
significantly associated with poor overall survival and progression-free 
survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. The median progression-free 
survival was 2.6 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9-3.3] in patients with 
high sCD73 enzyme activity (> 27.8 pmol/min/mg protein), and 14.2 months (95% CI 
4.6-23.8) in patients with lower CD73 enzyme activity, when patients were 
follow-up for a median of 24 months range. The median overall survival was not 
reached in patients with low sCD73 activity (< 27.8 pmol/min/mg protein) 
compared with 6.1 months (95% CI 0-14.8) in patients with higher sCD73 activity. 
In multivariate analyses, the sCD73 enzyme activity emerged as the strongest 
prognostic factor for overall survival and progression-free survival. Elevated 
basal levels of sCD73 enzyme activity, before starting nivolumab treatment, were 
associated with lower response rates to therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a significant association between the activity of sCD73 
in the blood and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma stage 
IV, receiving nivolumab. Although our results need to be confirmed and 
validated, we suggest that sCD73 might be used as serologic prognostic 
biomarker. Potentially evaluating sCD73 enzyme activity in the peripheral blood 
before treatment could help to estimate the response to nivolumab.
