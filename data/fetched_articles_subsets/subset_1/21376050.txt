BACKGROUND & AIMS: High-level coffee consumption has been associated with 
reduced progression of pre-existing liver diseases and lower risk of 
hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its relationship with therapy for hepatitis C 
virus infection has not been evaluated.
METHODS: Patients (n=885) from the lead-in phase of the Hepatitis C Antiviral 
Long-Term Treatment Against Cirrhosis Trial recorded coffee intake before 
retreatment with peginterferon α-2a (180 μg/wk) and ribavirin (1000-1200 
mg/day). We assessed patients for early virologic response (2 log10 reduction in 
level of hepatitis C virus RNA at week 12; n=466), and undetectable hepatitis C 
virus RNA at weeks 20 (n=320), 48 (end of treatment, n=284), and 72 (sustained 
virologic response; n=157).
RESULTS: Median log10 drop from baseline to week 20 was 2.0 (interquartile range 
[IQR], 0.6-3.9) among nondrinkers and 4.0 (IQR, 2.1-4.7) among patients that 
drank 3 or more cups/day of coffee (P trend<.0001). After adjustment for age, 
race/ethnicity, sex, alcohol, cirrhosis, ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to 
alanine aminotransferase, the IL28B polymorphism rs12979860, dose reduction of 
peginterferon, and other covariates, odds ratios for drinking 3 or more cups/day 
vs nondrinking were 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-3.6; P trend=.004) 
for early virologic response, 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-3.9; P trend=.005) for week 20 
virologic response, 2.4 (95% CI: 1.3-4.6; P trend=.001) for end of treatment, 
and 1.8 (95% CI: 0.8-3.9; P trend=.034) for sustained virologic response.
CONCLUSIONS: High-level consumption of coffee (more than 3 cups per day) is an 
independent predictor of improved virologic response to peginterferon plus 
ribavirin in patients with hepatitis C.
