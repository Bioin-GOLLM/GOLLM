PURPOSE: Nevirapine (NVP) is an anti-retroviral drug used for the treatment of 
HIV infection, that may cause several severe adverse events, including Stevens 
Johnsons Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN). A recent whole genome 
association study highlighted a strong association with allopurinol-induced 
SJS/TEN within the HCP5 and PSORS1C1 genes in the Japanese population. Our aim 
was to verify the contribution of these two genes in the susceptibility to 
NVP-induced SJS/TEN in a population from Mozambique.
METHODS: Genotyping of PSORS1C1 rs2233945 and HCP5 rs3099844 SNPs was performed 
in a sample of 27 patients with SJS/TEN and 76 controls. A case-control and a 
haplotype analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The HCP5 rs3099844 variant allele was significantly associated with the 
SJS/TEN susceptibility (OR = 2.03 and P = 0.039). The TA haplotype, carrying 
both the variant alleles of the two genes, showed a higher risk for developing 
SJS/TEN (OR = 3.44and P = 0.003). The regression analysis confirmed the 
contribution of HCP5 rs3099844 SNP (OR = 2.05, P = 0.047). By a log-linear 
model, we also investigated for interaction between HCP5 rs309844 and PSORS1C1 
rs2233945 SNPs with respect to SJS/TEN risk, and we observed a strong 
interaction between the two SNPs (P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association of HCP5 with the SJS/TEN 
susceptibility in a population from Mozambique treated with NVP.
