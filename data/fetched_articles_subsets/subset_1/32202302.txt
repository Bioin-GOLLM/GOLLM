Antibiotic- and heat-resistant bacteria in camel milk is a potential public 
health problem. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is an opportunistic pathogen 
in humans, dairy cattle and camels. We characterized the phenotype and genotype 
of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal strains recovered from pasteurized and 
raw camel milk (as control) distributed in the retail markets of Saudi Arabia. 
Of the 100 samples assessed between March and May 2016, 20 S. aureus isolates 
were recovered from pasteurized milk, 10 of which were resistant to cefoxitin, 
and as such, were methicillin-resistant. However, raw camel milk did not contain 
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests 
showed that the resistance ratio for other antibiotics was 60%. We performed a 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers for the 
methicillin-resistant gene mecA and nucleotide sequencing to detect and verify 
the methicillin-resistant strains. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) 
analysis of the gene sequences showed a 96-100% similarity between the resistant 
isolates and the S. aureus CS100 strain's mecA gene. Ten of the 
methicillin-resistant isolates were heat-resistant and were stable at 
temperatures up to 85°C for 60 s, and three of these were resistant at 90°C for 
60 or 90 s. The mean decimal reduction time (D85-value) was 111 s for the ten 
isolates. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) 
showed that there was no difference in the total protein profiles for the ten 
methicillin heat-resistant S. aureus (MHRSA) isolates and for S. aureus ATCC 
29737. In conclusion, a relatively high percentage of the tested pasteurized 
camel milk samples contained S. aureus (20%) and MHRSA (10%).
