In adult skin, hair follicles cyclically self-renew in a manner that 
recapitulates embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis. The most common pathology 
of hair in adults is alopecia, which is hair loss to different extent. There are 
a number of murine models of alopecia including spontaneous mutations. In the 
present study, we worked with double homozygous we/we wal/wal mice which 
demonstrate symptoms closely resembling human alopecia. Using whole-mount 
preparations of epidermis of E18.5 embryos we show that hair follicle defects 
can be revealed as early as during embryonic morphogenesis in these mutants. The 
number of hair follicles was reduced almost 1.5-fold in mutant skin. The shape 
of the early stage small follicles was altered in mutant animals as compared to 
control ones. Additionally, follicles of mutant embryos were wider at the point 
of conjunction with interfollicular epidermis. We believe that the mutant mice 
studied represent a fascinating model to address the problem of hair loss. We 
demonstrated alterations in the morphogenesis of embryonic hair follicle in 
we/we wal/wal double homozygous mice developing alopecia postnatally. We suppose 
that incorrect morphogenesis of hair follicles during embryogenesis is closely 
related to alopecia in the adult life. Unveiling the mechanisms involved in 
altered embryogenesis may elucidate the pathogenesis of alopecia.
