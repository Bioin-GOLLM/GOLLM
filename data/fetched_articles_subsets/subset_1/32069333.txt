The Gram-negative Epsilonproteobacterium Campylobacter jejuni is currently the 
most prevalent bacterial foodborne pathogen. Like for many other human 
pathogens, infection studies with C. jejuni mainly employ artificial animal or 
cell culture models that can be limited in their ability to reflect the in-vivo 
environment within the human host. Here, we report the development and 
application of a human three-dimensional (3D) infection model based on tissue 
engineering to study host-pathogen interactions. Our intestinal 3D tissue model 
is built on a decellularized extracellular matrix scaffold, which is reseeded 
with human Caco-2 cells. Dynamic culture conditions enable the formation of a 
polarized mucosal epithelial barrier reminiscent of the 3D microarchitecture of 
the human small intestine. Infection with C. jejuni demonstrates that the 3D 
tissue model can reveal isolate-dependent colonization and barrier disruption 
phenotypes accompanied by perturbed localization of cell-cell junctions. 
Pathogenesis-related phenotypes of C. jejuni mutant strains in the 3D model 
deviated from those obtained with 2D-monolayers, but recapitulated phenotypes 
previously observed in animal models. Moreover, we demonstrate the involvement 
of a small regulatory RNA pair, CJnc180/190, during infections and observe 
different phenotypes of CJnc180/190 mutant strains in 2D vs. 3D infection 
models. Hereby, the CJnc190 sRNA exerts its pathogenic influence, at least in 
part, via repression of PtmG, which is involved in flagellin modification. Our 
results suggest that the Caco-2 cell-based 3D tissue model is a valuable and 
biologically relevant tool between in-vitro and in-vivo infection models to 
study virulence of C. jejuni and other gastrointestinal pathogens.
