The way organelles are viewed by cell biologists is quickly changing. For many 
years, these cellular entities were thought to be unique and singular structures 
that performed specific roles. However, in recent decades, researchers have 
discovered that organelles are dynamic and form physical contacts. In addition, 
organelle interactions modulate several vital biological functions, and the 
dysregulation of these contacts is involved in cell dysfunction and different 
pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria-ER contact sites 
(MERCS) are among the most extensively studied and understood juxtapositioned 
interorganelle structures. In this review, we summarise the major biological and 
ultrastructural dysfunctions of MERCS in neurodegeneration, with a particular 
focus on Alzheimer's disease as well as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. We also propose an updated version of the 
MERCS hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease based on new findings. Finally, we 
discuss the possibility of MERCS being used as possible drug targets to halt 
cell death and neurodegeneration.
