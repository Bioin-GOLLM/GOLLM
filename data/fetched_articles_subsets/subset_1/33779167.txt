Viperin is a broadly conserved radical SAM enzyme that synthesizes the antiviral 
nucleotide ddhCTP. In higher animals, viperin expression also accelerates the 
degradation of various cellular and viral proteins necessary for viral 
replication; however, the details of this process remain largely unknown. Here, 
we show that viperin activates a component of the protein ubiquitination 
machinery, which plays an important role in both protein degradation and immune 
signaling pathways. We demonstrate that viperin binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
TRAF6, which catalyzes K63-linked ubiquitination associated with immune 
signaling pathways. Viperin activates ubiquitin transfer by TRAF6-2.5-fold and 
causes a significant increase in polyubiquitinated forms of TRAF6 that are 
important for mediating signal transduction. Our observations both imply a role 
for viperin as an agonist of immune signaling and suggest that viperin may 
activate other K48-linked E3-ligases involved in targeting proteins for 
proteasomal degradation.
