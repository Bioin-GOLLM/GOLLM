Investigation of Alternaria sp. AST0039, an endophytic fungus obtained from the 
leaf tissue of Astragalus lentiginosus, led to the isolation of 
(-)-(10E,15S)-4,6-dichloro-10(11)-dehydrocurvularin (1), 
(-)-(10E,15S)-6-chloro-10(11)-dehydrocurvularin (2), 
(-)-(10E,15S)-10(11)-dehydrocurvularin (3), and alterperylenepoxide A (4) 
together with scytalone and Î±-acetylorcinol. Structures of 1 and 4 were 
established from their spectroscopic data, and the relative configuration of 4 
was determined with the help of nuclear Overhauser effect difference data. All 
metabolites were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity and ability to induce 
heat-shock and unfolded protein responses. Compounds 2 and 3 exhibited 
cytotoxicity to all five cancer cell lines tested and increased the level of the 
pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP, but only 3 induced the heat-shock 
response and caused a strong unfolded protein response.
