INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to analyse the frequency of silent 
inactivation and allergic reaction to asparaginase (ASP) and its impact on 
treatment results in patients with lymphoblastic leukaemia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
treated with ASP were enrolled in the study. Asparaginase activity was 
monitored. The patients were switched to another ASP formulation after allergy 
or inactivation. The treatment results were analysed.
RESULTS: Silent inactivation of native E. coli ASP was diagnosed in 5 patients 
(7%) and allergy in 34 patients (49%), and these patients were switched to 
pegylated ASP (PEG-ASP). Silent inactivation of PEG-ASP occurred in 8 patients 
(23%) and allergy in 6 patients (17%). Eight children continued therapy with 
Erwinase, and 4 did not switch to Erwinase after inactivation of PEG-ASP. 
Allergy to Erwinase occurred in 2 patients (22%); there was no inactivation. No 
significant differences in outcome were found between the groups of patients 
with and without allergy or silent inactivation of ASP. Due to regular 
monitoring and switching to other ASP preparations after allergy or silent 
inactivation, therapeutic activity was ensured in almost all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of ASP activity is crucial to recognize silent 
inactivation and to guarantee treatment effectiveness by switching to other ASP 
preparations.
