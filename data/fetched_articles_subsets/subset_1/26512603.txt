The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 2 polymorphisms 
(ie, rs10877887 and rs13293512) in the promoter regions of let-7 and the risk of 
papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).A case-control study of 618 PTC patients and 
562 controls was conducted. The rs10877887 polymorphism was genotyped by using 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and the 
rs13293512 polymorphism was genotyped by using a TaqMan Genotyping Assay. The 
results were confirmed by DNA sequencing.The rs10877887 polymorphism had reduced 
risks of PTC in heterozygous comparison, dominant model, and overdominant model 
(TC vs TT: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [95% 
CI] = 0.58-0.94, P = 0.01; TC/CC vs TT: adjusted OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63-1.00, 
P = 0.047; TC vs TT/CC: adjusted OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.57-0.92, P = 0.007, 
respectively). Stratified analyses showed that PTC patients carrying the 
rs10877887 CC genotype were more likely to have multiple tumors (adjusted 
OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.03-2.86, P = 0.04), and PTC patients carrying the 
rs13293512 TC + CC or CC were more likely to develop N0 status (TC/CC vs TT: 
adjusted OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43-0.94, P = 0.02; CC vs
TC/TT: adjusted OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.33-0.77, P = 0.001, respectively).Our 
study suggests that the rs10877887 polymorphism may be associated with the risk 
of PTC and the rs13293512 polymorphism may correlate to lymph node metastasis in 
PTC.
