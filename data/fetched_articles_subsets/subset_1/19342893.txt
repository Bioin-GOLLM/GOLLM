Among other signals, cell growth is particularly controlled by the target of 
rapamycin (TOR) pathway that includes the tuberous sclerosis complex genes 
(TSC1/2), and through transcriptional effects regulated by c-myc. Overexpression 
of Drosophila Myc and TSC1/2 cause opposing growth and proliferation defects. 
Despite this relationship, direct regulatory connections between Myc and the TSC 
have only recently been evaluated. Other than studies of p53 regulation, little 
consideration has been given to transcriptional regulation of the TSC genes. 
Here we review evidence that transcriptional controls are potentially important 
regulators of TSC2 expression, and that Myc is a direct repressor of its 
expression. Since tuberin loss de-represses Myc protein, the connection between 
these two growth regulators is positioned to act as a feed-forward loop that 
would amplify the oncogenic effects of decreased tuberin or increased Myc. 
Further experiments will be needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this 
important connection, and evaluate its overall contribution to cancers caused by 
TSC loss or Myc gain.
