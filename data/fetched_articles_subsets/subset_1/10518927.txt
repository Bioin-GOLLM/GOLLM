The Z alpha domain of the human RNA editing enzyme double-stranded RNA deaminase 
I (ADAR1) binds to left-handed Z-DNA with high affinity. We found by analytical 
ultracentrifugation and CD spectroscopy that two Z alpha domains bind to one 
d(CG)3T4(CG)3 hairpin which contains a stem of six base pairs in the Z-DNA 
conformation. Both wild-type Z alpha and a C125S mutant show a mean dissociation 
constant of 30 nM as measured by surface plasmon resonance and analytical 
ultracentrifugation. Our data suggest that short (> or = 6 bp) segments of Z-DNA 
within a gene are able to recruit two ADAR1 enzymes to that particular site.
