OBJECTIVE: In Pakistan, 74% of consanguineous marriages are among the first 
cousins. Continuity of consanguineous marriages over generations increases the 
risk of recessive diseases such as deafness. The objective of this study was to 
investigate genetic origin of Pakistani deaf brothers with parents of 
consanguineous marriage.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from the blood through Qiagen kit. Paired-end 
sequencing library was prepared according to protocol of Illumina's TruSight 
Rapid Capture kit and TruSight Inherited Disease Panel. Library was normalized 
and used for Next Generation Sequencing through MiSeq. NGS data were analyzed 
using various bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: Both brothers were found to have novel deleterious mutation in MYO7A 
(c.2476G>A) while the younger brother had additional novel deleterious mutation 
in TH (c.43C>T) and EVC2 (c.2614C>T) genes.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that in addition to novel mutations in MYO7A, TH and 
EVC2, the CDH23 and GJB2 can also be responsible for deafness in the family with 
consanguineous marriages.
