Ovarian cancer is the second most lethal gynecological cancer worldwide and 
while most patients respond to initial therapy, they often relapse with 
resistant disease. Human epidermal growth factor receptors (especially HER1/EGFR 
and HER2/ERBB2) are involved in disease progression; hence, strategies to 
inhibit their action could prove advantageous in ovarian cancer patients, 
especially in patients resistant to first line therapy. Monoclonal antibodies 
and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are two classes of drugs that act on these 
receptors. They have demonstrated valuable antitumor activity in multiple 
cancers and their possible use in ovarian cancer continues to be studied. In 
this review, we discuss the human epidermal growth factor receptor family; 
review emerging clinical studies on monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors targeting these receptors in ovarian cancer patients; and propose 
future research possibilities in this area.
