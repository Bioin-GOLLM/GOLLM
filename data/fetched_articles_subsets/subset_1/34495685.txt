The mammalian cell nucleus is a highly organized organelle that contains 
membrane-less structures referred to as nuclear bodies (NBs). Some NBs carry 
specific RNA types that play architectural roles in their formation. Here, we 
show two types of RNase-sensitive DBC1-containing NBs, DBC1 nuclear body (DNB) 
in HCT116 cells and Sam68 nuclear body (SNB) in HeLa cells, that exhibit 
phase-separated features and are constructed using RNA polymerase I or II 
transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. We identified additional protein 
components present in DNB by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, some of 
which (DBC1 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L [HNRNPL]) are required 
for DNB formation. The rescue experiment using the truncated HNRNPL mutants 
revealed that two RNA-binding domains and intrinsically disordered regions of 
HNRNPL play significant roles in DNB formation. All these domains of HNRNPL 
promote in vitro droplet formation, suggesting the need for multivalent 
interactions between HNRNPL and RNA as well as proteins in DNB formation.
