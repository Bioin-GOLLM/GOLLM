AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin resistance syndrome is an important risk factor for 
developing premature coronary heart disease. It is a complex syndrome which 
could arise from the interaction of several genes modulated by environmental 
factors. The Trp64Arg polymorphism in the beta3-adrenoreceptor gene has been 
found to be associated with insulin resistance, obesity or with earlier onset of 
Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in different populations. We 
aimed to study whether features of the insulin resistance syndrome are 
associated with this polymorphism in Indo-Mauritian patients with premature 
coronary heart disease.
METHODS: We carried out a case control study using PCR-RFLP techniques, of 
consecutive Indo-Mauritian patients (n = 338) with premature coronary heart 
disease (onset below age of 60 years) and unrelated control subjects (n = 148) 
of the same ethnicity.
RESULTS: In Indo-Mauritian patients with premature coronary heart disease who 
were not treated by beta blockers, triglyceride concentrations were lower 
(median: 1.44 vs 1.93 mmol/l, p < 0.008) and HDL cholesterol concentrations 
higher (mean: 0.98 vs 0.85 mmol/l, p < 0.015) in those carrying the wild type of 
the beta3-adrenoreceptor gene than in those carrying the Trp64Arg variant. The 
latter genotype specific effect on HDL was inverse in patients treated with beta 
blockers.
CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The beta3-adrenoreceptor gene variant seems to 
modulate the effects of beta blockers on triglyceride and HDL cholesterol 
concentrations in this group of Indo-Mauritian population. Dyslipidaemia, a key 
component of the metabolic syndrome has a heterogeneous nature in Indo-Mauritian 
subjects. This potent risk factor for early-onset coronary heart disease is 
influenced by the interaction between genetic and environmental effects.
