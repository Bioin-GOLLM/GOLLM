Cancer cells revamp the regulatory processes that control translation to induce 
tumor-specific translational programs that can adapt to a hostile 
microenvironment as well as withstand anticancer therapeutics. Translational 
initiation has been established as a common downstream effector of numerous 
deregulated signaling pathways that together culminate in prooncogenic 
expression. Other mechanisms, including ribosomal stalling and stress granule 
assembly, also appear to be rewired in the malignant phenotype. Therefore, 
better understanding of the underlying perturbations driving oncogenic 
translation in the transformed state will provide innovative therapeutic 
opportunities. This review highlights deubiquitinating enzymes that are 
activated/dysregulated in hematologic malignancies, thereby altering the 
translational output and contributing to tumorigenesis.
