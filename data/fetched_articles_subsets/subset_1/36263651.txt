OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by the poor sleep quality. 
Whether the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability is related to sleep 
quality among patients with BD is unclear.
METHODS: Fifty-three euthymic patients with BD (24 BD-I and 29 BD-II) and 
sixty-eight healthy controls were enrolled. The Chinese Version of the 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used, and the availability of DAT was 
assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using [99mTc] 
TRODAT-1.
RESULTS: The sleep disturbance component of the PSQI was significantly 
associated with the level of DAT availability among patients with BD.
CONCLUSION: The striatal dopaminergic activity that contributes to resilience to 
adversity was associated with sleep pattern among patients with BD.
