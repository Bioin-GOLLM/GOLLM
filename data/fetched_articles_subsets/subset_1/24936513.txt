Direct sequencing is a popular method to discover mutations in candidate genes 
responsible for hereditary diseases. A certain type of mutation, however, can be 
missed by the method. Here, we report a comprehensive genomic quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to complement the weakness of direct 
sequencing. Upshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS) is a recessively inherited disease 
associated with severe deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity. We previously 
analyzed ADAMTS13 in 47 USS patients using direct sequencing, and 44 of them had 
either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. Then, we sought to reveal 
more extensive defects of ADAMTS13 in the remaining three patients. We 
quantified copy numbers of each ADAMTS13 exon in the patients by using genomic 
qPCR. Each primer pair was designed to contain at least one of the two primers 
used in direct sequencing, to avoid missing any exonic deletions. The qPCR 
demonstrated heterozygous loss of exons 7 and 8 in one patient and exon 27 in 
the other, and further analysis revealed c.746_987+373del1782 and 
c.3751_3892+587del729, respectively. Genomic qPCR provides an effective method 
for identifying extensive defects of the target genes.
