BACKGROUND: Mutations in the KRT6A or KRT16 gene cause pachyonychia congenita 
type 1 (PC-1), while mutations in KRT16 or KRT6C underlie focal palmoplantar 
keratoderma (FPPK). A new classification system of PC has been adopted based on 
the mutated gene. PC rarely presents the symptoms of diffuse plantar 
keratoderma. Mutation in the tail domain of keratins is rarely reported. PC 
combined with fissured tongue has never been described.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations between clinical 
features and gene mutational sites in two unrelated southern Chinese PC 
pedigrees (one family presented with specific fissured tongue, the other with 
diffuse plantar keratoderma).
MATERIALS & METHODS: The whole coding regions of the KRT6A/KRT16/KRT17/KRT6B 
genes were amplified and directly sequenced to detect the mutation. To confirm 
the effect of the IVS8-2A>C mutation in KRT6A at the mRNA level, total RNA from 
the plantar lesion of a patient was extracted and reverse-transcribed to cDNA 
for sequence analysis.
RESULTS: Two novel de novo mutations, a splice acceptor site variant IVS8-2A>C 
(p.S487FfsX72) in KRT6A and a heterozygous substitution c.AA373_374GG (p.N125G) 
within exon 1 of KRT16, were found separately in the two PC families.
CONCLUSION: Genotype-phenotype correlations among PC patients with codon-125 
mutation in KRT16 were established, while the phenotypes caused by the IVS8-2A>C 
mutation in KRT6A need further studies to confirm the rare feature of fissured 
tongue.
