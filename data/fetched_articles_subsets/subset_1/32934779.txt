GATA3 and APOBEC3B are prognostic markers in adrenocortical carcinoma and 
APOBEC3B is directly transcriptionally regulated by GATA3.

Recent evidence has implicated APOBEC3B (Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme 
catalytic subunit 3B) as a source of mutations in breast, bladder, cervical, 
lung, head, and neck cancers. However, the role of APOBEC3B in adrenocortical 
carcinoma (ACC) and the mechanisms through which its expression is regulated in 
cancer are not fully understood. Here, we report that APOBEC3B is overexpressed 
in ACC and it regulates cell proliferation by inducing S phase arrest. We show 
high APOBEC3B expression is associated with a higher copy number gain/loss at 
chromosome 4 and 8 and TP53 mutation rate in ACC. GATA3 was identified as a 
positive regulator of APOBEC3B expression and directly binds the APOBEC3B 
promoter region. Both GATA3 and APOBEC3B expression levels were associated with 
patient survival. Our study provides novel insights into the function and 
regulation of APOBEC3B expression in addition to its known mutagenic ability.
