Understanding cell state transitions and purposefully controlling them to 
improve therapies is a longstanding challenge in biological research and 
medicine. Here, we identify a transcriptional signature that distinguishes 
activated macrophages from TB-susceptible and TB-resistant mice. We then apply 
the cSTAR (cell State Transition Assessment and Regulation) approach to data 
from screening-by-RNA sequencing to identify chemical perturbations that shift 
the. transcriptional state of the TB-susceptible macrophages towards that of 
TB-resistant cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the compounds identified with 
this approach enhance resistance of the TB-susceptible mouse macrophages to 
virulent M. tuberculosis .
