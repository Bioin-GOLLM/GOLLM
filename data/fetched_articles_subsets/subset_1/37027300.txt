The AAA+ NSF complex is responsible for SNARE complex disassembly both before 
and after membrane fusion. Loss of NSF function results in pronounced 
developmental and degenerative defects. In a genetic screen for sensory deficits 
in zebrafish, we identified a mutation in nsf, I209N, that impairs hearing and 
balance in a dosage-dependent manner without accompanying defects in motility, 
myelination, and innervation. In vitro experiments demonstrate that while the 
I209N NSF protein recognizes SNARE complexes, the effects on disassembly are 
dependent upon the type of SNARE complex and I209N concentration. Higher levels 
of I209N protein produce a modest decrease in binary (syntaxin-SNAP-25) SNARE 
complex disassembly and residual ternary (syntaxin-1A-SNAP-25-synaptobrevin-2) 
disassembly, whereas at lower concentrations binary disassembly activity is 
strongly reduced and ternary disassembly activity is absent. Our study suggests 
that the differential effect on disassembly of SNARE complexes leads to 
selective effects on NSF-mediated membrane trafficking and auditory/vestibular 
function.
