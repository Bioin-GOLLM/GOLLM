Residues in the histone substrate binding sites that differ between the KDM4 and 
KDM5 subfamilies were identified. Subsequently, a C8-substituted 
pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one series was designed to rationally exploit these 
residue differences between the histone substrate binding sites in order to 
improve affinity for the KDM4-subfamily over KDM5-subfamily enzymes. In 
particular, residues E169 and V313 (KDM4A numbering) were targeted. 
Additionally, conformational restriction of the flexible pyridopyrimidinone 
C8-substituent was investigated. These approaches yielded potent and 
cell-penetrant dual KDM4/5-subfamily inhibitors including 19a (KDM4A and KDM5B 
Ki = 0.004 and 0.007 μM, respectively). Compound cellular profiling in two 
orthogonal target engagement assays revealed a significant reduction from 
biochemical to cell-based activity across multiple analogues; this decrease was 
shown to be consistent with 2OG competition, and suggests that sub-nanomolar 
biochemical potency will be required with C8-substituted 
pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one compounds to achieve sub-micromolar target 
inhibition in cells.
