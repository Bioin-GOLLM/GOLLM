COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is a global health issue 
with more than 2 million fatalities to date. Viral replication is shaped by the 
cellular microenvironment, and one important factor to consider is oxygen 
tension, in which hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) regulates transcriptional 
responses to hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory 
tract, entering via its spike glycoprotein binding to angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2). We demonstrate that hypoxia and the HIF prolyl hydroxylase 
inhibitor Roxadustat reduce ACE2 expression and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and 
replication in lung epithelial cells via an HIF-1α-dependent pathway. Hypoxia 
and Roxadustat inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication, showing that post-entry steps 
in the viral life cycle are oxygen sensitive. This study highlights the 
importance of HIF signaling in regulating multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 
infection and raises the potential use of HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors in 
the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
