The study of cell-population heterogeneity in a range of biological systems, 
from viruses to bacterial isolates to tumor samples, has been transformed by 
recent advances in sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can 
be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing 
ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing 
errors. We report a method (LoFreq) that models sequencing run-specific error 
rates to accurately call variants occurring in <0.05% of a population. Using 
simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that LoFreq 
has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared 
with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing 
datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present 
experimental validation for LoFreq on two different platforms (Fluidigm and 
Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome 
sequencing datasets for gastric cancer. Source code and executables for LoFreq 
are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/lofreq/.
