PURPOSE: High serum levels of macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1) are 
strongly associated with metastatic prostate cancer, suggesting MIC-1 is a 
biomarker for prostate cancer prognosis.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 1,442 Swedish 
men with a pathologically verified diagnosis of prostate cancer between 2001 and 
2003. Blood was drawn either pretreatment (n = 431) or posttreatment (n = 1,011) 
and cases were followed for a mean time of 4.9 years (range, 0.1-6.8 years).
RESULTS: MIC-1 serum levels independently predicted poor cancer-specific 
survival with an almost 3-fold higher cancer death rate in patients with serum 
levels in the highest quartile compared with men with serum levels in the lowest 
quartile (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.82-4.68). 
Pretreatment MIC-1 levels revealed an even stronger association with disease 
outcome with an 8-fold higher death rate in the highest compared with the lowest 
category (adjusted hazard ratio, 7.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.73-36.86). 
Among patients considered to have localized disease, MIC-1 significantly 
increased the discriminative capacity between indolent and lethal prostate 
cancer compared with the established prognostic markers clinical stage, 
pathologic grade, and prostate-specific antigen level (P = 0.016). A sequence 
variant in the MIC-1 gene was associated with decreased MIC-1 serum levels (P = 
0.002) and decreased prostate cancer mortality (P = 0.003), suggesting a 
causative role of MIC-1 in prostate cancer prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum MIC-1 concentration is a novel biomarker capable of 
predicting prostate cancer prognosis.
