The uptake of Ca2+ into and extrusion of calcium from the mitochondrial matrix, 
regulated by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), is a fundamental biological 
process that has crucial impacts on cellular metabolism, signaling, growth and 
survival. Herein, we report that the embryonic lethality of Mcu-deficient mice 
is fully rescued by orally supplementing ferroptosis inhibitor lipophilic 
antioxidant vitamin E and ubiquinol. Mechanistically, we found MCU promotes 
acetyl-CoA-mediated GPX4 acetylation at K90 residue, and K90R mutation impaired 
the GPX4 enzymatic activity, a step that is crucial for ferroptosis. Structural 
analysis supports the possibility that GPX4 K90R mutation alters the 
conformational state of the molecule, resulting in disruption of a salt bridge 
formation with D23, which was confirmed by mutagenesis studies. Finally, we 
report that deletion of MCU in cancer cells caused a marked reduction in tumor 
growth in multiple cancer models. In summary, our study provides a first direct 
link between mitochondrial calcium level and sustained GPX4 enzymatic activity 
to regulate ferroptosis, which consequently protects cancer cells from 
ferroptosis.
