Most patients with autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) carry rare 
heterozygous STAT3 variants. Only six of the 135 in-frame variants reported have 
been experimentally shown to be dominant negative (DN), and it has been recently 
suggested that eight out-of-frame variants operate by haploinsufficiency. We 
experimentally tested these 143 variants, 7 novel out-of-frame variants found in 
HIES patients, and other STAT3 variants from the general population. Strikingly, 
all 15 out-of-frame variants were DN via their encoded (1) truncated proteins, 
(2) neoproteins generated from a translation reinitiation codon, and (3) 
isoforms from alternative transcripts or a combination thereof. Moreover, 128 of 
the 135 in-frame variants (95%) were also DN. The patients carrying the seven 
non-DN STAT3 in-frame variants have not been studied for other genetic 
etiologies. Finally, none of the variants from the general population tested, 
including an out-of-frame variant, were DN. Overall, our findings show that 
heterozygous STAT3 variants, whether in or out of frame, underlie AD-HIES 
through negative dominance rather than haploinsufficiency.
