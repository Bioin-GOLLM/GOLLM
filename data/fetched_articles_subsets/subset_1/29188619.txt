OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of using PCR-based capillary 
electrophoresis method to analysis mutation of the TOR1A gene in a family 
affected with primary torsion dystonia (PTD).
METHODS: Peripheral blood sample was collected from proband and amnionic fluid 
from her fetus for the extraction of DNA. The 5th exon of the TOR1A gene and its 
flanking sequences were amplified with PCR and analyzed with agarose 
electrophoresis, fluorescence labeled fragment analysis and Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Fluorescence labeled fragment analysis was performed through capillary 
electrophoresis, which showed that the proband carried a c.907_909delGAG 
(p.Glu303del) deletional mutation of the TOR1A gene. The result was verified by 
Sanger sequencing. The fetus DNA was also found with the same mutation by 
capillary electrophoresis, inferring that the fetus was probably affected with 
the disease.
CONCLUSION: The mutation of c.907_909delGAG of the TOR1A gene was speculated as 
pathologic cause of proband in this family. Fragment analysis by capillary 
electrophoresis combined with DNA sequencing is an efficient test for small 
deletional mutations and feasible for its prenatal diagnosis.
