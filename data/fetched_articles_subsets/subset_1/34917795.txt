BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia (PET) is a potentially devastating multi-systemic 
disorder resulting in the generation of oxidative stress. Platelet activation 
causes vasoconstriction and release of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in an 
intensified inflammatory response, endothelial damage, and coagulopathy which 
culminate in adverse pregnancy outcomes.
AIM: To compare the platelet parameters between preeclamptic and normotensive 
pregnant women and their relationship to adverse outcomes in women with 
pre-eclampsia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a case-control study of platelet indices of 60 
pre-eclamptic and 60 normotensive pregnant women recruited at 28 weeks and 
followed till delivery. A blood sample was collected at entry into the study and 
just before delivery. The sample was analyzed within 1 h of collection using the 
Mythic 18 hematological auto-analyzer. Data were analyzed using IBM-SPSS version 
22. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The mean platelet count, Platelet distribution width (PDW), 
plateletcrit were statistically significantly different between normotensive and 
severe preeclamptic participants (p= <0.001). Statistically significant 
differences were not present in any of the platelet parameters between mild and 
severe PET. The odds of developing eclampsia was low at higher mean platelet 
count and plateletcrit levels above 161.36 ± 73.74 × 109/L [p = 0.02, AOR = 
0.27, 95% CI (0.08-0.88)] and 0.13 ± 0.05% [p = 0.001, AOR = 0.22, 95% CI 
(0.08-0.58)] respectively. Eclampsia was strongly associated with P-LCR 
(platelet-large cell ratio) above 23.15 ± 4.92% [p = 0.004, AOR = 11.00, 95%CI 
(1.48-89.02)]. Abruptio placentae had low odds at lower levels of mean 
plateletcrit. Pre-term birth was significantly lower at mean plateletcrit levels 
above 0.14 ± 0.05%; admission into neonatal intensive care unit was strongly 
associated with a mean PLC ratio above 22.73 ± 5.91%.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated significant differences in platelet count, 
plateletcrit, platelet distribution width, and P-LCR between pre-eclamptic and 
normotensive women. Increase in P-LCR is a risk factor for eclampsia although 
the effect size is low.
