Previous studies suggested patients with bipolar depressive disorder (BDd) or 
unipolar depressive disorder (UDd) have cerebral metabolites abnormalities. 
These abnormalities may stem from multiple sub-regions of gray matter in brain 
regions. Thirteen BDd patients, 20â€‰UDd patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) 
were enrolled to investigate these abnormalities. Absolute concentrations of 5 
cerebral metabolites (glutamate-glutamine (Glx), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), 
choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), creatine (Cr), parietal cortex (PC)) were 
measured from 4 subregions (the medial frontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and parietal cortex (PC)) of 
gray matter. Main and interaction effects of cerebral metabolites across 
subregions of gray matter were evaluated. For example, the Glx was significantly 
higher in BDd compared with UDd, and so on. As the interaction analyses showed, 
some interaction effects existed. The concentrations of BDds' Glx, Cho, Cr in 
the ACC and HCs' mI and Cr in the PC were higher than that of other interaction 
effects. In addition, the concentrations of BDds' Glx and Cr in the PC and HCs' 
mI in the ACC were statistically significant lower than that of other 
interaction effects. These findings point to region-related abnormalities of 
cerebral metabolites across subjects with BDd and UDd.
