Background: The aetiology and inflammatory profile of combined pulmonary 
fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) remain uncertain currently. Objective: We aimed to 
examine the levels of inflammatory proteins in lung tissue in a cohort of 
patients with emphysema, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and CPFE. 
Materials and methods: Explanted lungs were obtained from subjects with 
emphysema, IPF, CPFE, (or normal subjects), and tissue extracts were prepared. 
Thirty-four inflammatory proteins were measured in each tissue section. Results: 
The levels of all 34 proteins were virtually indistinguishable in IPF compared 
with CPFE tissues, and collectively, the inflammatory profile in the 
emphysematous tissues were distinct from IPF and CPFE. Moreover, inflammatory 
protein levels were independent of the severity of the level of diseased tissue. 
Conclusions: We find that emphysematous lung tissues have a distinct 
inflammatory profile compared with either IPF or CPFE. However, the inflammatory 
profile in CPFE lungs is essentially identical to lungs from patients with IPF. 
These data suggest that distinct inflammatory processes collectively contribute 
to the disease processes in patients with emphysema, when compared to IPF and 
CPFE.
