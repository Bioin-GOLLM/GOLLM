Many 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins (2-Cys-Prxs) are dual-function proteins, either acting 
as peroxidases under non-stress conditions or as chaperones during stress. The 
mechanism by which 2-Cys-Prxs switch functions remains to be defined. Our work 
focuses on Leishmania infantum mitochondrial 2-Cys-Prx, whose reduced, decameric 
subpopulation adopts chaperone function during heat shock, an activity that 
facilitates the transition from insects to warm-blooded host environments. Here, 
we have solved the cryo-EM structure of mTXNPx in complex with a thermally 
unfolded client protein, and revealed that the flexible N-termini of mTXNPx form 
a well-resolved central belt that contacts and encapsulates the unstructured 
client protein in the center of the decamer ring. In vivo and in vitro 
cross-linking studies provide further support for these interactions, and 
demonstrate that mTXNPx decamers undergo temperature-dependent structural 
rearrangements specifically at the dimer-dimer interfaces. These structural 
changes appear crucial for exposing chaperone-client binding sites that are 
buried in the peroxidase-active protein.
