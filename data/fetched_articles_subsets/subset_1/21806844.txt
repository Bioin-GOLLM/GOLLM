Dasatinib preferentially induces apoptosis by inhibiting Lyn kinase in 
nilotinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cell line.

Nilotinib is approved for treatment of newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) and it is shown superiority over imatinib in first-line treatment for 
patients of CML. In this study, we established a nilotinib-resistant cell line, 
K562NR, and evaluated the resistance to nilotinib and efficacy of dasatinib. We 
found activation of Lyn plays a dominant role in survival of the 
nilotinib-resistant cell line. We found dasatinib induces the apoptosis of 
nilotinib-resistant cells and inhibits Lyn kinase activity. This novel 
nilotinib-resistant CML cell line may help to explore novel therapy for CML.
