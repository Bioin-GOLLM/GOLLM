General cancer-targeted ligands that can deliver drugs to cells have been given 
considerable attention. In this paper, a high-affinity DNA aptamer (HG1) 
generally binding to human tumor cells was evolved by cell-SELEX, and was 
further optimized to have 35 deoxynucleotides (HG1-9). Aptamer HG1-9 could be 
taken up by live cells, and its target protein on a cell was identified to be 
human transferrin receptor (TfR). As a man-made ligand of TfR, aptamer HG1-9 was 
demonstrated to bind at the same site of human TfR as transferrin with 
comparable binding affinity, and was proved to cross the epithelium barrier 
through transferrin receptor-mediated transcytosis. These results suggest that 
aptamer HG1-9 holds potential as a promising ligand to develop general 
cancer-targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.
