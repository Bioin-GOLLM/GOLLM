Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a rare clinically heterogeneous 
genodermatosis due to genetic defects in type VII collagen gene (COL7A1). 
Identification of COL7A1 mutations is a challenge since this gene comprises 118 
exons and more than 300 mutations scattered over the gene have been reported. 
Here, we describe for the first time the use of denaturing high performance 
liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for COL7A1 mutation detection. To validate the 
method, exon-specific DHPLC conditions were applied to screen DNA samples from 
patients carrying known COL7A1 mutations. Abnormal DHPLC profiles were obtained 
for all known mutations. Subsequent DHPLC analysis of 17 DEB families of unknown 
genotype allowed the identification of 21 distinct mutations, 9 of which were 
novel. The DHPLC mutation detection rate was significantly higher compared with 
our mutation scanning rate with conventional techniques (97% vs 86%), indicating 
DHPLC as the method of choice for COL7A1 molecular characterization in DEB 
patients.
