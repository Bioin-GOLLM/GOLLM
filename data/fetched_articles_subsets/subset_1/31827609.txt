BACKGROUND: The hydrotreatment of oleochemical/lipid feedstocks is currently the 
only technology that provides significant volumes (millions of litres per year) 
of "conventional" biojet/sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, if biojet 
fuels are to be produced in sustainably sourced volumes (billions of litres per 
year) at a price comparable with fossil jet fuel, biomass-derived "advanced" 
biojet fuels will be needed. Three direct thermochemical liquefaction 
technologies, fast pyrolysis, catalytic fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal 
liquefaction were assessed for their potential to produce "biocrudes" which were 
subsequently upgraded to drop-in biofuels by either dedicated hydrotreatment or 
co-processed hydrotreatment.
RESULTS: A significant biojet fraction (between 20.8 and 36.6% of total upgraded 
fuel volume) was produced by all of the processes. When the fractions were 
assessed against general ASTM D7566 specifications they showed significant 
compliance, despite a lack of optimization in any of the process steps. When the 
life cycle analysis GHGenius model was used to assess the carbon intensity of 
the various products, significant emission reductions (up to 74%) could be 
achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: It was apparent that the production of biojet fuels based on direct 
thermochemical liquefaction of biocrudes, followed by hydrotreating, has 
considerable potential.
