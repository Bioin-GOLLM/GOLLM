Although gene-gene interaction, or epistasis, plays a large role in complex 
traits in model organisms, genome-wide by genome-wide searches for two-way 
interaction have limited power in human studies. We thus used knowledge of a 
biological pathway in order to identify a contribution of epistasis to autism 
spectrum disorders (ASDs) in humans, a reverse-pathway genetic approach. Based 
on previous observation of increased ASD symptoms in Mendelian disorders of the 
Ras/MAPK pathway (RASopathies), we showed that common SNPs in RASopathy genes 
show enrichment for association signal in GWAS (P = 0.02). We then screened 
genome-wide for interactors with RASopathy gene SNPs and showed strong 
enrichment in ASD-affected individuals (P < 2.2 x 10-16), with a number of 
pairwise interactions meeting genome-wide criteria for significance. Finally, we 
utilized quantitative measures of ASD symptoms in RASopathy-affected individuals 
to perform modifier mapping via GWAS. One top region overlapped between these 
independent approaches, and we showed dysregulation of a gene in this region, 
GPR141, in a RASopathy neural cell line. We thus used orthogonal approaches to 
provide strong evidence for a contribution of epistasis to ASDs, confirm a role 
for the Ras/MAPK pathway in idiopathic ASDs, and to identify a convergent 
candidate gene that may interact with the Ras/MAPK pathway.
