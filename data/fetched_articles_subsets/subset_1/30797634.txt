BACKGROUND: There is no licensed vaccine against enterotoxigenic Escherichia 
coli (ETEC), a major cause of diarrhea-associated morbidity and mortality among 
infants and children in low-income countries and travelers. The results of this 
vaccination/challenge study demonstrate strong protection by an attenuated ETEC 
vaccine candidate, ACE527, when co-administered with a mucosal adjuvant, the 
double-mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) of ETEC.
METHODS: Sixty healthy adults participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
double-blind study with three doses of lyophilized ACE527 (∼3 × 109 of each 
strain per dose) administered orally with or without dmLT adjuvant (25 µg/dose). 
Six months later, 36 of these volunteers and a control group of 21 unvaccinated 
volunteers were challenged with virulent ETEC strain H10407. The primary outcome 
was severe diarrhea, defined as passing >800 g of unformed stools during the 
inpatient period following challenge.
FINDINGS: The vaccine was well tolerated and induced robust immune responses to 
key antigens. The protective efficacy (PE) against the primary outcome of severe 
diarrhea was 65.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.4-87.7, p = 0.003). Among 
subjects receiving the adjuvanted vaccine, the attack rate of severe diarrhea 
was 23.1, while in unimmunized controls it was 67.7%. The PE against diarrhea of 
any severity was 58.5% (95% CI 3.8- 82.1, p = 0.016). There was a strong inverse 
correlation between shedding of the vaccine strain after either of the first two 
doses and absence of severe diarrhea upon challenge (RR = 0.29, 95% CI 
0.08-1.05, p = 0.041). Challenge strain shedding was 10-fold lower in those 
receiving the adjuvant than in those receiving vaccine alone. The unadjuvanted 
vaccine was not protective (PE = 23.1%).
INTERPRETATION: The results of this study support further development of 
ACE527 + dmLT as a vaccine for children in endemic countries and travelers. This 
is the first clinical demonstration that dmLT can contribute significantly to 
vaccine efficacy and may warrant testing with other oral vaccines.
