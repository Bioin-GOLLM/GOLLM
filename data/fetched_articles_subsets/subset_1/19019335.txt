OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to study the genetic risk factors of 
spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) in African Americans.
STUDY DESIGN: Case-control analyses were performed using maternal and fetal 
deoxyribonucleic acid from 279 African American birth events (82 PTB and 197 
term) and 1432 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 130 candidate genes. 
Single-locus association and haplotype analyses were performed.
RESULTS: The most significant associations were in the maternal interleukin 
(IL)-15 (rs10833, allele P = 2.91 x 10(-4), genotype P = 2.00 x 10(-3)) gene and 
the fetal IL-2 receptor B (IL-2RB) (rs84460, allele P = 1.37 x 10(-4), genotype 
P = 6.29 x 10(-4)) gene. The best models for these markers were additive 
(rs10833, odds ratio [OR], 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.62; P = 
1.0 x 10(-3); rs84460, OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.47-3.67; P < 1.0 x 10(-3)). The 
largest number of significant associations was found in genes related to 
infection and inflammation. There were overall a larger number of significant 
associations in infants than in mothers.
CONCLUSION: These results support a strong role for genes involved in infection 
and inflammation in the pathogenesis of PTB, particularly IL-12 and IL-12RB, and 
indicate that in African Americans there may be complementarity of maternal and 
fetal genetic risks for PTB.
