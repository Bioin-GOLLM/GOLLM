BACKGROUND: The endothelium plays a pivotal role in homeostatic mechanisms. It 
specifically modulates vascular tone by releasing vasodilatory mediators, which 
act on the vascular smooth muscle. Large amounts of work have been dedicated 
towards identifying mediators of vasodilation and vasoconstriction alongside the 
deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species on the endothelium. We conducted 
a systematic review to study the role of the factors released by the endothelium 
and the effects on the vessels alongside its role in atherosclerosis.
METHODS: A search was conducted with appropriate search terms. Specific 
attention was offered to the effects of emerging modulators of endothelial 
functions focusing the analysis on studies that investigated the role of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), perivascular adipose tissue, shear stress, 
AMP-activated protein kinase, potassium channels, bone morphogenic protein 4, 
and P2Y2 receptor.
RESULTS: 530 citations were reviewed, with 35 studies included in the final 
systematic review. The endpoints were evaluated in these studies which offered 
an extensive discussion on emerging modulators of endothelial functions. 
Specific factors such as reactive oxygen species had deleterious effects, 
especially in the obese and elderly. Another important finding included the 
shear stress-induced endothelial nitric oxide (NO), which may delay development 
of atherosclerosis. Perivascular Adipose Tissue (PVAT) also contributes to 
reparative measures against atherosclerosis, although this may turn pathological 
in obese subjects. Some of these factors may be targets for pharmaceutical 
agents in the near future.
CONCLUSION: The complex role and function of the endothelium is vital for 
regular homeostasis. Dysregulation may drive atherogenesis; thus, efforts should 
be placed at considering therapeutic options by targeting some of the factors 
noted.
