PURPOSE: To examine whether promiscuous Cre/LoxP recombination happens during 
gametogenesis in double transgenic mice carrying LoxP modified alleles and Cre 
transgene driven by tissue-specific promoter outside the gonads of adult mice.
METHODS: Cre driver mice were crossbred with reporter mouse lines (e.g., ZEG and 
Rosa26R) to obtain Cre/ZEG and Cre/Rosa26R double transgenic mice. The frequency 
of promiscuous LoxP/Cre recombination was determined by the expression of second 
reporter genes in the offspring of double transgenic mice.
RESULTS: The frequency of promiscuous LoxP/Cre recombination varied in different 
lines of Cre driver mice and in the sex of the same driver mice with higher 
penetrance in male than in female double transgenic mice. Polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and recombination analysis demonstrate that the recombination of 
floxed allele occurs during the transition from spermatogonia (diploid) to 
primary spermatocyte (tetraploid) in the testis. Thereby, target-floxed 
allele(s) may be ubiquitously ablated in experimental animals intended for 
tissue-specific gene deletion.
CONCLUSIONS: Gametogenesis-associated recombination should always be examined in 
tissue-specific gene ablation studies.
