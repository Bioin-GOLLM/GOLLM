Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) of Escherichia coli is an AB5 class bacterial toxin. 
The pentameric B subunit (SubB) binds the cellular carbohydrate receptor, 
α2-3-linked N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Neu5Gc is not expressed on 
normal human cells, but is expressed by cancer cells. Elevated Neu5Gc has been 
observed in breast, ovarian, prostate, colon and lung cancer. The presence of 
Neu5Gc is prognostically important, and correlates with invasiveness, metastasis 
and tumour grade. Neu5Gc binding by SubB suggests that it may have utility as a 
diagnostic tool for the detection Neu5Gc tumor antigens. Native SubB has 20-fold 
less binding to N-acetlylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac); over 30-fold less if the 
Neu5Gc linkage was changed from α2-3 to α2-6. Using molecular modeling 
approaches, site directed mutations were made to reduce the α2-3 [Formula: see 
text] α2-6-linkage preference, while maintaining or enhancing the selectivity of 
SubB for Neu5Gc over Neu5Ac. Surface plasmon resonance and glycan array analysis 
showed that the SubBΔS106/ΔT107 mutant displayed improved specificity towards 
Neu5Gc and bound to α2-6-linked Neu5Gc. SubBΔS106/ΔT107 could discriminate 
NeuGc- over Neu5Ac-glycoconjugates in ELISA. These data suggest that improved 
SubB mutants offer a new tool for the testing of biological samples, 
particularly serum and other fluids from individuals with cancer or suspected of 
having cancer.
