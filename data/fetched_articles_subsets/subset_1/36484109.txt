Rpc31 is a subunit in the TFIIE-related Rpc82/34/31 heterotrimeric subcomplex of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase III (pol III). Structural analyses of 
pol III have indicated that the N-terminal region of Rpc31 anchors on Rpc82 and 
further interacts with the polymerase core and stalk subcomplex. However, 
structural and functional information for the C-terminal region of Rpc31 is 
sparse. We conducted a mutational analysis on Rpc31, which uncovered a 
functional peptide adjacent to the highly conserved Asp-Glu-rich acidic 
C-terminus. This C-terminal peptide region, termed 'pre-acidic', is important 
for optimal cell growth, tRNA synthesis, and stable association of Rpc31 in the 
pre-initiation complex (PIC). Our site-directed photo-cross-linking to map 
protein interactions within the PIC reveal that this pre-acidic region 
specifically targets Rpc34 during transcription initiation, but also interacts 
with the DNA entry surface in free pol III. Thus, we have uncovered a switchable 
Rpc31 C-terminal region that functions in an initiation-specific protein 
interaction for pol III transcription.
