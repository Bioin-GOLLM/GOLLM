For sputum analysis, the transfer of inflammatory cells from liquefied sputum 
samples to a culture medium or buffer solution is a critical step because it 
removes the inflammatory cells from the presence of residual dithiothreitol 
(DTT), a reagent that reduces cell viability and interferes with further sputum 
analyses. In this work, we report an acoustofluidic platform for transferring 
inflammatory cells using standing surface acoustic waves (SSAW). In particular, 
we exploit the acoustic radiation force generated from a SSAW field to actively 
transfer inflammatory cells from a solution containing residual DTT to a buffer 
solution. The viability and integrity of the inflammatory cells are maintained 
during the acoustofluidic-based cell transfer process. Our acoustofluidic 
technique removes residual DTT generated in sputum liquefaction and facilitates 
immunophenotyping of major inflammatory cells from sputum samples. It enables 
cell transfer in a continuous flow, which aids the development of an automated, 
integrated system for on-chip sputum processing and analysis.
