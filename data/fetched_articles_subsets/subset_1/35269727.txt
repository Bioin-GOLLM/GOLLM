Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) inhibits host oxidative stress responses 
facilitating its survival in macrophages; however, the underlying molecular 
mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we identified a Mtb acetyltransferase 
(Rv3034c) as a novel counter actor of macrophage oxidative stress responses by 
inducing peroxisome formation. An inducible Rv3034c deletion mutant of Mtb 
failed to induce peroxisome biogenesis, expression of the peroxisomal 
β-oxidation pathway intermediates (ACOX1, ACAA1, MFP2) in macrophages, resulting 
in reduced intracellular survival compared to the parental strain. This reduced 
virulence phenotype was rescued by repletion of Rv3034c. Peroxisome induction 
depended on the interaction between Rv3034c and the macrophage mannose receptor 
(MR). Interaction between Rv3034c and MR induced expression of the peroxisomal 
biogenesis proteins PEX5p, PEX13p, PEX14p, PEX11β, PEX19p, the peroxisomal 
membrane lipid transporter ABCD3, and catalase. Expression of PEX14p and ABCD3 
was also enhanced in lungs from Mtb aerosol-infected mice. This is the first 
report that peroxisome-mediated control of ROS balance is essential for innate 
immune responses to Mtb but can be counteracted by the mycobacterial 
acetyltransferase Rv3034c. Thus, peroxisomes represent interesting targets for 
host-directed therapeutics to tuberculosis.
