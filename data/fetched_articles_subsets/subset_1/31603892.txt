Muscle development and lipid accumulation in muscle critically affect meat 
quality of livestock. However, the genetic factors underlying myofiber-type 
specification and intramuscular fat (IMF) accumulation remain to be elucidated. 
Using two independent intercrosses between Western commercial breeds and Korean 
native pigs (KNPs) and a joint linkage-linkage disequilibrium analysis, we 
identified a 488.1-kb region on porcine chromosome 12 that affects both reddish 
meat color (a*) and IMF. In this critical region, only the MYH3 gene, encoding 
myosin heavy chain 3, was found to be preferentially overexpressed in the 
skeletal muscle of KNPs. Subsequently, MYH3-transgenic mice demonstrated that 
this gene controls both myofiber-type specification and adipogenesis in skeletal 
muscle. We discovered a structural variant in the promotor/regulatory region of 
MYH3 for which Q allele carriers exhibited significantly higher values of a* and 
IMF than q allele carriers. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and 
cotransfection assays showed that the structural variant in the 5'-flanking 
region of MYH3 abrogated the binding of the myogenic regulatory factors (MYF5, 
MYOD, MYOG, and MRF4). The allele distribution of MYH3 among pig populations 
worldwide indicated that the MYH3 Q allele is of Asian origin and likely 
predates domestication. In conclusion, we identified a functional regulatory 
sequence variant in porcine MYH3 that provides novel insights into the genetic 
basis of the regulation of myofiber type ratios and associated changes in IMF in 
pigs. The MYH3 variant can play an important role in improving pork quality in 
current breeding programs.
