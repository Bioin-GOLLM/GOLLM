Transmembrane proteins participate in various physiological activities in 
plants, including signal transduction, substance transport, and energy 
conversion. Although more than 20% of gene products are predicted to be 
transmembrane proteins in the genome era, due to the complexity of transmembrane 
domains they are difficult to reliably identify in the predicted protein, and 
they may have different overall three-dimensional structures. Therefore, it is 
challenging to study their biological function. In this review, we describe the 
typical structures of transmembrane proteins and their roles in plant growth, 
development, and stress responses. We propose a model illustrating the roles of 
transmembrane proteins during plant growth and response to various stresses, 
which will provide important references for crop breeding.
