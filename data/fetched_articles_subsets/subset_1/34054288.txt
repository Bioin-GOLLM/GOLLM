PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will summarize the distinction between 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and exercise-induced cardiac remodeling 
(EICR), describe treatments of particular relevance to athletes with HCM, and 
highlight the evolution of recommendations for exercise and competitive sport 
participation relevant to individuals with HCM.
RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas prior guidelines have excluded individuals with HCM 
from more than mild-intensity exercise, recent data show that moderate-intensity 
exercise improves functional capacity and indices of cardiac function and 
continuation of competitive sports may not be associated with worse outcomes. 
Moreover, recent studies of athletes with implantable cardioverter 
defibrillators (ICDs) demonstrated a safer profile than previously understood. 
In this context, the updated American Heart Association/American College of 
Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HCM guidelines 
have increased focus on shared decision-making and liberalized restrictions on 
exercise and sport participation among individuals with HCM.
SUMMARY: New data demonstrating the safety of exercise in individuals with HCM 
and in athletes with ICDs, in addition to a focus on shared decision-making, 
have led to the most updated guidelines easing restrictions on exercise and 
competitive athletics in this population. Further athlete-specific studies of 
HCM, especially in the context of emerging therapies such as mavacamten, are 
important to inform accurate risk stratification and eligibility 
recommendations.
