BACKGROUND: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder most commonly caused by defects in the CYP21A2 gene. Neonatal 
CAH-screening based on 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) measurements prevents 
life-threatening salt wasting conditions in newborns, but results in a 
considerable false-positive rate. Therefore, efficient second tier tests are 
required.
METHODS: We developed a reverse-hybridization test strip-based assay (CAH 
StripAssay) covering the most prevalent CYP21A2 point mutations/small 
insertions/deletions occurring in Middle European populations. Assay specificity 
was validated using plasmid clones, and wild-type and mutant reference DNAs. Its 
practicability was evaluated in 271 samples from patients with CAH, suspected 
CAH, and dried blood spots from screening-positive newborns.
RESULTS: All eleven point mutations and 51% of large deletions/conversions could 
be unambiguously identified when compared to reference methods (DNA sequencing, 
MLPA). After exclusion of rare mutations (6.4%) not covered by the StripAssay, 
the overall detection rate was 85%. Undetected heterozygous 
deletions/conversions caused a lack of information, but did not result in an 
incorrect prediction of phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel CAH StripAssay proved to be a fast (7h) and reliable 
method for detection of common CYP21A2 mutations. Implemented as a second-tier 
test in CAH newborn screening, it has the potential to significantly reduce 
recall rates.
