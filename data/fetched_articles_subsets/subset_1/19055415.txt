Four "one-bead one-compound" (OBOC) combinatorial libraries were designed, 
synthesized, and screened against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. A novel cyclic 
peptide 1 (LXY1) with high binding specificity to alpha3 integrin was 
identified. Molecular interactions between alpha3 integrin and 1 were 
characterized by using a series of K562 cells transfected with various mutant 
alpha3 integrins. Using analytic flow cytometry, the binding affinity (K(d)) of 
1 to alpha3 integrin on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was determined to be 
approximately 0.4 microM. Based on the established structure-activity 
relationship (SAR) study, two highly focused cyclic peptide libraries were 
further designed, synthesized, and screened against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 
cells under stringent conditions. A novel cyclic peptide 2 (LXY3) with a high 
binding affinity (IC(50) = 57 nM) was identified. Moreover, the targeting 
efficiency and specificity of 2 to the breast adenocarcinoma tumors in mouse 
xenografts were further confirmed by in vivo and ex vivo near-infrared 
fluorescence optical imaging.
