INTRODUCTION: Murine microglia expressing the Alzheimer's disease-linked 
TREM2R47H mutation display variable decrease in phagocytosis, while impaired 
phagocytosis is reported following loss of TREM2. However, no data exist on 
TREM2+/R47H human microglia. Therefore, we created human pluripotent stem cell 
(hPSC) monocytes and transdifferentiated microglia-like cells (tMGs) to examine 
the effect of the TREM2+/R47H mutation and loss of TREM2 on phagocytosis.
METHODS: We generated isogenic TREM2+/R47H, TREM2+/-, and TREM2-/- hPSCs using 
CRISPR/Cas9. Following differentiation to monocytes and tMGs, we studied the 
uptake of Escherichia coli fragments and analyzed amyloid plaque clearance from 
cryosections of APP/PS1+/- mouse brains.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that tMGs resemble cultured human microglia. TREM2+/- 
and TREM2-/- hPSC monocytes and tMGs phagocytosed significantly less E. coli 
fragments and cleared less amyloid plaques than wild-type hPSC progeny, with no 
difference for TREM2+/R47H progeny.
DISCUSSION: In vitro phagocytosis of hPSC monocytes and tMGs was not affected by 
the TREM2+/R47H mutation but was significantly impaired in TREM2+/- and TREM2-/- 
progeny.
