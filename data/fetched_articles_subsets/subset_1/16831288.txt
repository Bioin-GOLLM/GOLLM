BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene play 
an important role in the development of cervical cancer. This study was to 
screen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HLA-DQA1 gene involved in 
susceptibility of cervical cancer by a bioinformatics approach, and analyze 
their correlations to abnormal gene functions.
METHODS: SNPs of HLA-DQA1 were screened from a public database dbSNP by SNPper 
software, and relevant FASTA subsequences were also obtained from dbSNP. 
PARSESNP software was used to analyze cSNPs.
RESULTS: Two SNPs, rs9272693 and rs9272703, which may induce mis-sense mutation, 
were identified in codon region of HLA-DQA1 gene. A PSSM difference>10 was used 
to predict deleterious mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: SNPper software in combination with PARSESNP software could be used 
to analyze SNPs of HLA-DQA1 gene and select the variants in a conserved region, 
and it provides an evaluation criterion. But the results need to be verified in 
cervical cancer patients and control populations.
