People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) were considered to be clinically vulnerable 
to COVID-19 and were therefore given priority in the vaccination campaign. 
Vaccines induced a humoral response in these patients that was comparable to the 
response observed among the general population. However, the role of the 
cell-mediated immune response in providing long-term protection against 
SARS-CoV-2 in pwCF has not yet been defined. In this study, humoral (antibody 
titre) and cell-mediated immune responses (interferon-γ release) to the BNT162b2 
vaccine were measured at different time points, from around 6-8 months after the 
2nd dose and up to 8 months after the 3rd dose, in 118 CF patients and 26 non-CF 
subjects. Subjects were sampled between November 2021 and September 2022 and 
followed-up for breakthrough infection through October 2022. pwCF mounted a 
cell-mediated response that was similar to that observed in non-CF subjects. Low 
antibody titres (<1st quartile) were associated with a higher risk of 
breakthrough infection (HR: 2.39, 95 % CI: 1.17-4.88), while there was no 
significant association with low INF-γ levels (<0.3 IU/mL) (HR: 1.38, 95 % CI: 
0.64-2.99). Further studies are needed in subgroup of pwCF receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy, such as organ transplant recipients. This data is 
important for tailoring vaccination strategies for this clinically vulnerable 
population.
