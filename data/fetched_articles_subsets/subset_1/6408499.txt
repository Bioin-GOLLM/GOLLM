Lysosomal glycogen storage disease without acid maltase deficiency.

We studied two brothers with lysosomal glycogen storage disease without acid 
maltase deficiency in skeletal muscle. Although no specific biochemical defect 
was identified, a characteristic clinical picture emerged from evaluation of 
these siblings and two other previously reported patients. The syndrome is 
manifested by proximal muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, probable 
intellectual impairment, and possible liver involvement.
