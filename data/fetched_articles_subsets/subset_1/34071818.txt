Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common driver of 
cancer-related death globally, with an estimated 72% of cases in Asia. For more 
than a decade, first-line systemic treatments for advanced or unresectable HCC 
were limited to the multi-targeted kinase inhibitors sorafenib and, more 
recently, lenvatinib. Now, treatment options have expanded to include 
immunotherapy, as exemplified by the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) 
atezolizumab combined with the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. Additional 
combinations of ICIs with kinase inhibitors, other ICIs, or antiangiogenic 
agents are under investigation, further supporting the new era of immunotherapy 
for first-line treatment of advanced or unresectable HCC. We describe this 
evolving landscape and provide expert opinion on therapeutic best practices in 
the Asia-Pacific region, where different costs of, and patient access to, 
treatment are a challenge. With the combination of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
likely to become the clinical standard of care, optimising treatment sequence 
and ensuring patient access to newer therapies remain priorities. Cost 
containment and treatment sequencing may be facilitated by characterisation of 
predictive positive and negative biomarkers. With these considerations in mind, 
this review and expert opinion focused on advanced HCC in the Asia-Pacific 
region offers perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including physicians, payer 
systems, and patients.
