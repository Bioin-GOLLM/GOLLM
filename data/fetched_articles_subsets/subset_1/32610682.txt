Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (vAMD), characterized by the 
neo-vascularization of the retro-foveolar choroid, leads to blindness within few 
years. This disease depends on angiogenesis mediated by the vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF) and to inflammation. The only available treatments 
consist of monthly intravitreal injections of antibodies directed against VEGF 
or VEGF/VEGFB/PlGF decoy receptors. Despite their relative efficacy, these drugs 
only delay progression to blindness and 30% of the patients are insensitive to 
these treatments. Hence, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. 
Experimental models of vAMD are essential to screen different innovative 
therapeutics. The currently used in vitro and in vivo models in ophthalmic 
translational research and their relevance are discussed in this review.
