BACKGROUND: Exenatide once weekly, an injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 
receptor agonist, has been shown to reduce A1C, fasting glucose, and body weight 
in patients with type 2 diabetes. Exenatide 2.0 mg is dispersed in 
poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer microspheres, which require resuspension 
in aqueous diluent before subcutaneous injection. A single-use, dual-chamber pen 
was developed to improve the convenience of exenatide once weekly delivery and 
tested following Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance.
METHODS: Design development goals were established, and validation tests (dose 
accuracy, torque/force requirements, usability, and ease-of-use) were performed. 
Dose accuracy was tested under a variety of conditions. After 10 exploratory 
studies in 329 patients, the final design's usability and ease-of-use were 
tested in untrained health care practitioners (HCPs; n = 16) and 
untrained/trained patients (n = 30/17). Usability testing evaluated completion 
of multiple setup, dose preparation, and injection steps. Ease-of-use impression 
was assessed using a scale of 1-7 (1 = very difficult, 7 = very easy).
RESULTS: The dual-chamber pen successfully met development goals and delivered 
target volume (650 µL ± 10%) under tested conditions (mean 644.7-649.3 µL), with 
torque and force requirements below prespecified maximum values. In the final 
user study, most participants (≥87%) correctly completed pen setup, dose 
preparation, and injection steps. Mean ease-of-use scores were 5.8, 6.3, and 6.5 
out of 7 in untrained HCPs, untrained patients, and trained patients, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: With self-education or minimal training, participants accurately and 
precisely suspended, mixed, and delivered exenatide-containing microspheres 
using the dual-chamber pen with high ease-of-use scores. The dual-chamber pen 
was FDA-approved in February 2014.
