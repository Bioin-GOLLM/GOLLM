The Protein Kinase Receptor type 2 (RIPK2) plays an important role in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases; it signals downstream of the NOD1 and 
NOD2 intracellular sensors and promotes a productive inflammatory response. 
However, excessive NOD2 signaling has been associated with various diseases, 
including sarcoidosis and inflammatory arthritis; the pharmacological inhibition 
of RIPK2 is an affinity strategy that demonstrates an increased expression of 
pro-inflammatory secretion activity. In this study, a pharmacophoric model based 
on the crystallographic pose of ponatinib, a potent RIPK2 inhibitor, and 30 
other ones selected from the BindingDB repository database, was built. Compounds 
were selected based on the available ZINC compounds database and in silico 
predictions of their pharmacokinetic, toxicity and potential biological 
activity. Molecular docking was performed to identify the probable interactions 
of the compounds as well as their binding affinity with RIPK2. The compounds 
were analyzed to ponatinib and WEHI-345, which also used as a control. At least 
one of the compounds exhibited suitable pharmacokinetic properties, low toxicity 
and an interesting binding affinity and high fitness compared with the 
crystallographic pose of WEHI-345 in complex with RIPK2. This compound also 
possessed suitable synthetic accessibility, rendering it a potential and very 
promising RIPK2 inhibitor to be further investigated in regards to different 
diseases, particularly inflammatory ones.
