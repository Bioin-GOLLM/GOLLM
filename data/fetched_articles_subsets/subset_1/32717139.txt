Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in several processes relevant 
to carcinogenesis. We used 416 single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly 
associated with serum IGF-1 levels to assess the potential causal associations 
between this hormone and site-specific cancers through Mendelian randomization. 
Summary-level genetic association estimates for prostate, breast, ovarian, and 
lung cancer were obtained from large-scale consortia including individuals of 
European-descent. Furthermore, we estimated genetic associations with 14 
site-specific cancers in European-descent individuals in UK Biobank. 
Supplementary analyses were conducted for six site-specific cancers using 
summary-level data from the BioBank Japan Project. Genetically predicted serum 
IGF-1 levels were associated with colorectal cancer. The odds ratio (OR) per 
standard deviation increase of IGF-1 levels was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.01-1.22; P = .03) in UK Biobank and 1.22 (95% CI 1.09-1.36; 
P = 3.9 × 10-4 ) in the BioBank Japan Project. For prostate cancer, the 
corresponding OR was 1.10 (95% CI 1.01-1.21; P = .04) in UK Biobank, 1.03 (95% 
CI 0.97-1.09; P = .41) in the prostate cancer consortium, and 1.08 (95% CI 
0.95-1.22; P = .24) in the BioBank Japan Project. For breast cancer, the 
corresponding OR was 0.99 (95% CI 0.92-1.07; P = .85) in UK Biobank and 1.08 
(95% CI 1.02-1.13; P = 4.4 × 10-3 ) in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. 
There was no statistically significant association between genetically predicted 
IGF-1 levels and 14 other cancers. This study found some support for a causal 
association between elevated serum IGF-1 levels and increased risk of colorectal 
cancer. There was inconclusive or no evidence of a causal association of IGF-1 
levels with prostate, breast, and other cancers.
