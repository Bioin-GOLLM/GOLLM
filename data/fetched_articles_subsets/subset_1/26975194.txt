The rich club comprises a densely mutually connected set of hub regions in the 
brain, thought to serve as a processing and integration core. We assessed the 
impact of normal variation of the tryptophane hydroxylase 2 gene's promotor 
region (TPH2 rs4570625) on structural connectivity of the rich club pathways by 
means of a candidate gene association design. Tryptophane hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) 
is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin and is known to 
inhibit, in addition to its role as a trans-synaptic messenger, axonal and 
dendritic growth. The TPH2 T-variant has been associated with reduced mRNA 
expression and reduced serotonin levels, which may particularly influence the 
development of macroscale anatomical connectivity. Here, we show larger mean 
connectivity in the rich club in carriers of the T-variant, suggesting potential 
effects of upregulation of neural connectivity growth in this central core 
system. In addition, by edge-removal statistics, we show that the 
TPH2-associated higher levels of rich club connectivity are of importance for 
the functioning of the total structural network. The observed association is 
speculated to result from an effect of serotonin levels on brain development, 
potentially leading to stronger structural connectivity in heavily 
interconnected hubs.
