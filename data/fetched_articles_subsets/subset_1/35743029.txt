P2X receptors belong to a family of cation channel proteins, which respond to 
extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). These receptors have gained 
increasing attention in basic and translational research, as they are central to 
a variety of important pathophysiological processes such as the modulation of 
cardiovascular physiology, mediation of nociception, platelet and macrophage 
activation, or neuronal-glial integration. While P2X1 receptor activation is 
long known to drive platelet aggregation, P2X7 receptor antagonists have 
recently been reported to inhibit platelet activation. Considering the role of 
both P2X receptors and platelet-mediated inflammation in neuronal diseases such 
as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, 
targeting purinergic receptors may provide a valuable novel therapeutic approach 
in these diseases. Therefore, the present review illuminates the role of 
platelets and purinergic signaling in these neurological conditions to evaluate 
potential translational implications.
