To analyze the impact of various technical details on the results of quantum 
mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) enzyme simulations, including the QM 
region size, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is studied as a model system 
using an approximate QM/MM method (DFTB3/CHARMM). The results show that key 
equilibrium and kinetic properties for methyl transfer in COMT exhibit limited 
variations with respect to the size of the QM region, which ranges from ∼100 to 
∼500 atoms in this study. With extensive sampling, local and global structural 
characteristics of the enzyme are largely conserved across the studied QM 
regions, while the nature of the transition state (e.g., secondary kinetic 
isotope effect) and reaction exergonicity are largely maintained. Deviations in 
the free energy profile with different QM region sizes are similar in magnitude 
to those observed with changes in other simulation protocols, such as different 
initial enzyme conformations and boundary conditions. Electronic structural 
properties, such as the covariance matrix of residual charge fluctuations, 
appear to exhibit rather long-range correlations, especially when the peptide 
backbone is included in the QM region; this observation holds when a 
range-separated DFT approach is used as the QM region, suggesting that 
delocalization error is unlikely the origin. Overall, the analyses suggest that 
multiple simulation details determine the results of QM/MM enzyme simulations 
with comparable contributions.
