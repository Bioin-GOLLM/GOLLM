Protein gradients play a central role in the spatial organization of cells, but 
the mechanisms of their formation are incompletely understood. This study 
analyzes the determinants responsible for establishing bipolar gradients of the 
ATPase MipZ, a key regulator of division site placement in Caulobacter 
crescentus. We have solved the crystal structure of MipZ in different nucleotide 
states, dissected its ATPase cycle, and investigated its interaction with FtsZ, 
ParB, and the nucleoid. Our results suggest that the polar ParB complexes 
locally stimulate the formation of ATP-bound MipZ dimers, which are then 
retained near the cell poles through association with chromosomal DNA. Due to 
their intrinsic ATPase activity, dimers eventually dissociate into freely 
diffusible monomers that undergo spontaneous nucleotide exchange and are 
recaptured by ParB. These findings clarify the molecular function of a conserved 
gradient-forming system and reveal mechanistic principles that might be commonly 
used to sustain protein gradients within cells.
