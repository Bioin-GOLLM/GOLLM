Comment in
    Undernutrition combined with dietary mineral oil hastens depuration of 
stored dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyls in ewes. 1. Kinetics in blood, 
adipose tissue and faeces.

Food safety crises involving persistent organic pollutants (POPs) lead to 
systematic slaughter of livestock to prevent contaminants from entering the food 
chain. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies to depurate livestock 
moderately contaminated with POPs to reduce economic and social damage. This 
study aimed to test undernutrition (37% of energy requirements) combined with 
mineral oil (10% in total dry matter intake) in nine non-lactating ewes 
contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and polychlorinated 
biphenyls (PCBs) 126 and 153 as a strategy to enhance the depuration of POPs 
through faecal excretion. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the 
depuration process, lipophilic POPs and lipid fluxes were co-monitored in 
various body and excretion compartments. Body compartments (adipose tissues, 
muscle, liver and blood) and the total empty body were analyzed for lipids and 
POPs concentrations and burdens at slaughter, as well as excretion compartments 
(faeces and wool) collected during the depuration period. Decreases in empty 
body total and lipid weights were 6-fold higher in underfed and supplemented 
ewes compared to control ewes. In addition, over the depuration period 
undernutrition and supplementation treatment increased faecal TCDD, PCBs 126 and 
153 excretions by 1.4- to 2.1-fold but tended to decrease wool PCB 153 excretion 
by 1.4-fold. This induced 2- to 3-fold higher decreases in the empty body POPs 
burdens for underfed and supplemented ewes. Nonetheless, when expressed relative 
to the calculated initial empty body burdens, burdens at slaughter decreased 
only slightly from 97%, 103% and 98% for control ewes to 92%, 97% and 94% for 
underfed and supplemented ones, for TCDD, PCBs 126 and 153, respectively. Fine 
descriptions at once of POPs kinetic (companion paper 1) and mass balance 
(companion paper 2), and of body lipid dynamics were very useful in improving 
our understanding of the fate of POPs in the ruminants.
