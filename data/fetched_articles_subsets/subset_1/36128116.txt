BACKGROUND: Multiple primary malignancies (MPMs), especially coexistence of 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are rare. The most 
likely clinical diagnosis in patient with tumor in another organ is metastatic 
brain tumor. Although GBM is the most common brain tumor, it is rarely 
coexistent with other malignancies.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old female presented with headache and dizziness, 
along with abdominal pain for 2 weeks before being admitted. The abdominal 
computed tomography (CT) scan showed a kidney tumor. The patient developed left 
hemiplegia, and the brain CT scan showed an intracranial tumor. The patient 
suggested for radical nephrectomy and craniotomy tumor removal. Histopathology 
of the kidney and brain tumor revealed two different features, which showed RCC 
and GBM. Immunohistochemistry result confirmed the diagnosis of GBM and IDH1 
wild type; coexistent with clear cell RCC.
CONCLUSION: The coexistence of carcinoma and glioma should be regarded as 
coincidental cases if it did not accomplish the criteria for tumor-to-tumor 
metastasis or proven to be a genetic syndrome. This case report provides an 
addition to the literature about double primary malignancy in a single patient. 
More studies are needed to confirm whether they have causal relationship or 
merely coincidental findings.
