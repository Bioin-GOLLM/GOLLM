The MED13L-related intellectual disability or MRFACD syndrome (Mental 
retardation and distinctive facial features with or without cardiac defects; MIM 
# 616789) is one of the most common forms of syndromic intellectual disability 
with about a hundred cases reported so far. Affected individuals share 
overlapping features comprising intellectual disability, hypotonia, motor delay, 
remarkable speech delay, and a recognizable facial gestalt. De novo disruption 
of the MED13L gene by deletions, duplications, or sequence variants has been 
identified as deleterious. Siblings affected by intragenic deletion transmitted 
from a mosaic parent have been reported once in the literature. We now present 
the first case of paternal germinal mosaicism for a missense MED13L variant 
causing MRFACD syndrome in one of the father's children and being the likely 
cause of intellectual disability and facial dysmorphism in the other. As part of 
the Mediator complex, the MED proteins have an essential role in regulating 
transcription. Thirty-two subunits of the Mediator complex genes have been 
linked to congenital malformations that are now acknowledged as 
transcriptomopathies. The MRFACD syndrome has been suggested to represent a 
recognizable phenotype.
