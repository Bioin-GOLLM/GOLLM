BACKGROUND: Patients who have myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) 
display recurrent, albeit nonspecific cytogenetic abnormalities that are diverse 
prognostically. For the current study, the authors explored the relation between 
specific cytogenetic clones and JAK2(V617F) mutational status in patients with 
MMM and the effects on treatment response to erythropoietin (Epo).
METHODS: Concomitantly collected blood granulocytes and bone marrow were 
processed for JAK2(V617F) mutation analysis and cytogenetic studies, 
respectively. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and 
fluorescent dye chemistry sequencing was performed by using the same primers 
that were used for amplification.
RESULTS: Among 105 study patients, cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in 47 
patients (45%), and the JAK2(V617F) mutation was detected in 52 patients (50%). 
Comparison of mutational frequencies between favorable (normal, sole 13q-, or 
20q- clones; n = 70 patients) and unfavorable (all other abnormalities; n = 35 
patients) cytogenetic categories revealed a significantly different incidence of 
homozygous JAK2(V617F) between them (9% vs. 23%, respectively; P = .04). 
Furthermore, the mutant allele coexisted with several recurrent cytogenetic 
lesions. Among 25 patients who received Epo either alone (n = 17 patients) or in 
combination with hydroxyurea (n = 8 patients), 4 patients (16%) achieved a 
response, and none of them were homozygous for JAK2(V617F). Conversely, a 
response was more likely (P = .0001) in the presence of favorable cytogenetic 
abnormalities (i.e., 3 of 4 responders carried sole 13q- or 20q- clones).
CONCLUSIONS: Unfavorable and favorable cytogenetic clones in MMM clustered with 
homozygosity for JAK2(V617F) and treatment response to Epo-based therapy, 
respectively.
