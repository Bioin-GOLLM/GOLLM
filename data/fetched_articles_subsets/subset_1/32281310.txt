BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare group of disorders 
characterized by increased susceptibility to fractures due to genetically 
determined bone fragility. About 90% of cases are due to mutations in COL1A1 
(17q21.33) or COL1A2 (7q21.3) resulting in quantitative or qualitative defects 
in type I collagen, a key structural constituent of bone. OI due to complete 
COL1A1 deletion is rare.
METHODS: We present a case of OI type I in a Caucasian female referred at 
10 months of age for investigation of multiple fractures associated with minimal 
or no known trauma, small stature, and blue sclera. Her father has four to five 
lifetime fractures, blue sclera, normal stature, and a 14.5 kilobase (kb) 
deletion of COL1A1 detected by targeted array performed at an outside 
institution. Microarray comparative genomic hybridization was performed on the 
proband and all members of the family.
RESULTS: A previously unreported 235 kb deletion at 17q21.33 encompassing 
COL1A1, ITGA3, PDK2, SGCA, and HILS1 was detected in the proband. Also 
identified in both the proband and sibling is a maternally inherited 283 kb gain 
at 8p21.3 encompassing CSGALNACT1 and a 163 kb loss at 10q21.3 encompassing 
CTNNA3. Analysis in the father revealed the same size deletion at 17q21.33 as in 
the proband.
CONCLUSION: Together with previously reported cases of COL1A1 deletions, this 
case report emphasizes the importance of a whole-genome DNA copy number 
assessment in patients suspected for OI, which will elucidate the presence of 
precise COL1A1 deletions and any pathogenic secondary copy number variations.
