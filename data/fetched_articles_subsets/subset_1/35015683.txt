Downregulation of surface epitopes causes postimmunotherapy relapses in 
B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Here we demonstrate that mRNA encoding CD22 
undergoes aberrant splicing in B-ALL. We describe the plasma membrane-bound CD22 
Δex5-6 splice isoform, which is resistant to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T 
cells targeting the third immunoglobulin-like domain of CD22. We also describe 
splice variants skipping the AUG-containing exon 2 and failing to produce any 
identifiable protein, thereby defining an event that is rate limiting for 
epitope presentation. Indeed, forcing exon 2 skipping with morpholino 
oligonucleotides reduced CD22 protein expression and conferred resistance to the 
CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugate inotuzumab ozogamicin in vitro. 
Furthermore, among inotuzumab-treated pediatric patients with B-ALL, we 
identified one nonresponder in whose leukemic blasts Δex2 isoforms comprised the 
majority of CD22 transcripts. In a second patient, a sharp reduction in CD22 
protein levels during relapse was driven entirely by increased CD22 exon 2 
skipping. Thus, dysregulated CD22 splicing is a major mechanism of epitope 
downregulation and ensuing resistance to immunotherapy.
SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanism(s) underlying downregulation of surface CD22 
following CD22-directed immunotherapy remains underexplored. Our biochemical and 
correlative studies demonstrate that in B-ALL, CD22 expression levels are 
controlled by inclusion/skipping of CD22 exon 2. Thus, aberrant splicing of CD22 
is an important driver/biomarker of de novo and acquired resistance to 
CD22-directed immunotherapies. See related commentary by Bourcier and 
Abdel-Wahab, p. 87. This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 
85.
