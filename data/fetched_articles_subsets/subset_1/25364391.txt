The selective BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, yield high response 
rates and improved overall survival in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant 
metastatic melanoma. Acquired drug resistance and drug toxicity are key 
challenges when using these drugs. We investigated whether vemurafenib toxicity 
could successfully be managed with intermittent dosing, and if its therapeutic 
efficacy could be maintained on intermittent dosing. Six patients with BRAF 
V600E-mutated metastatic melanoma were treated with an intermittent dosing 
regimen of vemurafenib. In three patients, toxicities were successfully managed 
with an intermittent dosing regimen. In the other three patients, intolerable 
toxicities continued on intermittent dosing. Our experience shows that 
intermittent dosing can successfully manage vemurafenib toxicities where 
continuous dosing at a reduced dose does not. Intermittent treatment improves 
drug tolerability and can achieve or maintain melanoma shrinkage. We recommend 
that in clinical practice, intermittent dosing should be considered as an 
alternative to dose reduction/termination in the management of vemurafenib 
toxicity.
