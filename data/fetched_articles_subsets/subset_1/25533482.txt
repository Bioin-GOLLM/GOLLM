Abnormal NFκB activation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the signaling pathways governing NFκB regulation and function in the 
brain are poorly understood. We identify complement protein C3 as an astroglial 
target of NFκB and show that C3 release acts through neuronal C3aR to disrupt 
dendritic morphology and network function. Exposure to Aβ activates astroglial 
NFκB and C3 release, consistent with the high levels of C3 expression in brain 
tissue from AD patients and APP transgenic mice, where C3aR antagonist treatment 
rescues cognitive impairment. Therefore, dysregulation of neuron-glia 
interaction through NFκB/C3/C3aR signaling may contribute to synaptic 
dysfunction in AD, and C3aR antagonists may be therapeutically beneficial.
