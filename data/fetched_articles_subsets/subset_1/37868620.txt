Anthocyanins are essential for the quality of perennial horticultural crops, 
such as grapes. In grapes, ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and MYBA1 are two 
critical transcription factors that regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our 
previous work has shown that Vitis vinifera B-box protein 44 (VvBBX44) inhibits 
anthocyanin synthesis and represses VvHY5 expression in grape calli. However, 
the regulatory mechanism underlying this regulation was unclear. In this study, 
we found that loss of VvBBX44 function resulted in increased anthocyanin 
accumulation in grapevine callus. VvBBX44 directly represses VvMYBA1, which 
activates VvBBX44. VvMYBA1, but not VvBBX44, directly modulates the expression 
of grape UDP flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (VvUFGT). We demonstrated that 
VvBBX44 represses the transcriptional activation of VvUFGT and VvBBX44 induced 
by VvMYBA1. However, VvBBX44 and VvMYBA1 did not physically interact in yeast. 
The application of exogenous anthocyanin stimulated VvBBX44 expression in 
grapevine suspension cells and tobacco leaves. These findings suggest that 
VvBBX44 and VvMYBA1 form a transcriptional feedback loop to prevent 
overaccumulation of anthocyanin and reduce metabolic costs. Our work sheds light 
on the complex regulatory network that controls anthocyanin biosynthesis in 
grapevine.
