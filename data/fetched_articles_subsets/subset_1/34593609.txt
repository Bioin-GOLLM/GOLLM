Transglutaminase 2 (TG2) is a key epidermal squamous cell carcinoma cancer cell 
survival protein. However, how TG2 maintains the aggressive cancer phenotype is 
not well understood. The present studies show that TG2, which is highly 
expressed in epidermal cancer stem-like cells (ECS cells), maintains hepatocyte 
growth factor (HGF) signaling to drive an aggressive ECS cell cancer phenotype. 
Inhibiting TG2 reduces MET tyrosine kinase receptor expression and activity and 
attenuates the cancer cell phenotype. Moreover, inhibition of TG2 or HGF/MET 
function reduces downstream MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity, and this is associated 
with reduced cancer cell spheroid formation, invasion, and migration, and 
reduced stem and EMT marker expression. Treatment of TG2 knockdown cells with 
HGF partially restores the aggressive cancer phenotype, confirming that MET 
signaling is downstream of TG2. MET knockout reduces ERK1/2 signaling, doubles 
the time to initial tumor appearance, and reduces overall tumor growth. These 
findings suggest that TG2 maintains HGF/MET and MAPK (MEK1/2 and ERK1/2) 
signaling to drive the aggressive ECS cell cancer phenotype and tumor formation, 
and that TG2-dependent MET signaling may be a useful anti-cancer target. 
IMPLICATIONS: TG2 is an important epidermal squamous cell carcinoma stem cell 
survival protein. We show that TG2 activates an HGF/MET, MEK1/2 ERK1/2 signaling 
cascade that maintains the aggressive cancer phenotype.
