Although null mutations in Igalpha have been identified in patients with defects 
in B cell development, no mutations in Igbeta have been reported. We recently 
identified a patient with a homozygous amino acid substitution in Igbeta, a 
glycine to serine at codon 137, adjacent to the cysteine required for the 
disulfide bond between Igalpha and Igbeta. This patient has a small percentage 
of surface IgM(dim) B cells in the peripheral circulation (0.08% compared with 
5-20% in healthy controls). Using expression vectors in 293T cells or Jurkat T 
cells, we show that the mutant Igbeta can form disulfide-linked complexes and 
bring the mu H chain to the cell surface as part of the BCR but is inefficient 
at both tasks. The results show that minor changes in the ability of the 
Igalpha/Igbeta complex to bring the BCR to the cell surface have profound 
effects on B cell development.
