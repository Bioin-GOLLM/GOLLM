Jalili syndrome (JS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the 
combination of cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and amelogenesis imperfecta. To date, 18 
families with JS have been reported, 16 of which were found to have a mutation 
in CNNM4. We describe three siblings with clinical features of JS with a 
homozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of CNNM4, c.1781A>G (p.N594S). They 
demonstrated phenotypic variability in terms of ocular and dental findings. 
Although fundus examination and optical coherence tomography results were 
normal, the electroretinogram was compatible with CRD, supporting the diagnosis 
of JS. The dental phenotype severity also varied among the siblings.
