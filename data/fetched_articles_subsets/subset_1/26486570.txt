Thyroid nodules can be classified into benign and malignant tumors. However, 
distinguishing between these two types of tumors can be challenging in clinics. 
Since malignant nodules require surgical intervention whereas asymptomatic 
benign tumors do not, there is an urgent need for new techniques that enable 
accurate diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules. Here, we used (1)H NMR 
spectroscopy coupled with pattern recognition techniques to analyze the 
metabonomes of thyroid tissues and their extracts from thyroid lesion patients 
(n = 53) and their adjacent healthy thyroid tissues (n = 46). We also measured 
fatty acid compositions using GC-FID/MS techniques as complementary information. 
We demonstrate that thyroid lesion tissues can be clearly distinguishable from 
healthy tissues, and malignant tumors can also be distinguished from the benign 
tumors based on the metabolic profiles, both with high sensitivity and 
specificity. In addition, we show that thyroid lesions are accompanied with 
disturbances of multiple metabolic pathways, including alterations in energy 
metabolism (glycolysis, lipid and TCA cycle), promotions in protein turnover, 
nucleotide biosynthesis as well as phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. These 
findings provide essential information on the metabolic features of thyroid 
lesions and demonstrate that metabonomics technology can be potentially useful 
in the rapid and accurate preoperative diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules.
