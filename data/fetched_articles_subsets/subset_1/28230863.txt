Rab escort protein-1 (REP1) is linked to choroideremia (CHM), an X-linked 
degenerative disorder caused by mutations of the gene encoding REP1 (CHM). REP1 
mutant zebrafish showed excessive cell death throughout the body, including the 
eyes, indicating that REP1 is critical for cell survival, a hallmark of cancer. 
In the present study, we found that REP1 is overexpressed in human tumor tissues 
from cervical, lung, and colorectal cancer patients, whereas it is expressed at 
relatively low levels in the normal tissue counterparts. REP1 expression was 
also elevated in A549 lung cancer cells and HT-29 colon cancer cells compared 
with BEAS-2B normal lung and CCD-18Co normal colon epithelial cells, 
respectively. Interestingly, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated REP1 
knockdown-induced growth inhibition of cancer cell lines via downregulation of 
EGFR and inactivation of STAT3, but had a negligible effect on normal cell 
lines. Moreover, overexpression of REP1 in BEAS-2B cells enhanced cell growth 
and anchorage-independent colony formation with little increase in EGFR level 
and STAT3 activation. Furthermore, REP1 knockdown effectively reduced tumor 
growth in a mouse xenograft model via EGFR downregulation and STAT3 inactivation 
in vivo. These data suggest that REP1 plays an oncogenic role, driving 
tumorigenicity via EGFR and STAT3 signaling, and is a potential therapeutic 
target to control cancers.
