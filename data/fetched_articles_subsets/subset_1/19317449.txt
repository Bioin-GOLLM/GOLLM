To further investigate new potent and selective human A(1) adenosine receptor 
agonists, we have synthesized a series of 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy- and 
5'-(2-fluorophenylthio)-5'-deoxy-N(6)-cycloalkyl(bicycloalkyl)-substituted 
adenosine and 2'-C-methyladenosine derivatives. These compounds were evaluated 
for affinity and efficacy at human A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine 
receptors. In the series of N(6)-cyclopentyl- and 
N(6)-(endo-norborn-2-yl)adenosine derivatives, 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy-CPA (1) and 
5'-chloro-5'-deoxy-(+/-)-ENBA (3) displayed the highest affinity in the 
subnanomolar range and relevant selectivity for hA(1) vs the other human 
receptor subtypes. The higher affinity and selectivity of 
5'-chloro-5'-deoxyribonucleoside derivatives 1 and 3 for hA(1) AR vs hA(3) AR 
compared to that of the parent 5'-hydroxy compounds CPA and (+/-)-ENBA was 
rationalized by a molecular modeling analysis. 5'-Chloro-5'-deoxy-(+/-)-ENBA, 
evaluated for analgesic activity in the formalin test in mice, was found to 
inhibit the first or the second phases of the nocifensive response induced by 
intrapaw injection of formalin at doses ranging between 1 and 2 mg/kg i.p.
