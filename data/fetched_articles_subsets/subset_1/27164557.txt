It is well known that most schizophrenia patients smoke cigarettes. There are 
different hypotheses postulating the underlying mechanisms of this comorbidity. 
We used summary statistics from large meta-analyses of plasma cotinine 
concentration (COT), Fagerström test for nicotine dependence (FTND) and 
schizophrenia to examine the genetic relationship between these traits. We found 
that schizophrenia risk scores calculated at P-value thresholds of 5 × 10(-3) 
and larger predicted FTND and cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), suggesting that 
genes most significantly associated with schizophrenia were not associated with 
FTND/CPD, consistent with the self-medication hypothesis. The COT risk scores 
predicted schizophrenia diagnosis at P-values of 5 × 10(-3) and smaller, 
implying that genes most significantly associated with COT were associated with 
schizophrenia. These results implicated that schizophrenia and FTND/CPD/COT 
shared some genetic liability. Based on this shared liability, we identified 
multiple long non-coding RNAs and RNA binding protein genes (DA376252, BX089737, 
LOC101927273, LINC01029, LOC101928622, HY157071, DA902558, RBFOX1 and TINCR), 
protein modification genes (MANBA, UBE2D3, and RANGAP1) and energy production 
genes (XYLB, MTRF1 and ENOX1) that were associated with both conditions. Further 
analyses revealed that these shared genes were enriched in calcium signaling, 
long-term potentiation and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways that 
played a critical role in cognitive functions and neuronal plasticity.
