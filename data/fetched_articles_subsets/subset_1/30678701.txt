BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the genes ALOX5 (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase), 
ALOX5AP (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein) and LTA4H (leukotriene 
A4 hydrolase) has previously been shown to contribute to the risk of MI 
(myocardial infarction) in Caucasian and African American populations. All genes 
encode proteins playing a role in the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory 
leukotriene B mediators, possibly providing a link between MI and inflammation. 
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these associations could 
be confirmed in the study of China MI patients. The study included 401 Han 
Chinese MI patients and 409 controls. Six tag single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs)-ALOX5 rs12762303 and rs12264801, ALOX5AP rs10507391, LTA4H rs2072512, 
rs2540487 and rs2540477-were selected. SNP genotyping was performed by an 
improved multiplex ligation detection reaction assay.
RESULTS: The rs2540487 genotype was associated with the risk of MI in 
overdominant model (P = 0.008). rs12762303 and rs10507391 SNPs were 
significantly associated with lipid levels in MI patients (P < 0.006-0.008). 
Several SNPs interacted with alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and 
hypertension to modify TC, TG, LDL-C and CRE levels, and the risk of MI 
(P < 0.0017 for all). No association between the SNPs of LT pathway and 
susceptibility to MI was found (P > 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study provides additional evidence that 
functional genetic variation of the LT pathway can mediate atherogenic processes 
and the risk of MI in Chinese.
