Innate immune surveillance, which monitors the presence of potentially harmful 
microorganisms and the perturbations of host physiology that occur in response 
to infections, is critical to distinguish pathogens from beneficial microbes. 
Here, we show that multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP-1) functions 
in the basolateral membrane of intestinal cells to transport byproducts of 
cellular redox reactions to control both molecular and behavioral immunity in 
Caenorhabditis elegans. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection disrupts glutathione 
homeostasis, leading to the excess production of the MRP-1 substrate, oxidized 
glutathione (GSSG). Extracellular GSSG triggers pathogen avoidance behavior and 
primes naïve C. elegans to induce aversive learning behavior via neural NMDA 
class glutamate receptor-1 (NMR-1). Our results indicate that MRP-1 transports 
GSSG, which acts as a danger signal capable of warning C. elegans of changes in 
intestinal homeostasis, thereby initiating a gut neural signal that elicits an 
appropriate host defense response.
