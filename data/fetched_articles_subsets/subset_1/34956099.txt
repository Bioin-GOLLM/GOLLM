An increasing number of pollutants with endocrine disrupting potential are 
accumulating in the environment, increasing the exposure risk for humans. 
Several of them are known or suspected to interfere with endocrine signals, 
impairing reproductive functions. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a 
glycoprotein playing an essential role in supporting antral follicle maturation 
and may be a target of disrupting chemicals (EDs) likely impacting female 
fertility. EDs may interfere with FSH-mediated signals at different levels, 
since they may modulate the mRNA or protein levels of both the hormone and its 
receptor (FSHR), perturb the functioning of partner membrane molecules, modify 
intracellular signal transduction pathways and gene expression. In vitro studies 
and animal models provided results helpful to understand ED modes of action and 
suggest that they could effectively play a role as molecules interfering with 
the female reproductive system. However, most of these data are potentially 
subjected to experimental limitations and need to be confirmed by long-term 
observations in human.
