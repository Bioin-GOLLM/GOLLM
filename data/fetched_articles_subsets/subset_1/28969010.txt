Cancer cell metabolism is required to support the biosynthetic demands of cell 
growth and cell division, and to maintain reduction oxidaton (redox) 
homeostasis. This study was designed to test the effects of glucose and 
glutamine on ovarian cancer cell growth and explore the inter-relationship 
between glycolysis and glutaminolysis. The SKOV3, IGROV-1 and Hey ovarian cancer 
cell lines were assayed for glucose, pyruvate and glutamine dependence by 
analyzing cytotoxicity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and ATP production. As 
determined by MTT assay, glucose stimulated cell growth while the combination of 
glucose, glutamine and pyruvate resulted in the greatest stimulation of cell 
proliferation. Furthermore, 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) and 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) 
induced apoptosis, caused G1 phase cell cycle arrest and reduced glycolytic 
activity. Moreover, 2-DG in combination with a low dose of aminooxyacetate (AOA) 
synergistically increased the sensitivity to 2-DG in the inhibition of cell 
growth in the ovarian cancer cell lines. These studies suggest that dual 
inhibition of glycolysis and glutaminolysis may be a promising therapeutic 
strategy for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
