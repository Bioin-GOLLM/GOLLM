BACKGROUND: A high percentage of patients with thin melanoma (TM), defined as 
lesions with Breslow thickness ≤1 mm, presents excellent long-term survival, 
however, some patients develop metastases. Existing prognostic factors cannot 
reliably differentiate TM patients at risk for metastases.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed at characterizing the clinical-pathologic and mutation 
profile of metastatic and not-metastatic TM in order to distinguish lesions at 
risk of metastases.
METHODS: Clinical-pathologic characteristics were recorded for the TM cases 
analyzed. We used a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) multi-gene panel to 
characterize TM for multiple somatic mutations.
RESULTS: A statistically significant association emerged between the presence of 
metastases and Breslow thickness ≥0.6 mm (p=0.003). None of TM with lymph-node 
involvement had Breslow thickness <0.6 mm. Somatic mutations were identified in 
19 of 21 TM analyzed (90.5%). No mutations were observed in two not-metastatic 
cases with the lowest Breslow thickness (≤0.4 mm), whereas mutations in more 
than one gene were detected in one metastatic case with the highest Breslow 
thickness (1.00 mm).
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates Breslow thickness ≥0.6 mm as a valid prognostic 
factor to distinguish TM at risk for metastases.
