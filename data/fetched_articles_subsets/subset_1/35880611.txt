Bacterial pathogens have a critical impact on aquaculture, a sector that 
accounts for half of the human fish consumption. Flavobacterium psychrophilum 
(phylum Bacteroidetes) is responsible for bacterial cold-water disease in 
salmonids worldwide. The molecular factors involved in host invasion, 
colonization and haemorrhagic septicaemia are mostly unknown. In this study, we 
identified two new TonB-dependent receptors, HfpR and BfpR, that are required 
for adaptation to iron conditions encountered during infection and for virulence 
in rainbow trout. Transcriptional analyses revealed that their expression is 
tightly controlled and upregulated under specific iron sources and 
concentrations. Characterization of deletion mutants showed that they act 
without redundancy: BfpR is required for optimal growth in the presence of high 
haemoglobin level, while HfpR confers the capacity to acquire nutrient iron from 
haem or haemoglobin under iron scarcity. The gene hfpY, co-transcribed with 
hfpR, encodes a protein related to the HmuY family. We demonstrated that HfpY 
binds haem and contributes significantly to host colonization and disease 
severity. Overall, these results are consistent with a model in which both BfpR 
and Hfp systems promote haem uptake and respond to distinct signals to adapt 
iron acquisition to the different stages of pathogenesis. Our findings give 
insight into the molecular basis of pathogenicity of a serious pathogen 
belonging to the understudied family Flavobacteriaceae and point to the newly 
identified haem receptors as promising targets for antibacterial development.
