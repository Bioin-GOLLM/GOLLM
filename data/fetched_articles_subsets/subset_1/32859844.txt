Cutis laxa is a set of genetically heterogeneous conditions with phenotypes 
ranging from progeria-like appearance, corneal clouding, clenched fingers with 
marked retardation of growth both pre and postnatal growth to very mild 
phenotypes with skin laxity becoming evident in 2nd or 3rd decade. A child who 
presents with predominant motor delay is written off with a clinical diagnosis 
of rickets in the absence of any clinical sign of lax skin. Here, we report a 
2-year-old child who presented with motor delay and joint hyperlaxity. Mutation 
analysis demonstrated a heterozygous mutationc.G1867A in the exon 15 of ALDH18A1 
gene known to cause autosomal dominant cutis laxa.
