BACKGROUND: Fixed-dose combinations of artemisinin combination therapy are 
strongly recommended to facilitate drug administration and compliance. New 
fixed-dose combinations must nevertheless be evaluated in relevant populations 
in terms of efficacy and pharmacokinetics.
METHODS: A single-arm, open-label, clinical trial was performed in Indian 
patients with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria to investigate 
the efficacy and the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine when combined with 
artesunate in a fixed-dose combination (400/200 mg of mefloquine 
base/artesunate). The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using a population 
approach.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included in the study. Mefloquine 
pharmacokinetics obeys a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination. Mean parameter estimates (% inter-individual variability) were as 
follows: 0.16 h(-1) (75%) for the absorption rate constant, 1.13 L/h (30%) for 
the apparent plasma clearance, 271 L (21%) for the apparent central distribution 
volume, 344 L (54%) for the apparent peripheral distribution volume, and 1.43 
L/h for the apparent distribution clearance. These values were consistent with 
the pharmacokinetic results described in Thai patients. No significant covariate 
was found for clearance. Body weight explained the inter-individual variability 
of the apparent central and peripheral distribution volumes. The PCR-adjusted 
efficacy of the treatment was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant covariate explaining the inter-individual 
variability of mefloquine clearance, combined with the excellent efficacy, 
supports the use of the standard 200/400 mg of artesunate-mefloquine fixed-dose 
combination in Indian patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
