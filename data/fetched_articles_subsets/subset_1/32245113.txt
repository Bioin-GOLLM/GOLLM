Variants in LMNA, encoding A-type lamins, are responsible for laminopathies 
including muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, and progeroid syndromes. 
Cardiovascular laminopathic involvement is classically described as 
cardiomyopathy in striated muscle laminopathies, and arterial wall dysfunction 
and/or valvulopathy in lipodystrophic and/or progeroid laminopathies. We report 
unexpected cardiovascular phenotypes in patients with LMNA-associated 
lipodystrophies, illustrating the complex multitissular pathophysiology of the 
disease and the need for specific cardiovascular investigations in affected 
patients. A 33-year-old woman was diagnosed with generalized lipodystrophy and 
atypical progeroid syndrome due to the newly identified heterozygous LMNA 
p.(Asp136Val) variant. Her complex cardiovascular phenotype was associated with 
atherosclerosis, aortic valvular disease and left ventricular hypertrophy with 
rhythm and conduction defects. A 29-year-old woman presented with a partial 
lipodystrophy syndrome and a severe coronary atherosclerosis which required a 
triple coronary artery bypass grafting. She carried the novel heterozygous 
p.(Arg60Pro) LMNA variant inherited from her mother, affected with partial 
lipodystrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Different lipodystrophy-associated 
LMNA pathogenic variants could target cardiac vasculature and/or muscle, leading 
to complex overlapping phenotypes. Unifying pathophysiological hypotheses should 
be explored in several cell models including adipocytes, cardiomyocytes and 
vascular cells. Patients with LMNA-associated lipodystrophy should be 
systematically investigated with 24-h ECG monitoring, echocardiography and 
non-invasive coronary function testing.
