Pf prophages are ssDNA filamentous prophages that are prevalent among various 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The genomes of Pf prophages contain not only 
core genes encoding functions involved in phage replication, structure and 
assembly but also accessory genes. By studying the accessory genes in the Pf4 
prophage in P. aeruginosa PAO1, we provided experimental evidence to demonstrate 
that PA0729 and the upstream ORF Rorf0727 near the right attachment site of Pf4 
form a type II toxin/antitoxin (TA) pair. Importantly, we found that the 
deletion of the toxin gene PA0729 greatly increased Pf4 phage production. We 
thus suggest the toxin PA0729 be named PfiT for Pf4 inhibition toxin and 
Rorf0727 be named PfiA for PfiT antitoxin. The PfiT toxin directly binds to PfiA 
and functions as a corepressor of PfiA for the TA operon. The PfiAT complex 
exhibited autoregulation by binding to a palindrome (5'-AATTCN5 GTTAA-3') 
overlapping the -35 region of the TA operon. The deletion of pfiT disrupted TA 
autoregulation and activated pfiA expression. Additionally, the deletion of pfiT 
also activated the expression of the replication initiation factor gene PA0727. 
Moreover, the Pf4 phage released from the pfiT deletion mutant overcame the 
immunity provided by the phage repressor Pf4r. Therefore, this study reveals 
that the TA systems in Pf prophages can regulate phage production and phage 
immunity, providing new insights into the function of TAs in mobile genetic 
elements.
