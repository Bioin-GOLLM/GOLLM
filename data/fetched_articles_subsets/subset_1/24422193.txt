BACKGROUND: Bacteria of the Mycobacterium abscessus group are the second most 
common pathogens responsible for lung disease caused by nontuberculous 
mycobacteria in Korea. There is still a lack of studies investigating the 
genetic mechanisms involved in M. abscessus resistance to antibiotics other than 
clarithromycin. This study investigated the characteristics of drug resistance 
exhibited by M. abscessus clinical isolates from Korea.
METHODS: We performed drug susceptibility testing for a total of 404 M. 
abscessus clinical strains. Subspecies were differentiated by molecular 
biological methods and examined for mutations in drug resistance-related genes.
RESULTS: Of the 404 strains examined, 202 (50.00%), 199 (49.26%), and 3 (0.74%) 
strains were identified as M. abscessus, M. massiliense, and M. bolletii, 
respectively. Of the 152 clarithromycin-resistant strains, 6 possessed rrl 
mutations, while 4 of the 30 amikacin-resistant strains contained rrs mutations, 
and 5 of the 114 quinolone-resistant strains had gyr mutations. All mutant 
strains had high minimal inhibitory concentration values for the antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed the distribution of the strains with mutations 
in drug resistance-related genes was low in the M. abscessus group. Furthermore, 
we performed drug susceptibility testing and sequence analyses to determine the 
characteristics of these genes in the M. abscessus group.
