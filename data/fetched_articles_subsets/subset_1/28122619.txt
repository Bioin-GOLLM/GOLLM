OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship among body mass index (BMI), 
cardiometabolic risk and coronary artery disease (CAD) among patients undergoing 
coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA).
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 1118 patients, who underwent coronary CTA 
at two centers from September 2004 to October 2011. Coronary CTA were 
categorized as normal, nonobstructive CAD (<50%), or obstructive CAD (≥50%) in 
addition to segment involvement (SIS) and stenosis scores. Extensive CAD was 
defined as SIS > 4. Association of BMI with cardiovascular prognosis was 
evaluated using multivariable fractional polynomial models.
RESULTS: Mean age of the cohort was 57 ± 13 years with median follow-up of 
3.2 years. Increasing BMI was associated with MetS (OR 1.28 per 1 kg/m2, 
p < 0.001) and burden of CAD on a univariable basis, but not after multivariable 
adjustment. Prognosis demonstrated a J-shaped relationship with BMI. For BMI 
from 20-39.9 kg/m2, after adjustment for age, gender, and smoking, MetS (HR 
2.23, p = 0.009) was more strongly associated with adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to normal BMI, there was an increased burden of CAD for 
BMI > 25 kg/m2. Within each BMI category, metabolically unhealthy patients had 
greater extent of CAD, as measured by CCTA, compared to metabolically healthy 
patients.
