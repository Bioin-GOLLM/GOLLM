We report an African American family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in which 
an individual with severe disease has alterations in two sarcomeric protein 
genes, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and troponin I (TNNI3). Each of 
her children has only one of these mutations. Although novel, the MYH7 mutation 
disrupts a conserved amino acid, and other missense substitutions at this 
position are known to cause disease. The TNNI3 alteration, replacing proline 
with serine (Pro82Ser), has been previously implicated in elderly-onset 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, although its pathogenicity is not clear. Proline in 
this position is conserved in all species, and its alteration to a serine is 
likely to result in a dramatic change in protein structure. We analyzed DNA from 
a panel of 100 healthy African Americans and found 3% carry the heterozygous 
TNNI3 missense allele that was identified in this family. Based on these 
findings, we propose that the TNNI3 Pro82Ser alteration is likely a 
disease-modifying mutation in a severely affected individual, and, furthermore, 
carriers of this alteration (3% of African Americans) might be at increased risk 
of late-onset cardiac hypertrophy.
