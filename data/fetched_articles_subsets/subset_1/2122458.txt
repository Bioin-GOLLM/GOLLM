Affected members of most kindreds with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy have a 
partial deficiency of functional Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that 
stimulates adenylyl cyclase. By use of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify 
genomic fragments with the attachment of a high-melting G + C-rich region (GC 
clamp) and analysis of these fragments by denaturing gradient gel 
electrophoresis, heterozygous mutations in the Gs alpha-subunit gene were found 
in two kindreds. These included a G----C substitution at the donor splice 
junction of intron 10 and a coding frameshift created by a single base deletion 
within exon 10. The findings illustrate the heterogeneity of genetic defects in 
Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and the usefulness of the polymerase chain 
reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method to search rapidly for 
mutations in a large candidate gene.
