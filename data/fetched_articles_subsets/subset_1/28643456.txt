BACKGROUND: Mutations in IRF6, CHUK (IKKA), and RIPK4 can lead to a disease 
spectrum that includes cutaneous, limb, and craniofacial malformations. Loss of 
these alleles in the mouse leads to perinatal lethality and severe cutaneous, 
limb, and craniofacial defects also. Genetic rescue in the mouse has been shown 
for Ikka and Ripk4.
RESULTS: Here, we show partial genetic rescue of Irf6 knockout embryos using the 
KRT14 promoter to drive Irf6 expression in the basal epithelium. In contrast to 
Irf6 knockout embryos, rescue embryos survive the immediate perinatal period. 
Macroscopic examination reveals rescue of skin adhesions between the axial and 
appendicular skeleton. Unexpectedly, KRT14-driven Irf6 expression does not 
completely rescue orofacial clefting and adhesions between the palate and 
tongue, suggesting the importance of cell-autonomous IRF6 expression in 
periderm. Like knockout embryos, Irf6 rescue embryos also have persistent 
esophageal adhesions, which likely contribute to postnatal demise.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that targeted expression of IRF6 can 
significantly reduce disease severity, but that a minimum level of Irf6 in both 
periderm and basal epithelial cells is necessary for orofacial development. 
Therefore, homologous human and mouse phenotypes are observed for IRF6, IKKA, 
and RIPK4. In this work, we show that altering the expression level of IRF6 
dramatically modified this phenotype in utero. Developmental Dynamics
