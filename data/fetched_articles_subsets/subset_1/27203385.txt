Surface CD24 has previously been described, together with CD44 and ESA, for the 
characterization of putative cancer stem cells in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most fatal of all solid tumors. CD24 has a variety of 
biological functions including the regulation of invasiveness and cell 
proliferation, depending on the tumor entity and subcellular localization. 
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) expressing oncogenic KrasG12D 
recapitulate the human disease and develop PDAC. In this study we investigate 
the function of CD24 using GEMM of endogenous PDAC and a model of 
cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. We found that (i) CD24 expression was 
upregulated in murine and human PDAC and during acute pancreatitis (ii) CD24 was 
expressed exclusively in differentiated PDAC, whereas CD24 absence was 
associated with undifferentiated tumors and (iii) membranous CD24 expression 
determines tumor subpopulations with an epithelial phenotype in grafted models. 
In addition, we show that CD24 protein is stabilized in response to WNT 
activation and that overexpression of CD24 in pancreatic cancer cells 
upregulated β-catenin expression augmenting an epithelial, non-metastatic 
signature. Our results support a positive feedback model according to which (i) 
WNT activation and subsequent β-catenin dephosphorylation stabilize CD24 protein 
expression, and (ii) sustained CD24 expression upregulates β-catenin expression. 
Eventually, membranous CD24 augments the epithelial phenotype of pancreatic 
tumors. Thus we link the WNT/β-catenin pathway with the regulation of CD24 in 
the context of PDAC differentiation.
