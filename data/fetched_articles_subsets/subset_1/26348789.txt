Withstanding 3.5 billion years of genetic drift, the canonical genetic code 
remains such a fundamental foundation for the complexity of life that it is 
highly conserved across all three phylogenetic domains. Genome engineering 
technologies are now making it possible to rationally change the genetic code, 
offering resistance to viruses, genetic isolation from horizontal gene transfer, 
and prevention of environmental escape by genetically modified organisms. We 
discuss the biochemical, genetic, and technological challenges that must be 
overcome in order to engineer the genetic code.
