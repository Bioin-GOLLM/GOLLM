BACKGROUND: Familial combined hypolipidemia, a Mendelian condition characterized 
by substantial reductions in all 3 major lipid fractions, is caused by mutations 
that inactivate the gene angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3). Whether ANGPTL3 
deficiency reduces risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The study goal was to leverage 3 distinct lines of evidence-a family 
that included individuals with complete (compound heterozygote) ANGPTL3 
deficiency, a population based-study of humans with partial (heterozygote) 
ANGPTL3 deficiency, and biomarker levels in patients with myocardial infarction 
(MI)-to test whether ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with lower risk for CAD.
METHODS: We assessed coronary atherosclerotic burden in 3 individuals with 
complete ANGPTL3 deficiency and 3 wild-type first-degree relatives using 
computed tomography angiography. In the population, ANGPTL3 loss-of-function 
(LOF) mutations were ascertained in up to 21,980 people with CAD and 158,200 
control subjects. LOF mutations were defined as nonsense, frameshift, and 
splice-site variants, along with missense variants resulting in <25% of 
wild-type ANGPTL3 activity in a mouse model. In a biomarker study, circulating 
ANGPTL3 concentration was measured in 1,493 people who presented with MI and 
3,232 control subjects.
RESULTS: The 3 individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency showed no evidence 
of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. ANGPTL3 gene sequencing demonstrated that 
approximately 1 in 309 people was a heterozygous carrier for an LOF mutation. 
Compared with those without mutation, heterozygous carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF 
mutations demonstrated a 17% reduction in circulating triglycerides and a 12% 
reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Carrier status was associated 
with a 34% reduction in odds of CAD (odds ratio: 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 
0.44 to 0.98; p = 0.04). Individuals in the lowest tertile of circulating 
ANGPTL3 concentrations, compared with the highest, had reduced odds of MI 
(adjusted odds ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.55 to 0.77; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with protection from CAD.
