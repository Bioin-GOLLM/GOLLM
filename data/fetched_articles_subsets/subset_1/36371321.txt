BACKGROUND: Exploiting cancer metabolism during nutrient availability holds 
immense potential for the clinical and therapeutic benefits of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) patients. Dietary methionine is a metabolic dependence of cancer 
development, but how the signal transduction integrates methionine status to 
achieve the physiological demand of cancer cells remains unknown.
METHODS: Low or high levels of dietary methionine was fed to mouse models with 
patient-derived xenograft or diethyl-nitrosamine induced liver cancer. RNA 
sequence and metabolomics were performed to reveal the profound effect of 
methionine restriction on gene expression and metabolite changes. 
Immunostaining, sphere formation assays, in vivo tumourigenicity, migration and 
self-renewal ability were conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of methionine 
restriction and sorafenib.
RESULTS: We discovered that mTORC1-c-Myc-SIRT4 axis was abnormally regulated in 
a methionine-dependent manner and affected the HCC progression. c-Myc rewires 
methionine metabolism through TRIM32 mediated degradation of SIRT4, which 
regulates MAT2A activity by ADP-ribosylation on amino acid residue glutamic acid 
111. MAT2A is a key enzyme to generate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Loss of SIRT4 
activates MAT2A, thereby increasing SAM level and dynamically regulating gene 
expression, which triggers the high proliferation rate of tumour cells. SIRT4 
exerts its tumour suppressive function with targeted therapy (sorafenib) by 
affecting methionine, redox and nucleotide metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a novel characterization of the signaling 
transduction and the metabolic consequences of dietary methionine restriction in 
malignant liver tissue of mice. mTORC1, c-Myc, SIRT4 and ADP ribosylation site 
of MAT2A are promising clinical and therapeutic targets for the HCC treatment.
