Ran, a small guanosine triphosphatase, is suggested to have additional functions 
beyond its well-characterized role in nuclear trafficking. Guanosine 
triphosphate-bound Ran, but not guanosine diphosphate-bound Ran, stimulated 
polymerization of astral microtubules from centrosomes assembled on Xenopus 
sperm. Moreover, a Ran allele with a mutation in the effector domain (RanL43E) 
induced the formation of microtubule asters and spindle assembly, in the absence 
of sperm nuclei, in a gammaTuRC (gamma-tubulin ring complex)- and XMAP215 
(Xenopus microtubule associated protein)-dependent manner. Therefore, Ran could 
be a key signaling molecule regulating microtubule polymerization during 
mitosis.
