The title compound, [Os3(C6H12N3P)4(CO)8], crystallizes in the ortho-rhom-bic 
space group Pbca with Z = 8. The mol-ecule consists of a triangular triosmium(0) 
core surrounded by eight carbonyl ligands and four 
1,3,5-tri-aza-7-phosphatri-cyclo-[3.3.1.13,7]decane (or PTA) ligands. One Os 
atom is coordinated by two PTA ligands and two CO ligands, while the other two 
Os atoms are each bonded to a single PTA ligand and three CO ligands. There is a 
small disorder associated with the Os3 unit so that a minor orientation has an 
occupancy of 2.17 (4)%. The title compound represents the first structurally 
characterized triangular Os3 carbonyl cluster with four monodentate tertiary 
phosphane ligands.
