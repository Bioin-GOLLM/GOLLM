A small library of truncated/lipid-conjugated neuromedin U (NmU) analogs was 
synthesized and tested in vitro using an intracellular calcium signaling assay. 
The selected, most active analogs were then tested in vivo, and showed potent 
anorexigenic effects in a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model. The most 
promising compound, NM4-C16 was effective in a once-weekly-dose regimen. 
Collectively, our findings suggest that short, lipidated analogs of NmU are 
suitable leads for the development of novel anti-obesity therapeutics.
