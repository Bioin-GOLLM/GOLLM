Sigma 1 Receptor (S1R) is a therapeutic target for a wide spectrum of 
pathological conditions ranging from neurodegenerative diseases to cancer and 
COVID-19. S1R is ubiquitously expressed throughout the visceral organs, nervous, 
immune and cardiovascular systems. It is proposed to function as a 
ligand-dependent molecular chaperone that modulates multiple intracellular 
signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to define the S1R proximatome 
under native conditions and upon binding to well-characterized ligands. This was 
accomplished by fusing the biotin ligase, Apex2, to the C terminus of S1R. Cells 
stably expressing S1R-Apex or a GFP-Apex control were used to map proximal 
proteins. Biotinylated proteins were labeled under native conditions and in a 
ligand dependent manner, then purified and identified using quantitative mass 
spectrometry. Under native conditions, S1R biotinylates over 200 novel proteins, 
many of which localize within the endomembrane system (endoplasmic reticulum, 
Golgi, secretory vesicles) and function within the secretory pathway. Under 
conditions of cellular exposure to either S1R agonist or antagonist, results 
show enrichment of proteins integral to secretion, extracellular matrix 
formation, and cholesterol biosynthesis. Notably, Proprotein Convertase 
Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) displays increased binding to S1R under 
conditions of treatment with Haloperidol, a well-known S1R antagonist; whereas 
Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) binds more efficiently to S1R upon 
treatment with (+)-Pentazocine ((+)-PTZ), a classical S1R agonist. Furthermore, 
we demonstrate that the ligand bound state of S1R correlates with specific 
changes to the cellular secretome. Our results are consistent with the 
postulated role of S1R as an intracellular chaperone and further suggest 
important and novel functionalities related to secretion and cholesterol 
metabolism.
