The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in humans is 
associated with brain differences including decreased number of activated 
microglia. In animals, NSAIDs are associated with reduced microglia, decreased 
amyloid burden, and neuronal preservation. Several studies suggest NSAIDs 
protect brain regions affected in the earliest stages of AD, including 
hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. In this cross-sectional study, we 
examined the protective effect of NSAID use on gray matter volume in a group of 
middle-aged and older NSAID users (n = 25) compared to non-user controls 
(n = 50). All participants underwent neuropsychological testing and T1-weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging. Non-user controls showed smaller volume in portions 
of the left hippocampus compared to NSAID users. Age-related loss of volume 
differed between groups, with controls showing greater medial temporal lobe 
volume loss with age compared to NSAID users. These results should be considered 
preliminary, but support previous reports that NSAIDs may modulate age-related 
loss of brain volume.
