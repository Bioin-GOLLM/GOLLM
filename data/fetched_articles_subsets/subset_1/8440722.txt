3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase (HL) catalyzes the final step of 
ketogenesis, an important pathway of mammalian energy metabolism. HL deficiency 
is an autosomal recessive inborn error in man leading to episodes of 
hypoglycemia and coma. Using the N-terminal peptide sequence of purified chicken 
liver HL, we designed degenerate sequence primers and amplified an 89-base pair 
(bp) chicken liver HL cDNA fragment. Longer cDNA clones for chicken (1384 bp) 
and human (1575 bp) HL were obtained by library screening. The peptide sequence 
predicted from the chicken clone contains two peptides from purified chicken HL. 
Mature human and chicken HL are 298-residue peptides. The sequence of the human 
clone predicts a 27-residue mitochondrial leader and a 31.6-kDa mature HL 
peptide. Human fibroblast and liver RNA contain a single 1.7-kilobase HL 
message. Two Acadian French-Canadian siblings with HL deficiency were homozygous 
for a 2-base pair deletion within the Ser-69 codon (S69fs(-2)), predicted to 
result in a truncated nonfunctional HL peptide lacking a complete active site. 
S69fs(-2) was not present in 12 other HL-deficient patients of 10 other ethnic 
origins, showing that HL deficiency is genetically heterogeneous.
