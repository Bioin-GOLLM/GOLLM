Rhizocticins are phosphono-oligopeptide antibiotics that contain a toxic 
C-terminal ( Z) -l -2-amino-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (APPA) moiety. APPA is 
an irreversible inhibitor of threonine synthase (ThrC), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate 
(PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of O-phospho-l-homoserine 
to l-threonine. ThrCs are essential for the viability of bacteria, plants, and 
fungi and are a target for antibiotic development, as de novo threonine 
biosynthetic pathway is not found in humans. Given the ability of APPA to 
interfere in threonine metabolism, it is unclear how the producing strain B. 
subtilis ATCC 6633 circumvents APPA toxicity. Notably, in addition to the 
housekeeping APPA-sensitive ThrC ( BsThrC), B. subtilis encodes a second 
threonine synthase (RhiB) encoded within the rhizocticin biosynthetic gene 
cluster. Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses show that PLP-dependent RhiB is an 
authentic threonine synthase, converting O-phospho-l-homoserine to threonine 
with a catalytic efficiency comparable to BsThrC. To understand the structural 
basis of inhibition, we determined the crystal structure of APPA bound to the 
housekeeping BsThrC, revealing a covalent complex between the inhibitor and PLP. 
Structure-based sequence analyses reveal structural determinants within the RhiB 
active site that contribute to rendering this ThrC homologue resistant to APPA. 
Together, this work establishes the self-resistance mechanism utilized by B. 
subtilis ATCC 6633 against APPA exemplifying one of many ways by which bacteria 
can overcome phosphonate toxicity.
