AIMS: This study examines the effect of a change from the standard 4-5 hours 3 
times a week of online hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) to 2-2.5 hours daily (6 times 
a week) OL-HDF, on acid-base balance, and attempts assess the modifications of 
acid-base parameters, ionic concentration, and electrical charges of albumin and 
phosphate available for diffusion and convection mechanisms across the membrane 
and subsequent infusion.
METHODS: In 18 patients on online HDF, blood gas, electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), 
lactate, phosphate, albumin, apparent strong ion difference (SIDa), effective 
strong ion difference (SIDe), strong ion gap (SIG), anion gap (AG), and 
bicarbonate and pH time-averaged concentration (TAC) and time-averaged deviation 
(TAD) variables were evaluated at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after 
patients were switched to daily OL-HDF. Additionally, in 12 patients, the same 
parameters measured simultaneously at dialyzer inlet, outlet, and after 
reinfusion were studied.
RESULTS: Throughout the study, weekly single-pool Kt/V, equilibrated Kt/V, and 
TAC urea remained constant. However, standard Kt/V increased and TAD urea 
decreased on daily OL-HDF. There were no statistical differences during the time 
span of 12 months in pH, cations (Na, K), anions (Cl, HCO3(-) AG, and lactate), 
or SIDa, SIDe, and SIG pre-HDF; while pH and HCO3(-) TAD decreased from 0.02 and 
1.02 +/- 0.74 mEq/L, to 0.01 and 0.64 +/- 0.52 mEq/L, respectively (p<0.01). Net 
albumin charge and AG increased significantly at dialyzer outlet and decreased 
after reinfusion.
CONCLUSIONS: We did not observe changes in the acid-base balance in patients who 
switched from 3 times a week to short daily OL-HDF. The main benefit observed 
was a lower pH and bicarbonate TAD. This shows a better physiology for daily 
OL-HDF.
