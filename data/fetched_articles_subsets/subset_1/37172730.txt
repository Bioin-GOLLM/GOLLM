Here, we report a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay as a 
novel way to investigate the binding of unlabeled ligands to the human transient 
receptor potential mucolipin 1 (hTRPML1), a lysosomal ion channel involved in 
several genetic diseases and cancer progression. This novel BRET assay can be 
used to determine equilibrium and kinetic binding parameters of unlabeled 
compounds to hTRPML1 using intact human-derived cells, thus complementing the 
information obtained using functional assays based on ion channel activation. We 
expect this new BRET assay to expedite the identification and optimization of 
cell-permeable ligands that interact with hTRPML1 within the physiologically 
relevant environment of lysosomes.
