Adoptive cell therapy with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represents an 
effective treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. However, most of the 
Ag targets recognized by effective melanoma-reactive TILs remain elusive. In 
this study, patient 2369 experienced a complete response, including regressions 
of bulky liver tumor masses, ongoing beyond 7 y following adoptive TIL transfer. 
The screening of a cDNA library generated from the autologous melanoma cell line 
resulted in the isolation of a mutated protein phosphatase 1, regulatory 
(inhibitor) subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) gene product. The mutated PPP1R3B peptide 
represents the immunodominant epitope recognized by tumor-reactive T cells in 
TIL 2369. Five years following adoptive transfer, peripheral blood T lymphocytes 
obtained from patient 2369 recognized the mutated PPP1R3B epitope. These results 
demonstrate that adoptive T cell therapy targeting a tumor-specific Ag can 
mediate long-term survival for a patient with metastatic melanoma. This study 
also provides an impetus to develop personalized immunotherapy targeting 
tumor-specific, mutated Ags.
