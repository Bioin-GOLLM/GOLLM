CONTEXT: Acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) is a low molecular weight tyrosine 
phosphatase that has been shown to be an important regulator of insulin receptor 
signaling.
OBJECTIVE: We tested whether variation in ACP1 is associated with type 2 
diabetes-related traits in 1035 individuals in 339 Mexican-American families of 
probands with or without a previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM).
DESIGN: Study participants were phenotyped by oral glucose tolerance test (for 
glucose and insulin level) and iv glucose tolerance test (for insulin 
sensitivity and acute insulin response) and had dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
scans to assess body composition. Six tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
were identified from among 15 SNPs genotyped across the ACP1 region. SNPs were 
tested for association with phenotypes using a likelihood ratio test under a 
variance components framework.
RESULTS: After Bonferroni correction, none of the SNPs were associated with type 
2 diabetes mellitus-related phenotypes. However, we observed a significant 
sex-specific effect of rs3828329. Among males, rs3828329 was significantly 
associated with fasting insulin (Bonferroni P = 0.007) and insulin sensitivity 
(Bonferroni P = 0.019) and marginally associated with 2-h insulin (Bonferroni P 
= 0.058) and percentage body fat (Bonferroni P = 0.09).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant associations in females. We conclude that 
variation in ACP1 is associated with fasting insulin and insulin sensitivity in 
a sex-specific manner.
