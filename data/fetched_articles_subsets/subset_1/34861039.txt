SF3B1 splicing factor mutations are near-universally found in myelodysplastic 
syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS), a clonal hematopoietic disorder 
characterized by abnormal erythroid cells with iron-loaded mitochondria. Despite 
this remarkably strong genotype-to-phenotype correlation, the mechanism by which 
mutant SF3B1 dysregulates iron metabolism to cause RS remains unclear due to an 
absence of physiological models of RS formation. Here, we report an induced 
pluripotent stem cell model of SF3B1-mutant MDS that for the first time 
recapitulates robust RS formation during in vitro erythroid differentiation. 
Mutant SF3B1 induces missplicing of ∼100 genes throughout erythroid 
differentiation, including proposed RS driver genes TMEM14C, PPOX, and ABCB7. 
All 3 missplicing events reduce protein expression, notably occurring via 5' UTR 
alteration, and reduced translation efficiency for TMEM14C. Functional rescue of 
TMEM14C and ABCB7, but not the non-rate-limiting enzyme PPOX, markedly decreased 
RS, and their combined rescue nearly abolished RS formation. Our study 
demonstrates that coordinated missplicing of mitochondrial transporters TMEM14C 
and ABCB7 by mutant SF3B1 sequesters iron in mitochondria, causing RS formation.
