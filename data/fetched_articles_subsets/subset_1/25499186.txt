Antimicrobial resistance in Helicobacter pylori has increased worldwide and has 
become a major cause of treatment failure in many countries, including Vietnam. 
It is advisable to perform an antibiogram to provide optimal regimens for H. 
pylori eradication. This study evaluated the rate of antibiotic resistance to 
the four commonly used antibiotics against H. pylori at a tertiary care hospital 
in Central Vietnam and analysed point mutations in genes related to 
clarithromycin (CLA) and levofloxacin (LFX) resistance. A total of 92 H. pylori 
strains from gastric biopsy specimens were tested; 42.4% were resistant to CLA 
(primary, 34.2%; secondary, 73.7%), 41.3% to LFX (primary, 35.6%; secondary, 
63.2%), 76.1% to metronidazole (MTZ) and 1.1% to amoxicillin. Multidrug 
resistance was observed in 56.5% (primary, 50.7%; secondary, 78.9%) of isolates 
(P<0.05). The rate of resistance to LFX was significantly higher in females than 
males (P<0.05). Most of the CLA- and LFX-resistant strains harboured 
resistance-associated mutations, with common positions at A2143G and T2182C in 
the 23S rRNA gene and at Asn-87 or Asp-91 in GyrA. Minimum inhibitory 
concentrations (MICs) increased in strains carrying quadruple mutations in their 
23S rRNA gene and in strains with Asn-87 GyrA mutation (P<0.05). One high-level 
LFX-resistant strain (MIC=32mg/L) had new mutations with a combination of N87A, 
A88N and V65I. High resistance rates to CLA, MTZ and LFX discourage standard and 
LFX-based triple therapies as first-line treatment in Vietnam.
