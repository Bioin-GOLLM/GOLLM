Glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant protein (GARP) associates with latent 
transforming growth factor-β (proTGFβ) on the surface of T regulatory cells and 
platelets; however, whether GARP functions in latent TGFβ activation and the 
structural basis of coassociation remain unknown. We find that Cys-192 and 
Cys-331 of GARP disulfide link to the TGFβ1 prodomain and that GARP with C192A 
and C331A mutations can also noncovalently associate with proTGFβ1. Noncovalent 
association is sufficiently strong for GARP to outcompete latent TGFβ-binding 
protein for binding to proTGFβ1. Association between GARP and proTGFβ1 prevents 
the secretion of TGFβ1. Integrin α(V)β(6) and to a lesser extent α(V)β(8) are 
able to activate TGFβ from the GARP-proTGFβ1 complex. Activation requires the 
RGD motif of latent TGFβ, disulfide linkage between GARP and latent TGFβ, and 
membrane association of GARP. Our results show that GARP is a latent 
TGFβ-binding protein that functions in regulating the bioavailability and 
activation of TGFβ.
