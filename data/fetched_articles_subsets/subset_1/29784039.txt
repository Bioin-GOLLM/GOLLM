BACKGROUND: Mutations in keratin proteins have been vastly associated with a 
wide array of genodermatoses; however, mutations of keratins in psoriasis have 
not been fully investigated. The main aim of the current research was to 
identify the mutation in K14, K10, K16, and K17 genes in two stages of psoriasis 
patients.
METHODS: Ninety-six psoriatic skin biopsies were collected. mRNA transcript of 
K14, K10, K16, and K17 was prepared, amplified, and sequenced. Sanger sequences 
of all keratins were further validated for mutational analysis using Mutation 
Surveyor and Alamut Visual. Then, in silico analysis of protein stability and 
protein and gene expression of all keratins was performed and validated.
RESULTS: Out of 44 mutations, about 75% of keratins are highly pathogenic and 
deleterious. Remaining 25% mutations are less pathogenic and tolerated in 
nature. In these 33 deleterious mutations were immensely found to decrease 
keratin protein stability. We also found a correlation between keratin and 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score which added that alteration in keratin 
gene in skin causes severity of psoriasis.
CONCLUSIONS: We strongly concluded that acanthosis and abnormal terminal 
differentiation was mainly due to the mutation in epidermal keratins. In turn, 
disease severity and relapsing of psoriasis are mainly due to the mutation of 
hyperproliferative keratins. These novel keratin mutations in psoriatic 
epidermis might be one of the causative factors for psoriasis.
