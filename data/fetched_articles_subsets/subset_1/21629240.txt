Clinicians who treat patients with stroke need to be aware of several 
single-gene disorders that have ischemic stroke as a major feature, including 
sickle cell disease, Fabry disease, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy 
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, and retinal vasculopathy with 
cerebral leukodystrophy. The reported genome-wide association studies of 
ischemic stroke and several related phenotypes (for example, ischemic white 
matter disease) have shown that no single common genetic variant imparts major 
risk. Larger studies with samples numbering in the thousands are ongoing to 
identify common variants with smaller effects on risk. Pharmacogenomic studies 
have uncovered genetic determinants of response to warfarin, statins and 
clopidogrel. Despite increasing knowledge of stroke genetics, incorporating this 
new knowledge into clinical practice remains a challenge. The goals of this 
article are to review common single-gene disorders relevant to ischemic stroke, 
summarize the status of candidate gene and genome-wide studies aimed at 
discovering genetic stroke risk factors, and to briefly discuss pharmacogenomics 
related to stroke treatment.
