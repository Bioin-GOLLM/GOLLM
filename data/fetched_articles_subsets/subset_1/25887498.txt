A phase I study of danusertib (PHA-739358) in adult patients with accelerated or 
blastic phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia resistant or intolerant to imatinib and/or other 
second generation c-ABL therapy.

Danusertib is a pan-aurora kinase inhibitor with potent activity against Abl 
kinase including the gatekeeper T315I mutant. A phase 1 dose escalation study of 
danusertib was conducted in patients with accelerated or blastic phase chronic 
myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia. Two dosing schedules were studied: schedule A, in which danusertib was 
given by 3-hour intravenous infusion daily for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) in 
a 14-day cycle, and schedule B, in which the danusertib was given by 3-hour 
intravenous infusion daily for 14 consecutive days (days 1-14) in a 21-day 
cycle. A total of 37 patients were treated, 29 with schedule A and eight with 
schedule B. The recommended phase 2 dose for schedule A was 180 mg/m(2). 
Enrollment to schedule B was stopped early because of logistical problems with 
the frequency of infusions. Febrile neutropenia and mucositis were dose-limiting 
toxicities in schedule A. Four patients with T315I ABL kinase mutation, all 
treated with schedule A, responded. Danusertib has an acceptable toxicity 
profile and is active in patients with Bcr-Abl-associated advanced hematologic 
malignancies. This study was registered with the European Clinical Trails Data 
Base (EudraCT number 2007-004070-18).
