BACKGROUND: Variable domains of camelid heavy-chain antibodies, commonly named 
nanobodies, have high biotechnological potential. In view of their broad range 
of applications in research, diagnostics and therapy, engineering their 
stability is of particular interest. One important aspect is the improvement of 
thermostability, because it can have immediate effects on conformational 
stability, protease resistance and aggregation propensity of the protein.
METHODS: We analyzed the sequences and thermostabilities of 78 purified nanobody 
binders. From this data, potentially stabilizing amino acid variations were 
identified and studied experimentally.
RESULTS: Some mutations improved the stability of nanobodies by up to 6.1°C, 
with an average of 2.3°C across eight modified nanobodies. The stabilizing 
mechanism involves an improvement of both conformational stability and 
aggregation behavior, explaining the variable degree of stabilization in 
individual molecules. In some instances, variations predicted to be stabilizing 
actually led to thermal destabilization of the proteins. The reasons for this 
contradiction between prediction and experiment were investigated.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a mutational strategy to improve the biophysical 
behavior of nanobody binders and indicate a species-specificity of nanobody 
architecture.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study illustrates the potential and limitations of 
engineering nanobody thermostability by merging sequence information with 
stability data, an aspect that is becoming increasingly important with the 
recent development of high-throughput biophysical methods.
