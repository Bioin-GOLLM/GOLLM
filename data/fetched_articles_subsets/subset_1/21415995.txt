Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) still remains the only definitive 
cure currently available for patients with thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. 
Results of transplant in thalassemia and in sickle cell anemia have steadily 
improved over the last two decades due to improvements in preventive strategies, 
and effective control of transplant-related complications. From 2004 through 
2009, 145 consecutive patients with thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, 
ethnically heterogeneous from Mediterranean and Middle East countries, were 
given HSCT in the International Center for Transplantation in Thalassemia and 
Sickle Cella Anemia in Rome. This experience is characterized by two 
peculiarities: patients were ethnically very heterogeneous and the vast majority 
of these patients were not regularly transfesed/chelated and therefore were 
highly sensitized due to RBC transfusions without leukodepletion filters. 
Consequently, they could have a high risk of graft rejection as a result of 
sensitization to HLA antigens. The Rome experience of SCT in patients with 
thalassemia and sickle cell anemia confirmed the results obtained in Pesaro, and 
most importantly showed the reproducibility of these results in other centers.
