To achieve the very high oncoprotein levels required to drive the malignant 
state cancer cells utilise the ubiquitin proteasome system to upregulate 
transcription factor levels. Here our analyses identify ALYREF, expressed from 
the most common genetic copy number variation in neuroblastoma, chromosome 
17q21-ter gain as a key regulator of MYCN protein turnover. We show strong 
co-operativity between ALYREF and MYCN from transgenic models of neuroblastoma 
in vitro and in vivo. The two proteins form a nuclear coactivator complex which 
stimulates transcription of the ubiquitin specific peptidase 3, USP3. We show 
that increased USP3 levels reduce K-48- and K-63-linked ubiquitination of MYCN, 
thus driving up MYCN protein stability. In the MYCN-ALYREF-USP3 signal, ALYREF 
is required for MYCN effects on the malignant phenotype and that of USP3 on MYCN 
stability. This data defines a MYCN oncoprotein dependency state which provides 
a rationale for future pharmacological studies.
