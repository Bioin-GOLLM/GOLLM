Orexinergic system consisting of orexins and orexin receptors plays an essential 
role in regulating sleep-wake states, whereas sleep disruption is a common 
symptom of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence reveals 
that the orexinergic system is disturbed in various neurodegenerative diseases, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's 
disease (HD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas the dysregulation of orexins 
and/or orexin receptors contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In 
this review, we summarized advanced knowledge of the orexinergic system and its 
role in sleep, and reviewed the dysregulation of the orexinergic system and its 
role in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, HD, and MS. Moreover, the therapeutic 
potential of targeting the orexinergic system for the treatment of these 
diseases was discussed.
