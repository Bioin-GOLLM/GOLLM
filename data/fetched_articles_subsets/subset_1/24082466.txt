Thalassemia has been recognized by the World Health Organization as important 
inherited disorders principally impacting on the populations of low income 
countries. In this report, the prevalence of common β-thalassemia mutations in 
India was defined in 126 β-thalassemia carrier subjects in a western Indian 
population mainly from the south-western Maharashtra. The six most common 
β-thalassemia mutations were detected, which included IVS I-5 (G-C), IVS I-1 
(G-T), codon 8-9 (+G), codon 41/42 (-TCTT), Codon 15 (G-A), and 619 bp deletion 
at 3' end of β-globin gene. These mutations accounted for 93.66 % in 126 
β-thalassemia carrier subjects and 6.34 % remained uncharacterized. Out of 126, 
82 (65.07 %) showed the most common (prevalent) type of mutation, IVS I-5 (G-C), 
followed by IVS I-1 (G-T) showed by 12 (9.52 %) subjects. Three (2.38 %) 
subjects showed 619 bp deletion, codon 8/9 (+G) and codon 15 (G-A) mutations 
were present in eight subjects each (6.34 %). Only five (3.96 %) subjects showed 
codon 41/42 (-TCTT). There were eight (6.34 %) subjects where mutation was not 
any of the six mutations studied. This study provides the pattern of β 
thalassemia mutations from south-western Maharashtra, which will help to prevent 
β-thalassemia using prenatal diagnosis and proper counseling.
