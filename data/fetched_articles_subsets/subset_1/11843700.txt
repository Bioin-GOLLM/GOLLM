BACKGROUND: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. The 
most common form of HSP is caused by mutations in the SPG4 gene, which codes for 
spastin, an adenosine triphosphatase with various cellular activities (AAA) 
protein family member.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate a large collection of predominantly North American 
patients with HSP for mutations in the spastin encoding gene, SPG4.
METHODS: DNA from 76 unrelated affected individuals was studied for mutations by 
single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Each 
new variant identified was then analyzed in 80 control subjects to determine 
whether the variant is a common polymorphism or a rare mutation. All DNA samples 
were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, followed by electrophoresis and 
autoradiography.
RESULTS: We identified 8 novel mutations and 5 previously reported mutations in 
15 affected individuals. The novel mutations are 4 missense, 1 nonsense, 1 
frameshift, and 2 splice mutations. Two polymorphisms (one in an affected 
individual) were also identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Our collection of families with HSP is different on a genetic level 
from those previously described. The percentage of our families with a SPG4 
mutation is 10% lower than the 40% estimate of families with autosomal dominant 
HSP noted to be linked to this locus, and splice mutations are not predominant 
in our collection. Interestingly, we also identified 2 recurring mutations in 
specific populations (R562Q and G559D), which may facilitate the development of 
future spastin diagnostic testing in these populations.
