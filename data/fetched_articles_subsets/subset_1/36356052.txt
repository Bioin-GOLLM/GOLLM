Numerous safe and effective coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines have been 
developed worldwide that use various delivery technologies and engineering 
strategies. We show here that vaccines containing prefusion-stabilizing S 
mutations elicit antibody responses in humans with enhanced recognition of S and 
the S1 subunit relative to postfusion S as compared with vaccines lacking these 
mutations or natural infection. Prefusion S and S1 antibody binding titers 
positively and equivalently correlated with neutralizing activity, and depletion 
of S1-directed antibodies completely abrogated plasma neutralizing activity. We 
show that neutralizing activity is almost entirely directed to the S1 subunit 
and that variant cross-neutralization is mediated solely by receptor binding 
domain-specific antibodies. Our data provide a quantitative framework for 
guiding future S engineering efforts to develop vaccines with higher resilience 
to the emergence of variants than current technologies.
