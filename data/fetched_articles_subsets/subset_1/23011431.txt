Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) remains an important regulatory element in 
prefrontal cortex dopamine homeostasis. The literature data suggest that 
individual differences in COMT activity (Val158Met polymorphism) might have 
indirect downstream effects on the reward system. The aim of the present study 
was to examine whether COMT deletion affects reinforcing effects of cocaine in 
mice. The study was conducted in male mice with homozygous COMT deletion as well 
as their C57BL/6J wild-type littermates. Animals were trained to nose-poke to 
receive response-contingent intravenous infusions of cocaine (0.3 mg/kg per 
infusion; final schedule of reinforcement - fixed ratio (FR) 3 time out 30 s). 
Following the initial acquisition phase, cocaine self-administration dose-effect 
functions (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg per infusion) were determined under 
FR3 and progressive ratio (PR) schedules of reinforcement. Cocaine 
dose-dependently maintained responding under FR3 and PR schedule of 
reinforcement when the unit dose of cocaine was varied across the sessions. The 
total cocaine intake did not differ in COMT deletion mice and wild-type mice. 
The results of this study suggest that individual differences in COMT activity 
do not affect primary reinforcing effects of cocaine in mice.
