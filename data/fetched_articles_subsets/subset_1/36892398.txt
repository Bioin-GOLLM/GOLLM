INTRODUCTION: Mucosal melanoma is a rare neoplasm. Late diagnosis is caused by 
occult anatomic sites and scarcity of symptoms. Novel biological therapies have 
now become available. Demographic, therapeutical and survival records on mucosal 
melanoma are scarce.
OBJECTIVES: To provide an 11-year retrospective clinical review of real-world 
data on mucosal melanomas managed in a tertiary referral center in Italy.
METHODS: We included patients with histopathological mucosal melanoma diagnoses 
from January 2011 to December 2021. Data were collected until the last known 
follow-up or death. Survival analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Among 33 patients, we found 9 sinonasal, 13 anorectal and 11 urogenital 
mucosal melanomas (median age 82, females 66.7%). Eighteen cases (54.5%) 
presented with metastasis (p<0.05). In the urogenital subgroup, only 4 patients 
(36.4%) had metastasis at diagnosis, all in regional lymph nodes. Sinonasal 
melanomas were surgically managed with a debulking procedure (44.4%); every case 
of anorectal and urogenital melanomas underwent radical surgery (30.8% and 
45.5%). Fifteen patients were treated with biological therapy (p<0.05). 
Radiation therapy was used in all melanomas of the sinonasal region (p<0.05). 
Overall survival was longer for urogenital melanomas (26 months). Univariate 
analysis showed an increased hazard ratio for death in patients with metastasis. 
A negative prognostic value of metastatic status was reported by the 
multivariate model, while administration of first-line immunotherapy 
demonstrated a protective role.
CONCLUSIONS: At diagnosis, the absence of metastatic disease is the most 
relevant factor that influences the survival of mucosal melanomas. Moreover, the 
use of immunotherapy might prolong the survival of metastatic mucosal melanoma 
patients.
