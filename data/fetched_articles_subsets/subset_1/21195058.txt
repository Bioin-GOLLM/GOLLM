The gastrointestinal hormone gastrin is generated from an 80 amino acid 
precursor (progastrin) by cleavage after dibasic residues by prohormone 
convertase 1. Phosphorylation of Ser(75) has previously been suggested, on the 
basis of indirect evidence, to inhibit cleavage of progastrin after 
Arg(73)Arg(74). Gastrins bind two ferric ions with high affinity, and iron 
binding is essential for the biological activity of non-amidated gastrins in 
vitro and in vivo. This study directly investigated the effect of iron binding 
and of serine phosphorylation on the cleavage of synthetic progastrin-derived 
peptides. The affinity of synthetic progastrin(55-80) for ferric ions, and the 
rate of cleavage by prohormone convertase 1, were not affected by 
phosphorylation of Ser(75). In contrast, in the presence of ferric ions the rate 
of cleavage of both progastrin(55-80) and phosphoSer(75)progastrin(55-80) by 
prohormone convertase 1 was significantly reduced. Hence iron binding to 
progastrin may regulate processing and secretion in vivo, and regulation may be 
particularly important in diseases with altered iron homeostasis.
