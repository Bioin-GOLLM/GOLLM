OBJECTIVES: Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is a form of coronary artery disease 
(CAD) requiring percutaneous coronary intervention. There has been minimal 
research regarding CTO-specific risk factors and predictive models. We developed 
machine learning predictive models based on clinical characteristics to identify 
patients with CTO before coronary angiography.
METHODS: Data from 1473 patients with CAD, including 317 patients with and 1156 
patients without CTO, were retrospectively analyzed. Partial least squares 
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF), and support vector machine 
(SVM) models were used to identify CTO-specific risk factors and predict CTO 
development. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was 
performed for model validation.
RESULTS: For CTO prediction, the PLS-DA model included 10 variables; the ROC 
value was 0.706. The RF model included 42 variables; the ROC value was 0.702. 
The SVM model included 20 variables; the ROC value was 0.696. DeLong's test 
showed no difference among the three models. Four variables were present in all 
models: sex, neutrophil percentage, creatinine, and brain natriuretic peptide 
(BNP).
CONCLUSIONS: Validation of machine learning prediction models for CTO revealed 
that the PLS-DA model had the best prediction performance. Sex, neutrophil 
percentage, creatinine, and BNP may be important risk factors for CTO 
development.
