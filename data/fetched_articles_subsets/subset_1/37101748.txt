Introduction: The application of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) for 
cancer therapy has been studied for decades; however, the targeted delivery of 
TiO2 NPs to tumor tissues is challenging, and its efficiency needs to be 
improved. Method: In this study, we designed an oxygen-deficient TiO2-x coated 
with glutamine layer for targeted delivery, as well as the enhanced separation 
of electrons (e-) and holes (h+) following the joint application of sonodynamic 
therapy (SDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Results: This oxygen-deficient 
TiO2-x possesses relatively high photothermal and sonodynamic efficiency at the 
1064 nm NIR-II bio-window. The GL-dependent design eased the penetration of the 
TiO2-x into the tumor tissues (approximately three-fold). The in vitro and in 
vivo tests showed that the SDT/PTT-based synergistic treatment achieved more 
optimized therapeutic effects than the sole use of either SDT or PTT. 
Conclusion: Our study provided a safety targeted delivery strategy, and enhanced 
the therapeutic efficiency of SDT/PTT synergistic treatment.
