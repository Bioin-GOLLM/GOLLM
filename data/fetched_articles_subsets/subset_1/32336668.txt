Living organisms are surrounded with heavy metals such as methylmercury, 
manganese, cobalt, cadmium, arsenic, as well as pesticides such as deltamethrin 
and paraquat, or atmospheric pollutants such as quinone. Extensive studies have 
demonstrated a strong link between environmental pollutants and human health. 
Redox toxicity is proposed as one of the main mechanisms of chemical-induced 
pathology in humans. Acting as both a sensor of oxidative stress and a positive 
regulator of antioxidants, the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 
(NRF2) has attracted recent attention. However, the role NRF2 plays in 
environmental pollutant-induced toxicity has not been systematically addressed. 
Here, we characterize NRF2 function in response to various pollutants, such as 
metals, pesticides and atmospheric quinones. NRF2 related signaling pathways and 
epigenetic regulations are also reviewed.
