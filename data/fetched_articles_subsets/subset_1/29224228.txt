Interleukin 15 (IL15) and IL7 are two cytokines essential for T cell development 
and homeostasis. In order to improve the antitumor activity by Newcastle disease 
virus (NDV)-modified tumor vaccine, we generated a recombinant NDV co-expressing 
IL15 and IL7 (LX/IL(15+7)) through incorporation of a 2A self-processing peptide 
into IL15 and IL7 using reverse genetics. B16 cells infected with LX/IL(15+7) 
expressed both IL15 and IL7 stably. The cytotoxicity assay showed that murine 
melanoma cells modified with LX/IL(15+7) could significantly enhance the 
antitumor immune response in vitro. Then, the antitumor effects of tumor vaccine 
modified with recombinant virus were tested in the murine tumor models. We 
observed strong antitumor responses induced by LX/IL(15+7)-modified tumor cells 
both in prophylaxis and therapeutic models. Although the tumor-infiltrating CD4+ 
T cells and CD8+ T cells were both increased, the antitumor activity of the 
tumor vaccine modified with LX/IL(15+7) was dependent on CD8+ T cells. Taken 
together, our data strongly indicated that tumor vaccine modified with NDV 
strain LX/IL(15+7) is a promising agent for cancer immunotherapy.
