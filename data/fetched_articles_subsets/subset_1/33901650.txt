OBJECTIVE: To determine if viable virus could be isolated from the air within a 
car driven by a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to assess the size range 
of the infectious particles.
METHODS: We used a Sioutas personal cascade impactor sampler (PCIS) to screen 
for SARS-CoV-2 in a car driven by a COVID-19 patient. The patient, who had only 
mild illness without fever or cough and was not wearing a mask, drove the car 
for 15 min with the air conditioning turned on and windows closed. The PCIS was 
clipped to the sun-visor above the front passenger seat and was retrieved from 
the car two hours after completion of the drive.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detectable at all PCIS stages by PCR and was cultured 
from the section of the sampler collecting particles in the 0.25-0.50 μm size 
range.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 
minimally symptomatic persons in the closed space inside of a car and suggest 
that a substantial component of that risk is via aerosolized virus.
