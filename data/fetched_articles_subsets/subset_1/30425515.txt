BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming occurs in the tumor microenvironment and 
influences the survival and function of tumor and immune cells. Interferon-γ 
(IFN-γ) produced by T cells up-regulates PD-L1 expression in tumors. However, 
reports regarding the relationship between nutrient metabolism and the 
up-regulation of PD-L1 expression are lacking.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we analyzed the metabolic changes in T 
cells and bladder cancer cells in a simulated tumor microenvironment to provide 
evidence regarding their relevance to PD-L1 up-regulation.
RESULTS: The glutaminolysis was increased in both activated T cells and 
glucose-deprived T cells. IFN-γ production by T cells was decreased in a 
glucose-free medium and severely decreased when cells were simultaneously 
deprived of glutamine. Furthermore, the glutaminolysis of the bladder cancer 
cells under glucose deprivation exhibited a compensatory elevation. The glucose 
concentration of T cells co-cultured with bladder cancer cells was decreased and 
T cell proliferation was reduced, but IFN-γ production and glutaminolysis were 
increased. However, in bladder cancer cells, the elevation in glutaminolysis 
under co-culture conditions did not compensate for glucose deprivation because 
the glucose concentration in the culture medium did not significantly differ 
between the cultures with and without T cells. Our data also show that 
inhibiting glutamine metabolism in bladder cancer cells could reduce the 
elevation in PD-L1 expression induced by IFN-γ.
CONCLUSION: In a simulated tumor microenvironment, elevated glutaminolysis may 
play an essential role in IFN-γ production by T cells, ultimately improving the 
high PD-L1 expression, and also directly contributing to producing more PD-L1 in 
bladder cancer cells.
