Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold much promise in the quest for 
personalised cell therapies. However, the persistence of founder cell 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations limits the potential of iPSCs in the 
development of treatments for mtDNA disease. This problem may be overcome by 
using oocytes containing healthy mtDNA, to induce somatic cell nuclear 
reprogramming. However, the extent to which somatic cell mtDNA persists 
following fusion with human oocytes is unknown. Here we show that human nuclear 
transfer (NT) embryos contain very low levels of somatic cell mtDNA. In light of 
a recent report that embryonic stem cells can be derived from human NT embryos, 
our results highlight the therapeutic potential of NT for mtDNA disease, and 
underscore the importance of using human oocytes to pursue this goal.
