The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) acts via a canonical 
pathway to regulate circulating low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) via 
degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) on the liver cell surface. Published 
research has shown that PCSK9 is involved in atherosclerosis via a variety of 
non-classical mechanisms that involve lysosomal, inflammatory, apoptotic, 
mitochondrial, and immune pathways. In this review paper, we summarized these 
additional mechanisms and described how anti-PCSK9 therapy exerts effects 
through these mechanisms. These additional pathways further illustrate the 
regulatory role of PCSK9 in atherosclerosis and offer an in-depth interpretation 
of how the PCSK9 inhibitor exerts effects on the treatment of atherosclerosis.
