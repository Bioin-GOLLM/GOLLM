BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus genomes are comprised of 8 negative strand 
single-stranded RNA segments and are thought to encode 11 proteins, which are 
all translated from mRNAs complementary to the genomic strands. Although human, 
swine and avian influenza A viruses are very similar, cross-species infections 
are usually limited. However, antigenic differences are considerable and when 
viruses become established in a different host or if novel viruses are created 
by re-assortment devastating pandemics may arise.
RESULTS: Examination of influenza A virus genomes from the early 20th Century 
revealed the association of a 167 codon ORF encoded by the genomic strand of 
segment 8 with human isolates. Close to the timing of the 1948 pseudopandemic, a 
mutation occurred that resulted in the extension of this ORF to 216 codons. 
Since 1948, this ORF has been almost totally maintained in human influenza A 
viruses suggesting a selectable biological function. The discovery of cytotoxic 
T cells responding to an epitope encoded by this ORF suggests that it is 
translated into protein. Evidence of several other non-traditionally translated 
polypeptides in influenza A virus support the translation of this genomic strand 
ORF. The gene product is predicted to have a signal sequence and two 
transmembrane domains.
CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that the genomic strand of segment 8 of encodes a 
novel influenza A virus protein. The persistence and conservation of this 
genomic strand ORF for almost a century in human influenza A viruses provides 
strong evidence that it is translated into a polypeptide that enhances viral 
fitness in the human host. This has important consequences for the 
interpretation of experiments that utilize mutations in the NS1 and NEP genes of 
segment 8 and also for the consideration of events that may alter the spread 
and/or pathogenesis of swine and avian influenza A viruses in the human 
population.
