Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to associate with all major types 
of malignancies and play important roles in regulating several hallmarks of 
cancer by interacting with proteins, DNA, and RNA. The possible functions of 
lncRNAs and their roles in the regulation of tumour growth will be reported and 
discussed in the present review. In our recent report, based on genetic mice 
models and a series of systematic analyses, we suggested that lncRNAs also play 
critical roles in the regulation of antigen presentation in tumour cells and 
allow tumour cells to escape immune surveillance, which further broadens the 
scope of understanding lncRNA functions and how they relate to cancer 
immunotherapy resistance.
