Novel genome editing and transient gene therapies have been developed the past 
ten years, resulting in the first in-human clinical trials for monogenic 
disorders. Syndromic autism spectrum disorders can be caused by mutations in a 
single gene. Given the monogenic aspect and severity of syndromic ASD, it is an 
ideal candidate for gene therapies. Here, we selected 11 monogenic ASD 
syndromes, validated by animal models, and reviewed current gene therapies for 
each syndrome. Given the wide variety and novelty of some forms of gene therapy, 
the best possible option must be decided based on the gene and mutation.
