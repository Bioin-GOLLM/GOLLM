The stressosome is a pseudo-icosahedral megadalton bacterial stress-sensing 
protein complex consisting of several copies of two STAS-domain proteins, RsbR 
and RsbS, and the kinase RsbT. Upon perception of environmental stress multiple 
copies of RsbT are released from the surface of the stressosome. Free RsbT 
activates downstream proteins to elicit a global cellular response, such as the 
activation of the general stress response in Gram-positive bacteria. The 
molecular events triggering RsbT release from the stressosome surface remain 
poorly understood. Here we present the map of Listeria innocua RsbR1/RsbS 
complex at resolutions of 3.45 Å for the STAS domain core in icosahedral 
symmetry and of 3.87 Å for the STAS domain and N-terminal sensors in D2 
symmetry, respectively. The structure reveals a conformational change in the 
STAS domain linked to phosphorylation in RsbR. Docking studies indicate that 
allosteric RsbT binding to the conformationally flexible N-terminal sensor 
domain of RsbR affects the affinity of RsbS towards RsbT. Our results bring to 
focus the molecular events within the stressosome complex and further our 
understanding of this ubiquitous signaling hub.
