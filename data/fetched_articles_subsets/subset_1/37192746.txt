BACKGROUND: Both exosomes and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in tumor 
growth. Hsa_circ_0001492 (circERBB2IP) has been reported to be overexpressed in 
plasma exosomes from patients with lung adenocarcinoma, but the biological role 
of exosomal circERBB2IP in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is indistinct.
METHODS: Exosomes isolated from serums and medium samples were validated by 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), 
and western blotting. Relative expression of circERBB2IP was detected by 
RT-qPCR. Loss-of-function was done to determine the effect of circERBB2IP on 
NSCLC cell proliferation and migration. Molecular mechanisms associated with 
circERBB2IP were predicted by bioinformatic analysis and validated by 
dual-luciferase reporter, RIP, and RNA pulldown assays. In vivo experiments were 
performed to identify the function of circERBB2IP in NSCLC.
RESULTS: We discovered that circERBB2IP expression was correlated with TNM 
grade, lymph node metastasis and tumor size of NSCLC patients. Upregulation of 
circERBB2IP was observed in exosomes derived from NSCLC patient's serum and 
circERBB2IP might be a potential diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC. CircERBB2IP was 
transmitted between carcinoma cells through exosomes. Knockdown of circERBB2IP 
lowered cell growth in mouse models and restrained NSCLC cell proliferation and 
migration. CircERBB2IP could mediate PSAT1 expression via sponging miR-5195-3p.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, circERBB2IP may drive NSCLC growth by the 
miR-5195-3p/PSAT1 axis in NSCLC, shedding light on a diagnostic biomarker and 
therapeutic target for NSCLC.
