BACKGROUND: Several host genetic factors are thought to affect susceptibility to 
Helicobacter pylori infection-related diseases, including tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-Î±. Previous studies have evaluated the association between TNFA gene 
polymorphisms and H. pylori infection, but the results were inconclusive. We 
conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the association between TNFA 
polymorphisms and H. pylori infection.
METHODS: Published literature within PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library 
were used in our meta-analysis. Data were analyzed with the Stata13.1 software 
package using pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were included in our study. The TNFA -308G>A 
polymorphism was associated with decreasing H. pylori infection (AA vs. AG+GG, 
OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43-0.97; AA vs. GG, OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.43-0.97). A 
significantly decreased risk was also found for -1031T>C polymorphism (CC vs. 
CT+TT, OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.44-0.84). -863C>A polymorphism was associated with 
increasing risk of H. pylori infection (AA+AC vs. CC, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 
1.16-1.86; A allele vs. C allele, OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.14-1.72). There was no 
significant association between -857C>T polymorphism and H. pylori infection. 
When stratified analysis was conducted on H. pylori infection detection methods, 
-857C>T and -863C>A polymorphisms were associated with H. pylori infection for 
the non-ELISA subgroup. When stratified for ethnicity or study design, -863C>A 
significantly increased the risk and -1031T>C decreased the risk for the Asian 
subgroup and hospital-based subgroup.
CONCLUSION: Results of our meta-analysis demonstrate that TNFA -308G>A and -1031 
T>C polymorphisms may be protective factors against H. pylori infection, and 
-863C>A may be a risk factor, especially in Asian populations. Further studies 
with larger sample sizes are required to validate these results.
