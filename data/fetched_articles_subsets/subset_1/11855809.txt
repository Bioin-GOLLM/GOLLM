Protein kinase D (PKD/PKCmu immunoprecipitated from either COS-7 cells or Jurkat 
T lymphocytes transiently transfected with a constitutively active mutant of 
PKCtheta AE (PKCthetaAE) exhibited a marked increase in basal activity. In 
contrast, coexpression of constitutively active mutant of PKCzeta does not 
induce PKD activation in both types of cells. PKCthetaAE does not induce kinase 
activity in immunocomplexes of PKD kinase-deficient mutants PKDK618N or 
PKDD733A. PKD activation in response to PKCthetaAE signaling was completely 
prevented by treatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, GF I or Ro 
31-8220, or by mutation of Ser-744 and Ser-748 to Ala in the kinase activation 
loop of PKD. Our results show that PKD is a downstream target of the theta 
isoform of PKC in both COS-7 cells and lymphocytes. The regulation of PKD by 
PKCtheta reveals a new pathway in the signaling network existing between 
multiple members of the PKC superfamily and PKD.
