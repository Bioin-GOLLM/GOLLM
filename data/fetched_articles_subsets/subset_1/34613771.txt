Most vertebrate lineages retain a tetrachromatic visual system, which is 
supported by a functional combination of spectrally distinct multiple cone 
photoreceptors, ultraviolet (UV), blue, green, and red cones. The blue cone 
identity is ensured by selective expression of blue (sws2) opsin, and the 
mechanism is poorly understood because sws2 gene has been lost in mammalian 
species such as mouse, whose visual system has been extensively studied. Here, 
we pursued loss-of-function studies on transcription factors expressed 
predominantly in zebrafish cone photoreceptors and identified Foxq2 as a blue 
coneâ€“specific factor driving sws2 gene expression. Foxq2 has dual functions 
acting as an activator of sws2 transcription and as a suppressor of UV (sws1) 
opsin transcription in blue cones. A wide range of vertebrate species retain 
both foxq2 and sws2 genes. We propose that Foxq2-dependent sws2 expression is a 
prevalent regulatory mechanism that was acquired at the early stage of 
vertebrate evolution.
