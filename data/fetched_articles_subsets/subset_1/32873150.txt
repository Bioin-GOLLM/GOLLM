Aberrant tumour necrosis factor (TNF) signalling is a hallmark of many 
inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), irritable bowel 
disease and lupus. Maladaptive TNF signalling can lead to hyper active 
downstream nuclear factor (NF)-κβ signalling in turn amplifying a cell's 
inflammatory response and exacerbating disease. Within the TNF intracellular 
inflammatory signalling cascade, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 
(TAK1) has been shown to play a critical role in mediating signal transduction 
and downstream NF-κβ activation. Owing to its role in TNF inflammatory 
signalling, TAK1 has become a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of 
inflammatory diseases such as RA. This review highlights the current development 
of targeting the TNF-TAK1 signalling axis as a novel therapeutic strategy for 
the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
