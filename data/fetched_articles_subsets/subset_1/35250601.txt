The classical terms agonists and antagonists for G protein coupled receptors 
(GPCRs) have often become misleading. Even the biased agonism concept does not 
describe all the possibilities already demonstrated for GPCRs. The cannabinoid 
CB2 receptor (CB2R) emerged as a promising target for a variety of diseases. 
Reasons for such huge potential are centered around the way drugs sit in the 
orthosteric and/or exosites of the receptor. On the one hand, a given drug in a 
specific CB2R conformation leads to a signaling cascade that differs 
qualitatively and/or quantitatively from that triggered by another drug. On the 
other hand, a given drug may lead to different signaling outputs in two 
different tissues (or cell contexts) in which the conformation of the receptor 
is affected by allosteric effects derived from interactions with other proteins 
or with membrane lipids. This highlights the pharmacological complexity of this 
receptor and the need to further unravel the binding mode of CB2R ligands in 
order to fine-tune signaling effects and therapeutic propositions.
