Genetic causes that contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) are not fully 
understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of five 
polymorphisms at MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 genes with risk of RPL. Methods: The 
study comprised 250 women with RPL and 250 healthy controls. The MMP-2 
(rs243865, rs2285053), MMP-3 (rs35068180), and MMP 9 (rs3918242, rs17576) 
polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Results: A significant association was 
found between MMP-3 rs35068180 polymorphism and RPL risk. There was no 
significant association between RPL and polymorphisms at MMP-2 (rs243865, 
rs2285053) and MMP 9 (rs3918242, rs17576) genes. Conclusion: MMP-3 rs35068180 
polymorphism may modulate RPL risk in Iranian women. There is no evidence to 
suggest that MMP-2 (rs243865, rs2285053) and MMP 9 (rs3918242, rs17576) 
polymorphisms are associated with RPL risk.
