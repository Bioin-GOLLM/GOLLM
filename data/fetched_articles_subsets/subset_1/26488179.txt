OBJECTIVE: To identify the features of Chinese genetic prion diseases.
METHODS: Suspected Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases that were reported 
under CJD surveillance were diagnosed and subtyped using the diagnostic criteria 
issued by the WHO. The general information concerning the patient, their 
clinical, MRI and EEG data, and the results of CSF 14-3-3 and PRNP sequencing 
were carefully collected from the database of the national CJD surveillance 
program and analyzed using the SPSS 11.5 statistical software program.
RESULTS: Since 2006, 69 patients were diagnosed with genetic prion diseases and 
as having 15 different mutations. The median age of the 69 patients at disease 
onset was 53.5 years, varying from 19 to 80 years. The majority of patients 
displaying clinical symptoms were in the 50-59 years of age. FFI, T188K gCJD and 
E200K were the three most common subtypes. The disease appeared in the family 
histories of 43.48% of the patients. The clinical manifestations varied 
considerably among the various diseases. Patients who carried mutations in the 
N-terminus displayed a younger age of onset, were CSF 14-3-3 negative, had a 
family history of the condition, and experienced a longer duration of the 
condition. The clinical courses of T188K were significantly shorter than those 
of FFI and E200K gCJD, while the symptoms in the FFI group appeared at a younger 
age and for a longer duration. Moreover, the time intervals between the initial 
neurologist visit to the final diagnosis were similar among patients with FFI, 
T188K gCJD, E200K gCJD and other diseases.
CONCLUSION: The features of Chinese genetic prion diseases are different from 
those seen in Europe and other Asian countries.
