BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a multifactorial disease with 
gene-environment interaction resulting in progressive renal function damage. 
Multiple studies have assessed the association between matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) gene promoter polymorphism and DN susceptibility. 
However, the results are inconclusive. In the present study, we will conduct a 
meta-analysis to further examine this relationship more precisely.
METHODS: Electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, 
Wanfang, China Biological Medicine and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) 
will be used to search clinical case-control studies about MMP-9 polymorphism 
and DN published until 18 August 2020. The language will be restricted to 
Chinese and English. Two reviewers will take charge of completing the selection 
of study, the extraction of data as well as the assessment of study quality 
independently. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used to evaluate the study 
quality. We will evaluate the association under 5 genetic models. Fixed-effects 
or random-effects models will be used to calculate the effect sizes of odds 
ratio and 95% confidence intervals. Afterwards, subgroup analysis will be 
conducted in terms of the ethnicity and genotyping method. Additionally, 
sensitivity analysis will be performed via sequentially omitting each of the 
included studies one at a time. The funnel plots, Egger regression test, and 
Begg rank correlation test will be used to test the potential publication bias. 
All the statistical analyses will be performed using Review Manager 5.3 and 
Stata 12.0.
RESULTS: This protocol reported according to the Preferred Reporting ltems for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement. This study 
will provide a better understanding of the association between MMP-9 
polymorphisms and DN risk.
CONCLUSION: Publishing this protocol will minimize the potential bias related to 
data mining, thus contributing to generation of reliable evidence.
