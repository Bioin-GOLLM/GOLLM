Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the malignant and lethal cancers. 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs(miRNAs) can affect the 
expression and target identification of miRNAs and lead to the formation of 
malignant tumors. However, little is known about whether microRNA-1269a 
(miR-1269a) SNPs affect the susceptibility and progression of HCC or their 
specific mechanism. The association between microRNA-1269a rs73239138 and the 
susceptibility to HCC was verified by MassARRAY assay in a large case-control 
sample. The effect of miR-1269a and the variant on the proliferation and 
apoptosis of HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry (FCM), CCK8 assay and 
Western blot. The target of miR-1269a was identified by bioinformatics analysis 
and qRT-PCR and its role on cell proliferative capacity was examined by CCK8 
assay. The expression level of miR-1269a was analyzed by qRT-PCR in HCC cells 
transfected with wild or variant type pre-miR-1269a plasmid.MiR-1269a produced a 
tumor suppressor effect by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis 
of human HCC cells, possibly via inhibiting the expression of its target genes 
SPATS2L and LRP6, which were tumor promoters. While, rs73239138 (G>A) in 
miR-1269a reduced the anticancer effect of miR-1269a possibly by attenuating its 
total amount in HCC cells or its target recognition, reduce its inhibition on 
target genes and promoted the susceptibility to HCC. Our findings for the first 
time proved that miR-1269a SNP plays a role in the occurrence and process of HCC 
and the relevant mechanism, in accompany with the discovery of the novel target 
genes of miR-1269a.
