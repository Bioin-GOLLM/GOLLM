BACKGROUND: The most common congenital heart disease in the newborn population, 
patent ductus arteriosus, accounts for significant morbidity in preterm 
newborns. In addition to prematurity and environmental factors, we hypothesized 
that genetic factors play a significant role in this condition.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify the contribution of 
genetic factors to the variance in liability for patent ductus arteriosus in 
premature newborns.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study (1991-2006) from 2 centers was 
performed by using zygosity data from premature twins born at < or =36 weeks' 
gestational age and surviving beyond 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Patent ductus 
arteriosus was diagnosed by echocardiography at each center. Mixed-effects 
logistic regression was used to assess the effect of specific covariates. Latent 
variable probit modeling was then performed to estimate the heritability of 
patent ductus arteriosus, and mixed-effects probit modeling was used to quantify 
the genetic component.
RESULTS: We obtained data from 333 dizygotic twin pairs and 99 monozygotic twin 
pairs from 2 centers (Yale University and University of Connecticut). Data on 
chorioamnionitis, antenatal steroids, gestational age, body weight, gender, 
respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing 
enterocolitis, oxygen supplementation, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were 
comparable between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. We found that gestational 
age, respiratory distress syndrome, and institution were significant covariates 
for patent ductus arteriosus. After controlling for specific covariates, genetic 
factors or the shared environment accounted for 76.1% of the variance in 
liability for patent ductus arteriosus.
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm patent ductus arteriosus is highly familial (contributed to 
by genetic and environmental factors), with the effect being mainly 
environmental, after controlling for known confounders.
