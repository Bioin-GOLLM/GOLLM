BACKGROUND: A common SCN5A polymorphism H558R (c.1673 A > G, rs1805124) improves 
sodium channel activity in mutated channels and known to be a genetic modifier 
of Brugada syndrome patients (BrS). We investigated clinical manifestations and 
underlying mechanisms of H558R in BrS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped H558R in 100 BrS (mean age 45 ± 14 years; 91 
men) and 1875 controls (mean age 54 ± 18 years; 1546 men). We compared clinical 
parameters in BrS with and without H558R (H558R+ vs. H558R- group, N = 9 vs. 
91). We also obtained right atrial sections from 30 patients during aortic 
aneurysm operations and compared SCN5A expression and methylation with or 
without H558R. H558R was less frequent in BrS than controls (9.0% vs. 19.2%, 
P = 0.028). The VF occurrence ratio was significantly lower (0% vs. 29.7%, 
P = 0.03) and spontaneous type 1 ECG was less observed in H558R+ than H558R- 
group (33.3% vs. 74.7%, P = 0.01). The SCN5A expression level was significantly 
higher and the methylation rate was significantly lower in sections with H558R 
(N = 10) than those without (0.98 ± 0.14 vs. 0.83 ± 0.19, P = 0.04; 0.7 ± 0.2% 
vs. 1.6 ± 0.1%, P = 0.004, respectively). In BrS with heterozygous H558R, the A 
allele mRNA expression was 1.38 fold higher than G allele expression.
CONCLUSION: The SCN5A polymorphism H558R may be a modifier that protects against 
VF occurrence in BrS. The H558R decreased the SCN5A promoter methylation and 
increased the expression level in cardiac tissue. An allelic expression 
imbalance in BrS with a heterozygous H558R may also contribute to the protective 
effects in heterozygous mutations.
