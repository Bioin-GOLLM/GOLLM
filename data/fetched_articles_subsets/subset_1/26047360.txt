Male moths use species-specific sex pheromones to identify and orientate toward 
conspecific females. Odorant receptors (ORs) for sex pheromone substances have 
been identified as sex pheromone receptors in various moth species. However, 
direct in vivo evidence linking the functional role of these ORs with 
behavioural responses is lacking. In the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, female moths 
emit two sex pheromone components, bombykol and bombykal, but only bombykol 
elicits sexual behaviour in male moths. A sex pheromone receptor BmOR1 is 
specifically tuned to bombykol and is expressed in specialized olfactory 
receptor neurons (ORNs) in the pheromone sensitive long sensilla trichodea of 
male silkmoth antennae. Here, we show that disruption of the BmOR1 gene, 
mediated by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), completely 
removes ORN sensitivity to bombykol and corresponding pheromone-source searching 
behaviour in male moths. Furthermore, transgenic rescue of BmOR1 restored normal 
behavioural responses to bombykol. Our results demonstrate that BmOR1 is 
required for the physiological and behavioural response to bombykol, 
demonstrating that it is the receptor that mediates sex pheromone responses in 
male silkmoths. This study provides the first direct evidence that a member of 
the sex pheromone receptor family in moth species mediates conspecific sex 
pheromone information for sexual behaviour.
