Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a leading cause of blindness. To date, 260 
disease-causing genes have been identified, but there is currently a lack of 
available and effective treatment options. Cone photoreceptors are responsible 
for daylight vision but are highly susceptible to disease progression, the loss 
of cone-mediated vision having the highest impact on the quality of life of IRD 
patients. Cone degeneration can occur either directly via mutations in 
cone-specific genes (primary cone death), or indirectly via the primary 
degeneration of rods followed by subsequent degeneration of cones (secondary 
cone death). How cones degenerate as a result of pathological mutations remains 
unclear, hindering the development of effective therapies for IRDs. This review 
aims to highlight similarities and differences between primary and secondary 
cone cell death in inherited retinal diseases in order to better define cone 
death mechanisms and further identify potential treatment options.
