Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) act against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), organic peroxides, 
and peroxynitrite. Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1, an anaerobic archaeon, 
contains many antioxidant proteins, including three Prxs (Tk0537, Tk0815, and 
Tk1055). Only Tk0537 has been found to be induced in response to heat, osmotic, 
and oxidative stress. Tk0537 was found to belong to a 1-Cys Prx6 subfamily based 
on sequence analysis and was named 1-Cys TkPrx. Using gel filtration 
chromatography, electron microscopy, and blue-native polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis, we observed that 1-Cys TkPrx exhibits oligomeric forms with 
reduced peroxide reductase activity as well as decameric and dodecameric forms 
that can act as molecular chaperones by protecting both proteins and DNA from 
oxidative stress. Mutational analysis showed that a cysteine residue at the 
N-terminus (Cys46) was responsible for the peroxide reductase activity, and 
cysteine residues at the C-terminus (Cys205 and Cys211) were important for 
oligomerization. Based on our results, we propose that interconversion between 
different oligomers is important for regulating the different functions of 1-Cys 
TkPrx.
