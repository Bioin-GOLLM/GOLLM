RNA vaccines have demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in humans, and the 
technology is being leveraged for rapid emergency response. In this report, we 
assessed immunogenicity and, for the first time, toxicity, biodistribution, and 
protective efficacy in preclinical models of a two-dose self-amplifying 
messenger RNA (SAM) vaccine, encoding a prefusion-stabilized spike antigen of 
SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). In 
mice, one immunization with the SAM vaccine elicited a robust spike-specific 
antibody response, which was further boosted by a second immunization, and 
effectively neutralized the matched SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain as well as B.1.1.7 
(Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants. High frequencies of 
spike-specific germinal center B, Th0/Th1 CD4, and CD8 T cell responses were 
observed in mice. Local tolerance, potential systemic toxicity, and 
biodistribution of the vaccine were characterized in rats. In hamsters, the 
vaccine candidate was well-tolerated, markedly reduced viral load in the upper 
and lower airways, and protected animals against disease in a dose-dependent 
manner, with no evidence of disease enhancement following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. 
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 SAM (LNP) vaccine candidate has a favorable safety 
profile, elicits robust protective immune responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 
variants, and has been advanced to phase 1 clinical evaluation (NCT04758962).
