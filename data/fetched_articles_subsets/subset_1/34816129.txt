Recapitulating human NEC using animal models has been insightful in dissecting 
the signaling pathways, immune-mediated mechanisms, genetic signatures, and the 
intestinal architecture of NEC. This protocol describes an in vivo murine NEC 
model, using hypoxia and formula containing lipopolysaccharide and enteric 
bacteria derived from an infant with NEC. With this mouse model, we aim to 
further dissect NEC pathogenesis and develop new therapeutic strategies. For 
complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Mihi 
et al. (2021).
