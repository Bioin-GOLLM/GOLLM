Studies on diabetes have long been hampered by a lack of authentic disease 
models that, ideally, should be unlimited and able to recapitulate the 
abnormalities involved in the development, structure, and function of human 
pancreatic islets under pathological conditions. Stem cell-based islet organoids 
faithfully recapitulate islet development in vitro and provide large amounts of 
three-dimensional functional islet biomimetic materials with a morphological 
structure and cellular composition similar to those of native islets. Thus, 
islet organoids hold great promise for modeling islet development and function, 
deciphering the mechanisms underlying the onset of diabetes, providing an in 
vitro human organ model for infection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and 
contributing to drug screening and autologous islet transplantation. However, 
the currently established islet organoids are generally immature compared with 
native islets, and further efforts should be made to improve the heterogeneity 
and functionality of islet organoids, making it an authentic and informative 
disease model for diabetes. Here, we review the advances and challenges in the 
generation of islet organoids, focusing on human pluripotent stem cell-derived 
islet organoids, and the potential applications of islet organoids as disease 
models and regenerative therapies for diabetes.
