Genetic factors are an important cause of idiopathic sensorineural hearing 
impairment (SNHI). From the epidemiological perspective, mutations of three 
deafness genes: GJB2, SLC26A4, and MT-RNR1, are much more prevalent than those 
of other genes worldwide. However, mutation spectra of common deafness genes 
differ remarkably across different populations. Here, we performed comprehensive 
genetic examination and haplotype analyses in 188 unrelated Mongolian families 
with idiopathic SNHI, and compared their mutation spectra and haplotypes to 
those of other European and Asian cohorts. We confirmed genetic diagnoses in 18 
(9.6%) of the 188 families, including 13 with bi-allelic GJB2 mutations, three 
with bi-allelic SLC26A4 mutations, and two with homoplasmic MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G 
mutation. Moreover, mono-allelic mutations were identified in 17 families 
(9.0%), including 14 with mono-allelic GJB2 mutations and three with 
mono-allelic SLC26A4 mutations. Interestingly, three GJB2 mutations prevalent in 
other populations, including c.35delG in Caucasians, c.235delC in East Asians, 
and c.-23+1G>A in Southwest and South Asians, were simultaneously detected in 
Mongolian patients. Haplotype analyses further confirmed founder effects for 
each of the three mutations, indicating that each mutation derived from its 
ancestral origin independently. By demonstrating the unique spectra of 
deafness-associated mutations, our findings may have important clinical and 
scientific implications for refining the molecular diagnostics of SNHI in 
Mongolian patients, and for elucidating the genetic relationships among Eurasian 
populations.
