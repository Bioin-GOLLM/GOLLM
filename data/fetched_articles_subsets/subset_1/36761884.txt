INTRODUCTION: African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease of pigs 
and wild boar that poses a major threat to the global swine industry. The 
genotype II African swine fever virus (ASFV) entered the European Union (EU) in 
2014 and since then fourteen countries have been affected, Italy and North 
Macedonia being the last in 2022. While whole genome sequencing remains the gold 
standard for the identification of new genetic markers, sequencing of multiple 
loci with significant variations could be used as a rapid and cost-effective 
alternative to track outbreaks and study disease evolution in endemic areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To further our understanding of the epidemiology and 
spread of ASFV in Europe, 382 isolates collected during 2007 to 2022 were 
sequenced. The study was initially performed by sequencing the central variable 
region (CVR), the intergenic region (IGR) between the I73R and I329L genes and 
the O174L and K145R genes. For further discrimination, two new PCRs were 
designed to amplify the IGR between the 9R and 10R genes of the multigene family 
505 (MGF505) and the IGR between the I329L and I215L genes. The sequences 
obtained were compared with genotype II isolates from Europe and Asia.
RESULTS: The combination of the results obtained by sequencing these variable 
regions allowed to differentiate the European II-ASFV genotypes into 24 
different groups. In addition, the SNP identified in the IGR I329L-I215L region, 
not previously described, grouped the viruses from North Macedonia that caused 
the 2022 outbreaks with viruses from Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece, 
differentiating from other genotype II isolates present in Europe and Asia. 
Furthermore, tandem repeat sequence (TRS) within the 9R-10R genes of the 
multigene family 505 (MGF505) revealed eight different variants circulating.
DISCUSSION: These findings describe a new multi-gene approach sequencing method 
that can be used in routine genotyping to determine the origin of new 
introductions in ASF-free areas and track infection dynamics in endemic areas.
