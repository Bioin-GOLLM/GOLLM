A Turkish patient with C1q deficiency presented with a lupus-like disease, and a 
new missense mutation at A chain is presented. To characterize the genetic 
defect, all exons of the genes for the A, B, and C chains of C1q were sequenced 
in the patient. This revealed a missense mutation in the collagen-like domain of 
the A chain, p.Gly31 Arg. No other sequence variants, including the common 
silent mutations, were found in the three chains. Exon 1 of the C1q A chain was 
sequenced in 105 samples from healthy controls for this particular mutation. 
None of these carried the mutation. The C1q-deficient patient was treated with 
fresh frozen plasma infusions. Our findings showed that Turkish patients may 
have different mutations than the previously described common mutation, and once 
again, not only nonsense mutations but also missense mutations cause hereditary 
C1q deficiency. Regular fresh frozen plasma infusions to the patient have been 
clinically and therapeutically successful.
