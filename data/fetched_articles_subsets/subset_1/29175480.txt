Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is the constellation of metabolic risk factors that 
might foster development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
Abdominal obesity and insulin resistance play a prominent role among all 
metabolic traits of MetS. Because intervention including weight loss can reduce 
these morbidity and mortality in MetS, early detection of the severity and 
complications of MetS could be useful. Recent advances in imaging modalities 
have provided significant insight into the development and progression of 
abdominal obesity and insulin resistance, as well as target organ injuries. The 
purpose of this review is to summarize advances in diagnostic imaging modalities 
in MetS that can be applied for evaluating each components and target organs. 
This may help in early detection, monitoring target organ injury, and in turn 
developing novel therapeutic target to alleviate and avert them.
