The human pancreas, like almost all organs in the human body, is immunologically 
tolerated despite the presence of innate and adaptive immune cells that promptly 
mediate protective immune responses against pathogens in situ. The PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitory pathway seems to play a key role in the maintenance of immune 
tolerance systemically and within the pancreatic tissue. Tissue resident memory 
T cells (TRM), T regulatory cells (Treg), macrophages and even β cells exhibit 
PD-1 or PD-L1 expression that contributes in controlling pancreatic immune 
homeostasis and tolerance. Dysregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis as shown by 
animal studies and our recent experience with checkpoint inhibitory blockade in 
humans can lead to immune dysfunctions leading to chronic inflammatory disease 
and to type 1 diabetes (T1D) in genetically susceptible individuals. In this 
review, we discuss the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in pancreatic tissue 
homeostasis and tolerance, speculate how genetic and environmental factors can 
regulate the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, and discuss PD-1/PD-L1-based therapeutic 
approaches for pancreatic islet transplantation and T1D treatment.
