Choice of therapy for breast cancer relies on human epidermal growth factor 
receptor-2 (HER2) and estrogen receptor α (ER) status. Before randomization in 
the phase III Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation 
(ALTTO) trial for HER2-positive disease, HER2 and ER were centrally reviewed by 
Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, and Scottsdale, AZ) for North America and by the 
European Institute of Oncology (IEO; Milan, Italy) for the rest of world (except 
China). Discordance rates (local vs. central review) differed between Mayo and 
IEO. Among locally HER2-positive cases, 5.8 % (Mayo) and 14.5 % (IEO) were 
centrally HER2 negative. Among locally ER-positive cases, 16.2 % (Mayo) and 4.2 
% (IEO) were centrally ER-negative. Among locally ER-negative cases, 3.4 % 
(Mayo) and 21.4 % (IEO) were centrally ER-positive. We, therefore, performed a 
ring study to identify features contributing to these differing discordance 
rates. Mayo and IEO exchanged slides for 25 HER2 and 35 ER locally/centrally 
discordant cases. Both laboratories performed IHC and FISH for HER2 using the 
HercepTest(®) and PathVysion HER2 DNA probe kit/HER2/centromere 17 probe 
mixture. IHC for ER was tested centrally using the monoclonal ER 1D5 antibody 
(Mayo) or the DAKO cocktail of ER 1D5 and 2.123 antibodies (IEO). Mayo and IEO 
confirmed the central HER2-negative result in 100 % of 25 cases. Mayo and IEO 
confirmed the central ER result in 29 (85 %) of 34 evaluable cases. The five 
Mayo-negative/IEO-positive cases were ER-positive when retested at Mayo using 
the DAKO ER cocktail. In this ring study, ALTTO ineligibility did not change 
when HER2 testing was performed by either IEO or Mayo central laboratories. 
However, a dual antibody ER assay had fewer false-negative test results than an 
assay with a single antibody, and there was more discordance between the two ER 
reagents than has been previously reported. Using even slightly different assay 
methods yielded different results, even between experienced central 
laboratories.
