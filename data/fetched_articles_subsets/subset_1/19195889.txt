In a search for nonpeptide agonists for the neurotensin receptor (NTR1), we 
replaced the adamantyl amino acid moiety found in the antagonist SR48692 (1a) 
with leucine and related alpha-alkylamino acids found in peptide agonists. When 
tested in a calcium mobilization assay, we found that both d- and l-leucine 
confer partial agonist activity to the pyrazole scaffold with the l-enantiomer 
(3a) providing a significantly greater response. A brief SAR survey demonstrated 
that the observed agonist activity was resilient to changes made to the 
dimethoxyaryl ring in 3a. The resulting compounds were less potent relative to 
3a but showed greater agonist responses. The partial agonist activity was 
extinguished when the chloroquinoline ring was replaced with naphthalene. Thus, 
while l-leucine appears to possess a powerful agonist directing affect for the 
NTR1 receptor, its presence alone in the molecular architecture is not 
sufficient to insure agonist behavior.
