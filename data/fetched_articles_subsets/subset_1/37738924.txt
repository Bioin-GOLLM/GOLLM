Toxoplasmosis is a major infectious disease, affecting approximately one-third 
of the world's population; its main clinical manifestation, ocular toxoplasmosis 
(OT), is a severe sight-threatening disease. Nevertheless, the diagnosis of OT 
is based on clinical findings, which needs improvement, even with biochemical 
tests, such as polymerase chain reaction and antibody detections. Furthermore, 
the efficacy of OT-targeted treatment is limited; thus, additional measures for 
diagnosis and treatments are needed. Here, we for the first time report a 
significantly reduced iron concentration in the vitreous humor (VH) of human 
patients infected with OT. To obtain further insights into molecular mechanisms, 
we established a mouse model of T. gondii infection, in which intravitreally 
injected tracer 57Fe, was accumulated in the neurosensory retina. T. 
gondii-infected eyes showed increased lipid peroxidation, reduction of 
glutathione peroxidase-4 expression and mitochondrial deformity in the 
photoreceptor as cristae loss. These findings strongly suggest the involvement 
of ferroptotic process in the photoreceptor of OT. In addition, deferiprone, an 
FDA-approved iron chelator, reduced the iron uptake but also ameliorated 
toxoplasma-induced retinochoroiditis by reducing retinal inflammation. In 
conclusion, the iron levels in the VH could serve as diagnostic markers and iron 
chelators as potential treatments for OT.
