Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have 
not been effective in unselected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) 
populations. We previously reported an exceptional response to a brief course of 
erlotinib in a patient with advanced HNSCC whose tumor harbored a MAPK1E322K 
somatic mutation. MAPK1E322Kwas associated with increased p-EGFR, increased EGFR 
downstream signaling and increased sensitivity to erlotinib. In this study, we 
investigated the mechanism of MAPK1E322K-mediated EGFR activation in the context 
of erlotinib sensitivity. We demonstrated increased AREG secretion in HNSCC cell 
lines harboring endogenous or exogenous MAPK1E322K compared to wild type MAPK1. 
We found inhibition or knockdown of MAPK1 with siRNA resulted in reduced 
secretion of AREG and decreased sensitivity to erlotinib in the setting of 
MAPK1E322K. MAPK1E322K was associated with increased AREG secretion leading to 
an autocrine feedback loop involving AREG, EGFR and downstream signaling. 
Knockdown of AREG in HNSCC cells harboring MAPK1E322K abrogated EGFR signaling 
and decreased sensitivity to erlotinib in vitro and in vivo. These cumulative 
findings implicate increased AREG secretion and EGFR activation as contributing 
to increased erlotinib sensitivity in MAPK1E322K HNSCC.
