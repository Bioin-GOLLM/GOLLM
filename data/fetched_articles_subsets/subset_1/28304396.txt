mRNA splicing is an important mechanism to regulate mRNA expression. Abnormal 
regulation of this process may lead to lung cancer. Here, we investigated the 
associations of 11,966 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 206 mRNA 
splicing-related genes with lung cancer risk by using the summary data from six 
published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of Transdisciplinary Research 
in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) (12,160 cases and 16,838 controls) and another two 
lung cancer GWASs of Harvard University (984 cases and 970 controls) and deCODE 
(1,319 cases and 26,380 controls). We found that a total of 12 significant SNPs 
with false discovery rate (FDR) ≤0.05 were mapped to one novel gene PRPF6 and 
two previously reported genes (DHX16 and LSM2) that were also confirmed in this 
study. The six novel SNPs in PRPF6 were in high linkage disequilibrium and 
associated with PRPF6 mRNA expression in lymphoblastoid cells from 373 Europeans 
in the 1000 Genomes Project. Taken together, our studies shed new light on the 
role of mRNA splicing genes in the development of lung cancer.
