Molecular epidemiology is a subdivision of medical science and epidemiology that 
emphases on the involvement of potential environmental and genetic risk factors, 
recognized at the molecular level, to the etiology and avoidance of sickness 
through populations. This arena has developed from the combination of molecular 
biology and traditional epidemiological research. Molecular epidemiology can 
improve our knowledge about the precise pathogenesis of disease through 
recognizing particular pathways that affect the risk of developing the disease. 
Furthermore, it tries to find how the collaborations between genetic 
characteristics and environmental exposures works in disease occurrence.
