Histone acetylations are important epigenetic markers for transcriptional 
activation in response to metabolic changes and various stresses. Using the 
high-throughput SEquencing-Based Yeast replicative Lifespan screen method and 
the yeast knockout collection, we demonstrate that the HDA complex, a class-II 
histone deacetylase (HDAC), regulates aging through its target of acetylated 
H3K18 at storage carbohydrate genes. We find that, in addition to longer 
lifespan, disruption of HDA results in resistance to DNA damage and osmotic 
stresses. We show that these effects are due to increased promoter H3K18 
acetylation and transcriptional activation in the trehalose metabolic pathway in 
the absence of HDA. Furthermore, we determine that the longevity effect of HDA 
is independent of the Cyc8-Tup1 repressor complex known to interact with HDA and 
coordinate transcriptional repression. Silencing the HDA homologs in C. elegans 
and Drosophila increases their lifespan and delays aging-associated physical 
declines in adult flies. Hence, we demonstrate that this HDAC controls an 
evolutionarily conserved longevity pathway.
