Synaptic plasticity is a cardinal cellular mechanism for learning and memory. 
The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has emerged as a pivotal pathway for synaptic 
plasticity because of its widely characterized ability to depress synaptic 
transmission on short- and long-term scales. Recent reports indicate that eCBs 
also mediate potentiation of the synapse. However, it is not known how eCB 
signaling may support bidirectionality. Here, we combined electrophysiology 
experiments with mathematical modeling to question the mechanisms of eCB 
bidirectionality in spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at corticostriatal 
synapses. We demonstrate that STDP outcome is controlled by eCB levels and 
dynamics: prolonged and moderate levels of eCB lead to eCB-mediated long-term 
depression (eCB-tLTD) while short and large eCB transients produce eCB-mediated 
long-term potentiation (eCB-tLTP). Moreover, we show that eCB-tLTD requires 
active calcineurin whereas eCB-tLTP necessitates the activity of presynaptic 
PKA. Therefore, just like glutamate or GABA, eCB form a bidirectional system to 
encode learning and memory.
