Six new zinc(II) complexes were prepared by the reaction of ZnBr2 or ZnI2 with 
4'-(substituted-phenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine compounds, bearing 
p-methylsulfonyl (L1), p-methoxy (L2) and p-methyl (L3), which were 
characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR and single crystal X-ray 
diffraction. The antiproliferative properties against Eca-109, A549 and Bel-7402 
cell lines and the cytotoxicity test on RAW-264.7 of these compounds were 
monitored using a CCK-8 assay, and the studies indicate that the complexes show 
higher antiproliferative activities than cisplatin. The interactions of these 
complexes with CT-DNA and proteins (BSA) were studied by UV-Vis, circular 
dichroism (CD) and fluorescent spectroscopy, respectively. The results indicate 
that the interaction of these zinc(II) complexes with CT-DNA is achieved through 
intercalative binding, and their strong binding affinity to BSA is fulfilled 
through a static quenching mechanism. The simulation of the complexes with the 
CT-DNA fragment and BSA was studied by using molecular docking software. It 
further validates that the complexes interact with DNA through intercalative 
binding mode and that they have a strong interaction with BSA.
