Toxoplasma gondii is among the most prevalent parasites worldwide, infecting 
many wild and domestic animals and causing zoonotic infections in humans. T. 
gondii differs substantially in its broad distribution from closely related 
parasites that typically have narrow, specialized host ranges. To elucidate the 
genetic basis for these differences, we compared the genomes of 62 globally 
distributed T. gondii isolates to several closely related coccidian parasites. 
Our findings reveal that tandem amplification and diversification of secretory 
pathogenesis determinants is the primary feature that distinguishes the closely 
related genomes of these biologically diverse parasites. We further show that 
the unusual population structure of T. gondii is characterized by clade-specific 
inheritance of large conserved haploblocks that are significantly enriched in 
tandemly clustered secretory pathogenesis determinants. The shared inheritance 
of these conserved haploblocks, which show a different ancestry than the genome 
as a whole, may thus influence transmission, host range and pathogenicity.
