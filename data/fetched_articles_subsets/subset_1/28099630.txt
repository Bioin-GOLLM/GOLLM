OBJECTIVE: Memory impairment is an important contributor to the reduction in 
quality of life experienced by older adults, and genetic risk factors seem to 
contribute to variance in age-related cognitive decline. Brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important nerve growth factor linked with 
development and neural plasticity. The Val66Met polymorphism in the BDNF gene 
has been associated with impaired episodic memory in adults, but whether this 
functional variant plays a role in cognitive aging remains unclear. The purpose 
of this study was to investigate the effects of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism 
on memory performance in a sample of elderly adults.
METHODS: Eighty-seven subjects aged > 55 years were recruited using a 
community-based convenience sampling strategy in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The 
logical memory subset of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised was used to assess 
immediate verbal recall (IVR), delayed verbal recall (DVR), and memory retention 
rate.
RESULTS: BDNF Met allele carriers had lower DVR scores (p = 0.004) and a decline 
in memory retention (p = 0.017) when compared to Val/Val homozygotes. However, 
we found no significant differences in IVR between the two groups (p = 0.088).
CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis of the BDNF Val66Met 
polymorphism as a risk factor associated with cognitive impairment, 
corroborating previous findings in young and older adults.
