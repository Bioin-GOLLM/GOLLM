BACKGROUND: Serum amyloid A (SAA) is secreted by liver hepatocytes in response 
to increased inflammation whereupon it associates with high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) and alters the protein and lipid composition of HDL negating some of its 
anti-atherogenic properties.
AIMS: To identify variants within the SAA gene that may be associated with SAA 
levels and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We identified exonic variants within the SAA genes by deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) Sanger sequencing. We tested the association between SAA variants and 
serum SAA levels in 246 individuals with and without CVD.
RESULTS: Increased SAA was associated with rs2468844 (beta [β] = 1.73; 
confidence intervals [CI], 1.14-1.75; p = 0.01), rs1136747 (β = 1.53 (CI, 
1.11-1.73); p = 0.01) and rs149926073 (β = 3.37 (CI, 1.70-4.00); p = 0.02), 
while rs1136745 was significantly associated with decreased SAA levels (β = 0.70 
(CI, 0.53-0.94); p = 0.02). Homozygous individuals with the SAA1.3 haplotype had 
significantly lower levels of SAA compared with those with SAA1.1 or SAA1.5 
(β = 0.43 (CI, 0.22-0.85); p = 0.02) while SAA1.3/1.5 heterozygotes had 
significantly higher SAA levels compared with those homozygous for SAA1.1 
(β = 2.58 (CI, 1.19-5.57); p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified novel genetic variants in the SAA genes 
associated with SAA levels, a biomarker of inflammation and chronic disease. The 
utility of SAA as a biomarker for inflammation and chronic disease may be 
influenced by underlying genetic variation in baseline levels.
