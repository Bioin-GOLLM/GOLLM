Melanin pigment helps protect our body from broad wavelength solar radiation and 
skin cancer. Among other pigmentation disorders in humans, albinism is reported 
to manifest in both syndromic and nonsyndromic forms as well as with varying 
inheritance patterns. Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), an autosomal recessive 
nonsyndromic form of albinism, presents as partial to complete loss of melanin 
in the skin, hair, and iris. OCA has been known to be caused by pathogenic 
variants in seven different genes, so far, according to all the currently 
published population studies. However, the detection rate of alleles causing OCA 
varies from 50% to 90%. One of the significant challenges of uncovering the 
pathological variant underlying disease etiology is inter- and intra-familial 
locus heterogeneity. This problem is especially pertinent in highly inbred 
populations. As examples of such familial locus heterogeneity, we present nine 
consanguineous Pakistani families with segregating OCA due to variants in one or 
two different known albinism-associated genes. All of the identified variants 
are predicted to be pathogenic, which was corroborated by several in silico 
algorithms and association with diverse clinical phenotypes. We report an 
individual affected with OCA carries heterozygous, likely pathogenic variants in 
TYR and OCA2, raising the question of a possible digenic inheritance. 
Altogether, our study highlights the significance of exome sequencing for the 
complete genetic diagnosis of inbred families and provides the ramifications of 
potential genetic interaction and digenic inheritance of variants in the TYR and 
OCA2 genes.
