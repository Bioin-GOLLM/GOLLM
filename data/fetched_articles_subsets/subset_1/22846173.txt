BACKGROUND: HIV-1-infected patients can be superinfected with additional HIV-1 
variants. Therapy failure can be the consequence of an infection with a 
resistant strain.
METHODS: A patient was diagnosed with a recent HIV-1 infection in April 2005 and 
subsequently clinically monitored. HIV-1 evolution was studied by population 
sequencing of the first 984 bases of the pol gene as well as 454 ultra-deep 
pyrosequencing (UDPS) of parts of the pol and env genes.
RESULTS: The patient was diagnosed with a wild-type HIV-1 strain, but 
experienced rapid virological failure after initiating a non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based treatment regimen 3 years later. 
Population sequencing and UDPS revealed the presence of a second HIV-1 strain 
with a Y188L NNRTI resistance mutation in a sample obtained shortly prior to 
initiation of therapy. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the two HIV-1 strains 
were genetically distinct, providing evidence for superinfection.
CONCLUSIONS: The virological treatment failure in this patient was probably due 
to the superinfection with an NNRTI-resistant HIV-1 variant. Superinfection with 
drug-resistant strains can undermine HIV-1 treatment regimens selected on the 
basis of resistance testing at diagnosis. Patients, especially in high-risk 
groups, as well as their clinicians, should be aware of the risks and dangers of 
superinfections.
