BACKGROUND: Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) play a pivotal role in lung tumor 
formation and progression. Nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin1, Ninj1) has 
been implicated in lung cancer; however, the pathological role of Ninj1 in the 
context of lung tumorigenesis remains largely unknown.
METHODS: The role of Ninj1 in the survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
CSCs within microenvironments exhibiting hazardous conditions was assessed by 
utilizing patient tissues and transgenic mouse models where Ninj1 repression and 
oncogenic KrasG12D/+ or carcinogen-induced genetic changes were induced in 
putative pulmonary stem cells (SCs). Additionally, NSCLC cell lines and primary 
cultures of patient-derived tumors, particularly Ninj1high and Ninj1low 
subpopulations and those with gain- or loss-of-Ninj1 expression, and also 
publicly available data were all used to assess the role of Ninj1 in lung 
tumorigenesis.
RESULTS: Ninj1 expression is elevated in various human NSCLC cell lines and 
tumors, and elevated expression of this protein can serve as a biomarker for 
poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Elevated Ninj1 expression in pulmonary 
SCs with oncogenic changes promotes lung tumor growth in mice. Ninj1high 
subpopulations within NSCLC cell lines, patient-derived tumors, and NSCLC cells 
with gain-of-Ninj1 expression exhibited CSC-associated phenotypes and 
significantly enhanced survival capacities in vitro and in vivo in the presence 
of various cell death inducers. Mechanistically, Ninj1 forms an assembly with 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) through its extracellular 
N-terminal domain and recruits Frizzled2 (FZD2) and various downstream signaling 
mediators, ultimately resulting in transcriptional upregulation of target genes 
of the LRP6/β-catenin signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Ninj1 may act as a driver of lung tumor formation and progression 
by protecting NSCLC CSCs from hostile microenvironments through 
ligand-independent activation of LRP6/β-catenin signaling.
