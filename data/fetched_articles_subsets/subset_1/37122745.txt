Cytoplasmic DNA is emerging as a pivotal contributor to the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory diseases and cancer, such as COVID-19 and lung carcinoma. However, 
the complexity of various cytoplasmic DNA-related pathways and their crosstalk 
remains challenging to distinguish their specific roles in many distinct 
inflammatory diseases, especially for the underlying mechanisms. Here, we 
reviewed the latest findings on cytoplasmic DNA and its signaling pathways in 
inflammatory lung conditions and lung cancer progression. We found that 
sustained activation of cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathways contributes to the 
development of common lung diseases, which may result from external factors or 
mutations of key genes in the organism. We further discussed the interplays 
between cytoplasmic DNA and anti-inflammatory or anti-tumor effects for 
potential immunotherapy. In sum, this review aids in understanding the roles of 
cytoplasmic DNAs and exploring more therapeutic strategies.
