BACKGROUND: Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder 
characterised by non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, cranial 
diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness. Some reports have described 
hypogonadism in male WS patients. The aim of our study was to find out whether 
Wfs1 deficient (Wfs1KO) male mice have reduced fertility and, if so, to examine 
possible causes.
METHODS: Wfs1KO mice were generated by homologous recombination. Both Wfs1KO and 
wild type (wt) male mice were mated with wt female mice. The number of litters 
and the number of pups were counted and pregnancy rates calculated. The motility 
and morphology of the sperm and the histology of testes were analysed. Serum 
testosterone and FSH concentrations were also measured.
RESULTS: The pregnancy rate in wt females mated with Wfs1KO males was 
significantly lower than in the control group (15% vs. 32%; p < 0.05), but there 
was no significant difference in litter size. Analysis of male fertility showed 
that, in the Wfs1KO group, eight males out of 13 had pups whereas in the control 
group all 13 males had at least one litter. Sperm motility was not affected in 
Wfs1KO mice, but Wfs1KO males had less proximal bent tails (14.4 +/- 1.2% vs. 
21.5 +/- 1.3 p < 0.05) and less abnormal sperm heads (22.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 31.5 +/- 
3.5, p < 0.05) than wt males. Testes histology revealed significantly reduced 
number of spermatogonia (23.9 +/- 4.9 vs. 38.1 +/- 2.8; p < 0.05) and Sertoli 
cells (6.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.0; p < 0.05) in Wfs1KO mice. Serum testosterone 
and FSH concentrations did not differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The impaired fertility of Wfs1KO male mice is most likely due to 
changes in sperm morphology and reduced number of spermatogenic cells. The exact 
mechanism through which the Wfs1 gene influences sperm morphology needs to be 
clarified in further studies.
