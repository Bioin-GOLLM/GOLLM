Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is an inflammation-inducible adhesion 
molecule, which supports contact between leukocytes and inflamed endothelium. 
There is evidence that VAP-1 is involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to 
melanoma tumors. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based immunotherapy is an efficient 
therapy that promotes immune system activity against cancers but is associated 
with toxicity. In the present study, we evaluated the feasibility of PET/CT 
imaging using the radiotracer [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9, which is targeted to 
VAP-1, to monitor pharmacodynamic effects of a novel FAP-IL2v immunocytokine (a 
genetically engineered variant of IL-2 fused with fibroblast activation protein) 
in the B16-FAP melanoma model. At 9 days after the inoculation of B16-FAP 
melanoma cells, mice were studied with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT as a 
baseline measurement. Immediately after baseline imaging, mice were treated with 
FAP-IL2v or vehicle, and treatment was repeated 3 days later. Subsequent PET/CT 
imaging was performed 3, 5, and 7 days after baseline imaging. In addition to in 
vivo PET imaging, ex vivo autoradiography, histology, and immunofluorescence 
staining were performed on excised tumors. B16-FAP tumors were clearly detected 
with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 PET/CT during the follow-up period, without 
differences in tumor volume between FAP-IL2v-treated and vehicle-treated groups. 
Tumor-to-muscle uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 was significantly higher in the 
FAP-IL2v-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group 7 days after baseline 
imaging, and this was confirmed by tumor autoradiography analysis. FAP-IL2v 
treatment did not affect VAP-1 expression on the tumor vasculature. However, 
FAP-IL2v treatment increased the number of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells 
in tumors. The present study showed that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 can detect 
B16-FAP tumors and allows monitoring of FAP-IL2v treatment.
