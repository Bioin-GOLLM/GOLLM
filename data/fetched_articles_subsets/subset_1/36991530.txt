BACKGROUND: The addition of cryobiopsy to conventional biopsy methods improves 
the diagnostic yield of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Moreover, cryobiopsy with 
a guide sheath (GS) provides additional diagnostic benefits. Semi-real-time 
biopsy can be repeatedly performed using conventional biopsy devices and a GS, 
and subsequent cryobiopsy can be easily performed at the same location. 
Recently, a disposable 1.1 mm-diameter ultrathin cryoprobe has been developed 
and can be used with a 1.95 mm GS in a 2.0 mm working channel. In this study, we 
evaluated the diagnostic performance of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) 
with the 1.1 mm cryoprobe and a GS in patients with peripheral pulmonary 
lesions.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who 
underwent endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial lung biopsy with a guide 
sheath and TBLC from July 23, 2021 to April 30, 2022 at Chungnam National 
University Hospital.
RESULTS: Of a consecutive series of 229 patients, 199 were included. The 
diagnostic yields of forceps biopsy and cryobiopsy were 65.3% (130/199) and 
84.4% (168/199), respectively, and the total diagnostic yield was 91.5% 
(182/199) ( P <0.001 vs. forceps biopsy). Multivariate analysis showed that 
solid lesion morphology [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.659, P =0.002] was 
associated with a significantly greater diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy, whereas 
a lesion diameter >20 mm ( P =0.026; adjusted OR 3.816) and 'within' orientation 
( P =0.004; adjusted OR 6.174) were associated with a significantly greater 
overall diagnostic yield.
CONCLUSION: TBLC using an ultrathin cryoprobe and GS markedly improves the 
diagnostic yield.
