Legius Syndrome and its Relationship with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.

Denayer E, Legius E.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common disorder characterized by 
multiple café-au-lait macules. Most individuals with this autosomal dominant 
disorder also have other features, such as skinfold freckling, iris Lisch 
nodules and benign or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. Legius syndrome 
is a less frequent autosomal dominant disorder with similar multiple 
café-au-lait macules and skinfold freckling. Legius syndrome is not 
characterized by an increased risk of tumours, and a correct diagnosis is 
important. In young children with a sporadic form of multiple café-au-lait 
macules with or without freckling and no other manifestations of NF1 these 2 
conditions cannot be differentiated based on clinical examination. Molecular 
analysis of the NF1 and SPRED1 genes is usually needed to differentiate the 2 
conditions. Other less frequent conditions with café-au-lait macules are Noonan 
syndrome with multiple lentigines, constitutional mismatch repair deficiency and 
McCune-Albright syndrome.
