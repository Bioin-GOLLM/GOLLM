OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus (DM) has several complications. Delayed wound 
healing, microvascular disease and an impaired response to infections are 
complications that can have a direct bearing on dental implant therapy. This 
paper studies the awareness of the population with regard to the effect of DM on 
dental implant treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated, close-ended questionnaire was distributed to 
506 randomly selected mall-goers in the city of Jeddah. Responses were coded and 
entered into spreadsheet software (SPSS, IBM). The frequency distribution of the 
responses was calculated, and inferences were drawn.
RESULTS: The study revealed that the majority of the sample were females 
(62.8%), did not have diabetes (80.4%) and reported a positive family history of 
diabetes (87.4%). Most of the respondents (56%) believed that uncontrolled 
diabetes can lead to implant loss and that diabetes affects the healing process 
(91.6%). Many patients (42%) responded that diabetes could be treated with 
dental implants if the blood sugar level was controlled.
CONCLUSION: The studied sample revealed a satisfactory level of awareness 
regarding the association of diabetes and oral hygiene in dental implant 
therapy. However, there is less than adequate knowledge about the effects of 
diabetes on dental implants, as the majority of the respondents believe that 
only controlled diabetics can avail dental implant treatment.
