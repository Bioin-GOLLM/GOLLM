BACKGROUND: Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), commonly known as monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
many diseases characterized by monocytic infiltration. However, limited data 
have been reported on MCP-1 in type 1 diabetes (T1D) and the findings are 
inconclusive and inconsistent.
METHODS: In this study, MCP-1 was measured in the sera from 2,472 T1D patients 
and 2,654 healthy controls using a Luminex assay. The rs1024611 SNP in the 
promoter region of MCP-1 was genotyped for a subset of subjects (1764 T1D 
patients and 1323 controls) using the TaqMan-assay.
RESULTS: Subject age, sex or genotypes of MCP-1 rs1024611SNP did not have a 
major impact on serum MCP-1 levels in either healthy controls or patients. While 
hemoglobin A1c levels did not have a major influence on serum MCP-1 levels, the 
mean serum MCP-1 levels are significantly higher in patients with multiple 
complications (mean = 242 ng/ml) compared to patients without any complications 
(mean = 201 ng/ml) (p = 3.5×10(-6)). Furthermore, mean serum MCP-1 is higher in 
controls (mean = 261 ng/ml) than T1D patients (mean = 208 ng/ml) (p<10(-23)). 
More importantly, the frequency of subjects with extremely high levels (>99(th) 
percentile of patients or 955 ng/ml) of serum MCP-1 is significantly lower in 
the T1D group compared to the control group (odds ratio = 0.11, p<10(-33)).
CONCLUSION: MCP-1 may have a dual role in T1D and its complications. While very 
high levels of serum MCP-1 may be protective against the development of T1D, 
complications are associated with higher serum MCP-1 levels within the T1D 
group.
