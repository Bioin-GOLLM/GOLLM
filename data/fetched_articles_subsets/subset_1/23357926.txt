BACKGROUND: There are limited studies on the role of interaction between 
exposure to ambient air pollution and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) P1 on the 
risk of asthma/wheezing among children, which provided suggestive, but 
inconclusive results.
METHODS: To assess the joint effect of air pollutants and GSTP1 on 
asthma/wheezing, we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional study of 3,825 
children in Taiwan Children Health Study. The studied determinants were three 
GSTP1 Ile105Val (rs 1695) genotypes (Ile-Ile; Ile-Val and Val-Val) and expoure 
to ambient air pollutants. We used routine air-pollution monitoring data for 
ozone (O(3)) and particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 Âµm or less 
(PM(2.5)). The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (ORs) per 
interquartile changes for PM(2.5) and O(3).
FINDINGS: In a two-stage hierarchical model adjusting for confounding, the risk 
of asthma was negatively associated with PM(2.5) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.60; 
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45, 0.82) and O(3) (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.60, 0.90) 
among Ile105 homozygotes, but positively associated with PM(2.5) (OR 1.52; 95% 
CI 1.01, 2.27) and O(3) (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.91, 1.57) among those with at least 
one val105 allele (interaction p value = 0.001 and 0.03, respectively). A 
similar tendency of effect modification between PM(2.5) and O(3) and GSTP1 on 
wheezing was found.
CONCLUSION: Children who carried Ile105 variant allele and exposed to PM(2.5) 
and O(3) may be less likely to occurrence of asthma/wheezing.
