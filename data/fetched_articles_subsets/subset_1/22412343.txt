This paper presents two scheduling management schemes for wireless sensor 
networks, which manage the sensors by utilizing the hierarchical network 
structure and allocate network resources efficiently. A local criterion is used 
to simultaneously establish the sensing coverage and connectivity such that 
dynamic cluster-based sleep scheduling can be achieved. The proposed schemes are 
simulated and analyzed to abstract the network behaviors in a number of 
settings. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms provide 
efficient network power control and can achieve high scalability in wireless 
sensor networks.
