The origins of giraffe's imposing stature and associated cardiovascular 
adaptations are unknown. Okapi, which lacks these unique features, is giraffe's 
closest relative and provides a useful comparison, to identify genetic variation 
underlying giraffe's long neck and cardiovascular system. The genomes of giraffe 
and okapi were sequenced, and through comparative analyses genes and pathways 
were identified that exhibit unique genetic changes and likely contribute to 
giraffe's unique features. Some of these genes are in the HOX, NOTCH and FGF 
signalling pathways, which regulate both skeletal and cardiovascular 
development, suggesting that giraffe's stature and cardiovascular adaptations 
evolved in parallel through changes in a small number of genes. Mitochondrial 
metabolism and volatile fatty acids transport genes are also evolutionarily 
diverged in giraffe and may be related to its unusual diet that includes toxic 
plants. Unexpectedly, substantial evolutionary changes have occurred in giraffe 
and okapi in double-strand break repair and centrosome functions.
