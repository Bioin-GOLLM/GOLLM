Penalized likelihood methods are fundamental to ultra-high dimensional variable 
selection. How high dimensionality such methods can handle remains largely 
unknown. In this paper, we show that in the context of generalized linear 
models, such methods possess model selection consistency with oracle properties 
even for dimensionality of Non-Polynomial (NP) order of sample size, for a class 
of penalized likelihood approaches using folded-concave penalty functions, which 
were introduced to ameliorate the bias problems of convex penalty functions. 
This fills a long-standing gap in the literature where the dimensionality is 
allowed to grow slowly with the sample size. Our results are also applicable to 
penalized likelihood with the L(1)-penalty, which is a convex function at the 
boundary of the class of folded-concave penalty functions under consideration. 
The coordinate optimization is implemented for finding the solution paths, whose 
performance is evaluated by a few simulation examples and the real data 
analysis.
