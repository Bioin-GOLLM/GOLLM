A new series of trimethoprim (TMP) analogs containing amide bonds (1-6) have 
been synthesized. Molecular docking, as well as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 
inhibition assay were used to confirm their affinity to bind dihydrofolate 
reductase enzyme. Data from the ethidium displacement test showed their 
DNA-binding capacity. Tests confirming the possibility of DNA binding in a minor 
groove as well as determination of the association constants were performed 
using calf thymus DNA, T4 coliphage DNA, poly (dA-dT)2 and poly (dG-dC)2. 
Additionally, the mechanism of action of the new compounds was studied. In 
conclusion, some of our new analogs inhibited DHFR activity more strongly than 
TMP did, which confirms, that the addition of amide bonds into the analogs of 
TMP increases their affinity towards DHFR.
