Immunocompetent, but not RAG1(-/-) mice infected with MHV-JHM develop 
demyelination. Transferred CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes reconstitute 
demyelination, and this ability is dependent on donor IFN-gamma. We used 
IFN-gammaR1(-/-) mice to examine the target of IFN-gamma in CD8 T cell-mediated 
demyelination. In IFN-gammaR1(-/-)RAG1(-/-) recipients, demyelination is 
decreased, but not eliminated, while viral titers are significantly increased 
when compared to IFN-gammaR1(+/+)RAG1(-/-) recipients. IFN-gammaR1(-/-) CD8 T 
cells retain virus-specific effector function regardless of IFN-gammaR1 
expression. Although IFN-gammaR1 responsiveness is critical for maximal 
demyelination, increased levels of infectious virus coupled with adoptive 
transfer of CD8 T cells may result in myelin destruction independent of 
IFN-gammaR1 expression.
