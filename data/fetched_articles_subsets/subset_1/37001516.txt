Genomic imprinting underlies the mammalian requirement for sexual reproduction. 
Nonetheless, the relative contribution of the two parental genomes during human 
development is not fully understood. Specifically, a fascinating question is 
whether the formation of the gonad, which holds the ability to reproduce, 
depends on equal contribution from both parental genomes. Here, we 
differentiated androgenetic and parthenogenetic human pluripotent stem cells 
(hPSCs) into ovarian granulosa-like cells (GLCs). We show that in contrast to 
biparental and androgenetic cells, parthenogenetic hPSCs present a reduced 
capacity to differentiate into GLCs. We further identify the paternally 
expressed gene IGF2 as the most upregulated imprinted gene upon differentiation. 
Remarkably, while IGF2 knockout androgenetic cells fail to differentiate into 
GLCs, the differentiation of parthenogenetic cells supplemented with IGF2 is 
partly rescued. Thus, our findings unravel a surprising essentiality of genes 
that are only expressed from the paternal genome to the development of the 
female reproductive system.
