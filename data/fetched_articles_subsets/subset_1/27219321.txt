BACKGROUND: Although many studies have analyzed the association of 
3'-untranslated region variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in 
SLC6A3 with alcohol dependence (AD), the results remain controversial. This 
study aimed to determine whether this variant indeed has any genetic effect on 
AD by integrating 17 reported studies with 5,929 participants included.
METHODS: The A9-dominant genetic model that considers A9-repeat and non-A9 
repeat as 2 genotypes and compared their frequencies in alcoholics with that in 
controls was adopted. Considering the potential influence of ethnicity, 
differences in diagnostic criteria of AD, and alcoholic subgroups, stratified 
meta-analyses were conducted. There existed no evidence for the presence of 
heterogeneity among the studied samples, indicating the results under the 
fixed-effects model are acceptable.
RESULTS: We found a significant association of VNTR A9 genotypes with AD in all 
ethnic populations (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.00, 1.25; p = 0.045) and the Caucasian population (pooled OR 1.15; 95% CI 
1.01, 1.31; p = 0.036). We also found VNTR A9 genotypes to be significantly 
associated with alcoholism as defined by the DSM-IV criteria (pooled OR 1.18; 
95% CI 1.03, 1.36; p = 0.02). Further, we found a significant association 
between VNTR A9 genotypes and alcoholism associated with alcohol withdrawal 
seizure or delirium tremens (pooled OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.24, 1.92; p = 1.0 × 10(-4) 
). In all these meta-analyses, no evidence of publication bias was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the VNTR polymorphism has an important role in 
the etiology of AD, and individuals with at least 1 A9 allele are more likely to 
be dependent on alcohol than persons carrying the non-A9 allele.
