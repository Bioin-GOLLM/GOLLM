The 5-year survival rate for children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) has improved to more than 90% in high-income countries. However, 
further increases in the intensity of conventional chemotherapy would be 
associated with significant adverse effects; therefore, novel approaches are 
necessary. The last decade has seen significant advances in targeted therapy 
with immunotherapy and molecular therapeutics, as well as advances in risk 
stratification for therapy based on somatic and germline genetic analysis and 
monitoring of minimal residual disease. For immunotherapy, the approval of 
antibody-based therapy (with blinatumomab in 2014 and inotuzumab ozogamicin in 
2017) and T cell-based therapy (with tisagenlecleucel in 2017) by the US Food 
and Drug Administration has significantly improved the response rate and 
outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. These strategies have also 
been tested in the frontline setting, and immunotherapy against a new 
ALL-associated antigen has been developed. Incorporating effective immunotherapy 
into ALL therapy would enable the intensity of conventional chemotherapy to be 
decreased and thereby reduce associated toxicity, leading to further improvement 
in survival and quality of life for patients with ALL.
