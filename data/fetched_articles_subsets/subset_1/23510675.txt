The Marburg viruses Musoke (MARV-Mus) and Angola (MARV-Ang) have highly similar 
genomic sequences. Analysis of viral replication using various assays 
consistently identified MARV-Ang as the faster replicating virus. Non-coding 
genomic regions of negative sense RNA viruses are known to play a role in viral 
gene expression. A comparison of the six non-coding regions using bicistronic 
minigenomes revealed that the first two non-coding regions (NP/VP35 and 
VP35/VP40) differed significantly in their transcriptional regulation. Deletion 
mutation analysis of the MARV-Mus NP/VP35 region further revealed that the MARV 
polymerase (L) is able to initiate production of the downstream gene without the 
presence of highly conserved regulatory signals. Bicistronic minigenome assays 
also identified the VP30 mRNA 5' untranslated region as an rZAP-targeted RNA 
motif. Overall, our studies indicate that the high variation of MARV non-coding 
regions may play a significant role in observed differences in transcription 
and/or replication.
