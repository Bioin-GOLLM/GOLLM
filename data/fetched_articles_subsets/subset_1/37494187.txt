Viruses acquire host genes via horizontal transfer and can express them to 
manipulate host biology during infections. Some homologs retain sequence 
identity, but evolutionary divergence can obscure host origins. We use 
structural modeling to compare vaccinia virus proteins with metazoan proteomes. 
We identify vaccinia A47L as a homolog of gasdermins, the executioners of 
pyroptosis. An X-ray crystal structure of A47 confirms this homology, and 
cell-based assays reveal that A47 interferes with caspase function. We also 
identify vaccinia C1L as the product of a cryptic gene fusion event coupling a 
Bcl-2-related fold with a pyrin domain. C1 associates with components of the 
inflammasome, a cytosolic innate immune sensor involved in pyroptosis, yet 
paradoxically enhances inflammasome activity, suggesting differential modulation 
during infections. Our findings demonstrate the increasing power of structural 
homology screens to reveal proteins with unique combinations of domains that 
viruses capture from host genes and combine in unique ways.
