Several studies have shown an overlap between genes involved in the 
pathophysiological mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF) and Brugada Syndrome 
(BrS). We investigated whether three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
(rs11708996; G>C located intronic to SCN5A, rs10428132; T>G located in SCN10A, 
and rs9388451; T>C located downstream to HEY2) at loci associated with BrS in a 
recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) also were associated with AF. A 
total of 657 patients diagnosed with AF and a control group comprising 741 
individuals free of AF were included. The three SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan 
assays. The frequencies of risk alleles in the AF population and the control 
population were compared in two-by-two models. One variant, rs10428132 at 
SCN10A, was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of AF 
(odds ratio (OR)=0.77, P=0.001). A meta-analysis was performed by enriching the 
control population with allele frequencies from controls in the recently 
published BrS GWAS (2230 alleles). In this meta-analysis, both rs10428132 at 
SCN10A (OR=0.73, P=5.7 × 10(-6)) and rs11708996 at SCN5A (OR=0.80, P=0.02) 
showed a statistically significant decreased risk of AF. When assessing the 
additive effect of the three loci, we found that the risk of AF decreased in a 
dose-responsive manner with increasing numbers of risk alleles (OR=0.50, P=0.001 
for individuals carrying ≥4 risk alleles vs ≤1 allele). In conclusion, the 
prevalence of three risk alleles previously associated with BrS was lower in AF 
patients than in patients free of AF, suggesting a protective role of these loci 
in developing AF.
