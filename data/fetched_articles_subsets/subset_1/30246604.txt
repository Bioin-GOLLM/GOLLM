This exploratory study describes the development of a classification system for 
dogs' attachment security to caregivers that adheres closely to Ainsworth's 
seminal methodology. Fifty-nine adult dogs and caregivers participated in a 
mildly threatening laboratory encounter with a stranger (TS) and the Strange 
Situation (SSP). Dog and attachment experts adapted Ainsworth's classification 
system  for the behavioral repertoire of the dog. Four potentially comparable 
patterns of attachment were identified. The proportions of secure and insecure 
classifications (61% and 39%) were similar to those found in human toddlers. 
Caregivers' sensitivity to their dogs during the TS procedure significantly 
differentiated dogs with secure vs. insecure classifications Lower scores on the 
Active/excited personality scale on the Monash Canine Personality 
Questionnaire-Revised (MCPQ-R) also were related to secure classification. This 
system now makes it possible to compare directly the effects of human and dog 
attachment patterns on the health and emotional well-being of humans and dogs.
