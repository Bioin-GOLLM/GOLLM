Previous studies have shown that in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) multiple 
motor and extra-motor regions display structural and functional alterations. 
However, their temporal dynamics during disease-progression are unknown. To 
address this question we employed a longitudinal design assessing motor- and 
novelty-related brain activity in two fMRI sessions separated by a 3-month 
interval. In each session, patients and controls executed a Go/NoGo-task, in 
which additional presentation of novel stimuli served to elicit hippocampal 
activity. We observed a decline in the patients' movement-related activity 
during the 3-month interval. Importantly, in comparison to controls, the 
patients' motor activations were higher during the initial measurement. Thus, 
the relative decrease seems to reflect a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms 
due to progressive neural loss within the motor-system. In contrast, the 
patients' novelty-evoked hippocampal activity increased across 3Â months, most 
likely reflecting the build-up of compensatory processes typically observed at 
the beginning of lesions. Consistent with a stage-dependent emergence of 
hippocampal and motor-system lesions, we observed a positive correlation between 
the ALSFRS-R or MRC-Megascores and the decline in motor activity, but a negative 
one with the hippocampal activation-increase. Finally, to determine whether the 
observed functional changes co-occur with structural alterations, we performed 
voxel-based volumetric analyses on magnetization transfer images in a separate 
patient cohort studied cross-sectionally at another scanning site. Therein, we 
observed a close overlap between the structural changes in this cohort, and the 
functional alterations in the other. Thus, our results provide important 
insights into the temporal dynamics of functional alterations during 
disease-progression, and provide support for an anatomical relationship between 
functional and structural cerebral changes in ALS.
