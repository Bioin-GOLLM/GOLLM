Whole exome sequencing and copy-number variant analysis was performed on a 
family with three brothers diagnosed with autism. Each of the siblings shares an 
alteration in the nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 2 (NR3C2) gene 
that is predicted to result in a stop-gain mutation (p.Q919X) in the 
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) protein. This variant was maternally inherited 
and provides further evidence for a connection between the NR3C2 and autism. 
Interestingly, the NR3C2 gene encodes the MR protein, a steroid 
hormone-regulated transcription factor that acts in the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and has been connected to stress and 
anxiety, both of which are features often seen in individuals with autism.

underlying autism, each gene contributes to risk in a relatively small number of 
individuals, typically less than 1% of all autism cases. Whole exome sequencing 
of three brothers with autism identified a rare variant in the nuclear receptor 
subfamily 3 group C member 2 gene that is predicted to strongly interfere with 
its normal function. This gene encodes the mineralocorticoid receptor protein, 
which plays a role in how the body responds to stress and anxiety, features that 
are often elevated in people diagnosed with autism. This study adds further 
support to the relevance of this gene as a risk factor for autism.
