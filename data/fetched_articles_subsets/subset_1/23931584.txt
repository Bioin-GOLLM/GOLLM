Recently, conformational changes of the amino-terminal helix (A'α helix), in 
addition to the reported conformational changes of the carboxyl-terminal helix 
(Jα helix), have been proposed to be important for the regulatory function of 
the light-oxygen-voltage 2 domain (LOV2) of phototropin 1 from Arabidopsis. 
However, the reaction dynamics of the A'α helix have not been examined. Here, 
the unfolding reactions of the A'α and Jα helices of the LOV2 domain of 
phototropin 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated by the time-resolved 
transient grating (TG) method. A mutant (T469I mutant) that renders the A'α 
helix unfolded in the dark state showed unfolding of the Jα helix with a time 
constant of 1 ms, which is very similar to the time constant reported for the 
wild-type LOV2-linker sample. Furthermore, a mutant (I608E mutant) that renders 
the Jα helix unfolded in the dark state exhibited an unfolding process of the 
A'α helix with a time constant of 12 ms. On the basis of these experimental 
results, it is suggested that the unfolding reactions of these helices occurs 
independently.
