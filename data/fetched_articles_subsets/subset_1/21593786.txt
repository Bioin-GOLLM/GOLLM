Recent data on DNA sequencing of human tumours have established that cancer 
cells contain thousands of mutations. These data support the concept that cancer 
cells express a mutator phenotype. This Perspective considers the evidence 
supporting the mutator phenotype hypothesis, the origin and consequences of a 
mutator phenotype, the implications for personalized medicine and the 
feasibility of ablating tumours by error catastrophe.
