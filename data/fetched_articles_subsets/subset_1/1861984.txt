Using a binding site selection procedure, we have found that sequence-specific 
DNA-binding by the mouse c-myb protein involves recognition of nucleotides 
outside of the previously identified hexanucleotide motif. Oligonucleotides 
containing a random nucleotide core were immunoprecipitated in association with 
c-Myb, amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction and cloned in plasmids prior 
to sequencing. By alignment of sequences it was apparent that additional 
preferences existed at each of three bases immediately 5' of the hexanucleotide 
consensus, allowing an extension of the preferred binding site to YGRCVGTTR. The 
contributions of these 5' nucleotides to binding affinity was established in 
bandshift analyses with oligonucleotides containing single base substitutions; 
in particular, it was found that replacement of the preferred guanine at 
position -2 with any other base greatly reduced c-Myb binding. We found that the 
protein encoded by the related B-myb gene bound the preferred c-Myb site with 
similar affinity; however, B-Myb and c-Myb showed distinct preferences for the 
identity of the nucleotide at position -1 relative to the hexanucleotide 
consensus. This study demonstrates that the c-Myb DNA-binding site is more 
extensive than recognised hitherto and points to similar but distinct nucleotide 
preferences in recognition of DNA by related Myb proteins.
