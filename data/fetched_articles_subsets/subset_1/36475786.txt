Ionic conductivity and membrane capacitance are two foundational parameters that 
govern neuron excitability. Conventional optogenetics has emerged as a powerful 
tool to temporarily manipulate membrane ionic conductivity in intact biological 
systems. However, no analogous method exists for precisely manipulating cell 
membrane capacitance to enable long-lasting modulation of neuronal excitability. 
Genetically targetable chemical assembly of conductive and insulating polymers 
can modulate cell membrane capacitance, but further development of this 
technique has been hindered by poor spatiotemporal control of the polymer 
deposition and cytotoxicity from the widely diffused peroxide. We address these 
issues by harnessing genetically targetable photosensitizer proteins to assemble 
electrically functional polymers in neurons with precise spatiotemporal control. 
Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we demonstrate that this optogenetic 
polymerization can achieve stepwise modulation of both neuron membrane 
capacitance and intrinsic excitability. Furthermore, cytotoxicity can be limited 
by controlling light exposure, demonstrating a promising new method for 
precisely modulating cell excitability.
