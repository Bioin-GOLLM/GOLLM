Nemaline myopathy-4 (NEM4) is a very rare inherited muscle disorder caused by a 
heterozygous mutation in tropomyosin-2 (TPM2) gene. We established an induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a 
3-month-old girl with NEM4 carrying a heterozygous mutation (c.397C>T (p.R133W)) 
in TPM2 gene. This iPSC line showed a normal karyotype, expressed pluripotency 
markers, showed differentiation potential and harbored the original mutation of 
c.397C>T in the TPM2 gene.
