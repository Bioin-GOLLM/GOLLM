Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer in women in Mexico, and its 
development depends on the presence of human papillomaviruses in the uterine 
cervix. These oncogenic viruses transform cells where the control over cell 
cycle disappears, and the capacity to induce apoptosis is absent. On the other 
hand, some mutations confer to the transformed cells the ability to evade 
recognition by the immune system. The expression of markers of the immune system 
such as CD95, MICA/B, CD39, CD73, NKp30, NKp46, CD44, CD24, NKG2A, and CTLA-4 
was analysed by flow cytometry on cervical cancer cells INBL (HPV 18, stage 
IVB), HeLa (HPV 18), CaSki (HPV 16), and C33A (HPV-). Our results showed the 
presence of atypical markers on cervical cancer cells; some of them are 
molecules involved in tumour cell recognition such as MICA/B and CD95. Other 
markers associated with immune system escape, such as CD39, CD73, and CTLA-4, 
were also present. Furthermore, we found that some cervical cancer cells 
expressed typical markers of NK cells like NKp30, NKp46, NKG2A, and KIR3DL1. It 
is not clear whether these molecules confer any gain to the tumour cells or if 
they represent a disadvantage, but we hypothesise that these molecules that are 
present in cervical cancer cells allow them to mimic in front of the immune 
system.
