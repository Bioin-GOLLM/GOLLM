Dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) has been consistently reported to be associated with 
schizophrenia. However data from East Asian population has been sparse and 
inconsistent till today. This study tried to replicate the genetic association 
of DTNBP1 with schizophrenia in a large Korean sample, as well as analyzing the 
association of DTNBP1 with clinical variables. Nine hundred and eight (908) 
patients with schizophrenia and 601 controls were investigated. The 
high-throughput genotyping method using pyrosequencer (Biotage AB, Sweden) was 
used for genotyping 4 SNPs (rs3213207, rs1011313, rs760761, and rs2619522). 
Haplotype analyses revealed a significant association with schizophrenia (P < 
0.0001) with the haplotypes A-C-C-C and A-C-T-A having an eminent protective 
effect toward schizophrenia. The major contribution to the difference in the 
haplotype distribution between patients and the controls was the rs760761 (C/T) 
and rs2619522 (A/C) haplotypes (P < 0.0001). No association of DTNBP1 with other 
clinical variables was found. In conclusion, the present study suggests a 
possible protective effect of rare DTNBP1 variants in schizophrenia, although 
subsequent studies in different ethnic groups are warranted.
