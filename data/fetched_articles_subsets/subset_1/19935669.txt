Directed evolution circumvents our profound ignorance of how a protein's 
sequence encodes its function by using iterative rounds of random mutation and 
artificial selection to discover new and useful proteins. Proteins can be tuned 
to adapt to new functions or environments by simple adaptive walks involving 
small numbers of mutations. Directed evolution studies have shown how rapidly 
some proteins can evolve under strong selection pressures and, because the 
entire 'fossil record' of evolutionary intermediates is available for detailed 
study, they have provided new insight into the relationship between sequence and 
function. Directed evolution has also shown how mutations that are functionally 
neutral can set the stage for further adaptation.
