Therapeutic targeting of CDK7 has proven beneficial in preclinical studies, yet 
the off-target effects of currently available CDK7 inhibitors make it difficult 
to pinpoint the exact mechanisms behind MM cell death mediated by CDK7 
inhibition. Here, we show that CDK7 expression positively correlates with E2F 
and MYC transcriptional programs in cells from patients with multiple myeloma 
(MM); its selective targeting counteracts E2F activity via perturbation of the 
cyclin-dependent kinases/Rb axis and impairs MYC-regulated metabolic gene 
signatures translating into defects in glycolysis and reduced levels of lactate 
production in MM cells. CDK7 inhibition using the covalent small-molecule 
inhibitor YKL-5-124 elicits a strong therapeutic response with minimal effects 
on normal cells, and causes in vivo tumor regression, increasing survival in 
several mouse models of MM including a genetically engineered mouse model of 
MYC-dependent MM. Through its role as a critical cofactor and regulator of MYC 
and E2F activity, CDK7 is therefore a master regulator of oncogenic cellular 
programs supporting MM growth and survival, and a valuable therapeutic target 
providing rationale for development of YKL-5-124 for clinical use.
