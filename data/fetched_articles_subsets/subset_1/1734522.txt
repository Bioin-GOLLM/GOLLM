The protein encoded by the human testis determining gene, SRY, contains a high 
mobility group (HMG) box related to that present in the T cell-specific, 
DNA-binding protein TCF-1. Recombinant SRY protein was able to bind to the same 
core sequence AACAAAG recognized by TCF-1 in a sequence dependent manner. In 
five XY females point mutations were found in the region encoding the HMG box. 
In four cases DNA binding activity of mutant SRY protein was negligible; in the 
fifth case DNA binding was reduced. These results imply that the DNA binding 
activity of SRY is required for sex determination.
