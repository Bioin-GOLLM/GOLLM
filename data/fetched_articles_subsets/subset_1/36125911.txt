BackgroundAntineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated (ANCA-associated) 
vasculitidies (AAV) are life-threatening systemic autoimmune conditions. ANCAs 
directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) bind their cell 
surface-presented antigen, activate neutrophils, and cause vasculitis. An 
imbalance between PR3 and its major inhibitor α1-antitrypsin (AAT) was proposed 
to underlie PR3- but not MPO-AAV. We measured AAT and PR3 in healthy individuals 
and patients with AAV and studied protective AAT effects pertaining to PR3- and 
MPO-ANCA.MethodsPlasma and blood neutrophils were assessed for PR3 and AAT. WT, 
mutant, and oxidation-resistant AAT species were produced to characterize 
AAT-PR3 interactions by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, fluorescence resonance 
energy transfer assays, and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Neutrophil 
activation was measured using the ferricytochrome C assay and AAT 
methionine-oxidation by Parallel Reaction Monitoring.ResultsWe found 
significantly increased PR3 and AAT pools in patients with both PR3- and 
MPO-AAV; however, only in PR3-AAV did the PR3 pool correlate with the ANCA 
titer, inflammatory response, and disease severity. Mechanistically, AAT 
prevented PR3 from binding to CD177, thereby reducing neutrophil surface antigen 
for ligation by PR3-ANCA. Active patients with PR3-AAV showed critical 
methionine-oxidation in plasma AAT that was recapitulated by ANCA-activated 
neutrophils. The protective PR3-related AAT effects were compromised by 
methionine-oxidation in the AAT reactive center loop but preserved when 2 
critical methionines were substituted with valine and 
leucine.ConclusionPathogenic differences between PR3- and MPO-AAV are related to 
AAT regulation of membrane-PR3, attenuating neutrophil activation by PR3-ANCA 
rather than MPO-ANCA. Oxidation-resistant AAT could serve as adjunctive therapy 
in PR3-AAV.FUNDINGThis work was supported by KE 576/10-1 from the Deutsche
