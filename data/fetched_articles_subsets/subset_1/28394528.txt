Currently, despite the growing prevalence of female pelvic floor dysfunction, no 
consensus exists among researchers regarding its etiology and pathogenesis. 
There is no doubt, however, that this is a multifactorial disorder with a 
genetic predisposition. The risk for developing pelvic floor dysfunction is 
determined by the interaction of multiple additive genetic (mutations and/or 
polymorphic alleles) and environmental factors. This review of the world 
literature presents a rationale for searching specific molecular genetic factors 
shaping the structure of the genetic susceptibility to female pelvic floor 
dysfunction. The pelvic organ prolapse in women has been found to be associated 
with the rs1800012 polymorphism of the COL1A1 gene, genotype rs1800255-A/A of 
COL3A1 gene and the rs2228480 polymorphism of ESR1, although this data still 
controversial and need to be validated in the independent samples. The 
systematic accumulation of data, their reproduction in different populations and 
ethnic groups is necessary to further generalize the evidence on the 
pathogenesis and the functional significance of each gene variant.
