BACKGROUND: The frequency of the alpha thalassemia trait is approximately 40% in 
the Kuwaiti population, but there has been no comprehensive study of the 
prevalent alleles. This is a report of patients who were referred for molecular 
diagnosis over a 20-year period.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the α-globin genotypes obtained in the 
Hemoglobin Research Laboratory of the Department of Pediatrics, Kuwait 
University from 1994 to 2015. Genotyping was performed by a combination of PCR, 
allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and reverse dot blot hybridization 
(Vienna Lab Strip Assay).
RESULTS: Four hundred samples were characterized and analyzed from individuals 
aged < 1 month to 80 years, with a median of 6 years from 283 unrelated 
families. Most (90.8%) were Kuwaiti nationals. The commonest genotype was 
homozygosity for the polyadenylation-1 mutation (αPA-1α/α PA-1α) in 33.3% of the 
samples, followed by heterozygosity (αα/α PA-1α) for the same mutation in 32.3%. 
PA-1 was therefore the most frequent allele (0.59). The frequency of the α0 
(--MED) allele was 0.017. Rare alleles that were found in very low frequencies 
included α0 (--FIL) in a Filipino child, Hb Constant Spring, Hb Adana, and Hb 
Icaria.
CONCLUSION: There is a wide variety of alpha thalassemia alleles among Kuwaitis, 
but nondeletional PA-1 is by far the most common cause of the moderate to severe 
HbH (β4 tetramer) disease phenotype. The α0 (-MED) allele is also encountered, 
which has implications for premarital counseling, especially for the possibility 
of having babies with alpha thalassemia major (Barts hydrops fetalis).
