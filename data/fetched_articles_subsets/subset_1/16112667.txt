Experimental evidence supports a role for E-cadherin in suppressing invasion, 
metastasis, and proliferation. Germline mutations of the E-cadherin represent 
the genetic cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). In this type of 
tumor, isolated cancer cells permeate the basal membrane and paradoxically 
survive in the gastric wall in the absence of contact with neighbor epithelial 
cells or with the extracellular matrix. This suggests that upon E-cadherin 
deregulation, cells acquired resistance to apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, 
CHO cells stably expressing either wild-type E-cadherin or the HDGC-related 
germline mutations T340A and V832M were seeded either on a thin layer of 
collagen type I or on plastic and then subjected to the apoptotic agent taxol. 
We found that in vitro functional E-cadherin renders cells more sensitive to the 
effect of taxol. Our results also indicate that this effect is associated to 
decreased level of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein.
