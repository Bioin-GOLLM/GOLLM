BACKGROUND: Seeding of pathology related to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy 
body disease (LBD) by tissue homogenates or purified protein aggregates in 
various model systems has revealed prion-like properties of these disorders. 
Typically, these homogenates are injected into adult mice stereotaxically. 
Injection of brain lysates into newborn mice represents an alternative approach 
of delivering seeds that could direct the evolution of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology 
co-mixed with either tau or α-synuclein (αSyn) pathology in susceptible mouse 
models.
METHODS: Homogenates of human pre-frontal cortex were injected into the lateral 
ventricles of newborn (P0) mice expressing a mutant humanized amyloid precursor 
protein (APP), human P301L tau, human wild type αSyn, or combinations thereof. 
The homogenates were prepared from AD and AD/LBD cases displaying variable 
degrees of Aβ pathology and co-existing tau and αSyn deposits. Behavioral 
assessments of APP transgenic mice injected with AD brain lysates were 
conducted. For comparison, homogenates of aged APP transgenic mice that 
preferentially exhibit diffuse or cored deposits were similarly injected into 
the brains of newborn APP mice.
RESULTS: We observed that lysates from the brains with AD (Aβ+, tau+), AD/LBD 
(Aβ+, tau+, αSyn+), or Pathological Aging (Aβ+, tau-, αSyn-) efficiently seeded 
diffuse Aβ deposits. Moderate seeding of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was 
also observed. No animal of any genotype developed discernable tau or αSyn 
pathology. Performance in fear-conditioning cognitive tasks was not 
significantly altered in APP transgenic animals injected with AD brain lysates 
compared to nontransgenic controls. Homogenates prepared from aged APP 
transgenic mice with diffuse Aβ deposits induced similar deposits in APP host 
mice; whereas homogenates from APP mice with cored deposits induced similar 
cored deposits, albeit at a lower level.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the idea that diffuse Aβ 
pathology, which is a common feature of human AD, AD/LBD, and PA brains, may 
arise from a distinct strain of misfolded Aβ that is highly transmissible to 
newborn transgenic APP mice. Seeding of tau or αSyn comorbidities was 
inefficient in the models we used, indicating that additional methodological 
refinement will be needed to efficiently seed AD or AD/LBD mixed pathologies by 
injecting newborn mice.
