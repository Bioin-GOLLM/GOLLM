Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA) is an ophthalmological condition 
associated primarily with mutations in the OPA1 gene. It has variable onset, 
sometimes juvenile, but in other patients, the disease does not manifest until 
adult middle age despite the presence of a pathological mutation. Thus, 
individuals carrying mutations are considered healthy before the onset of 
clinical symptoms. Our research, nonetheless, indicates that on the cellular 
level pathology is evident from birth and mutant cells are different from 
controls. We argue that the adaptation and early recruitment of cytoprotective 
responses allows normal development and functioning but leads to an exhaustion 
of cellular reserves, leading to premature cellular aging, especially in neurons 
and skeletal muscle cells. The appearance of clinical symptoms, thus, indicates 
the overwhelming of natural cellular defenses and break-down of native 
protective mechanisms.
