E-commerce research usually focuses more on how to protect consumers' rights and 
increase their purchase intention from the perspective of consumers. However, we 
still lack understanding of e-commerce sellers, especially cross-border 
e-commerce sellers. Based on the stimulus-body-response theory, this paper built 
a moderated mediation model to test the relationships among social support, 
perceived benefits, perceived usefulness and sellers' willingness to retain. The 
results show that social support has a positive impact on perceived benefits and 
sellers' willingness to retain; perceived benefits play a partial intermediary 
role between social support and sellers' willingness to retain; and perceived 
usefulness moderates these mediating effects. The research results further 
expand the perspective of e-commerce research and reveal the mechanism and 
boundary conditions of the influence of social support on the retention 
willingness of cross-border e-commerce sellers.
