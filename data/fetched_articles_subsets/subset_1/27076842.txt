Lung cancer ranks as the most common and lethal malignancy in America and 
worldwide. APOBEC3B is a newly identified DNA cytosine deaminase, which is 
supposed to function as a major source of DNA mutation in many different tumors. 
In this study, we combine the data of online databases and two hundred and 
twenty-one primary non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) specimens from Sun 
Yat-sen University Cancer Center to investigate, for the first time, the 
clinical role of APOBEC3B in lung cancer. We found that the APOBEC3 expression 
was commonly elevated in NSCLC tissues and overexpression of APOBEC3B was 
correlated with unfavorable prognosis of the patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, 
APOBEC3B expression was associated with nodal status, TNM staging and adjuvant 
chemotherapy of the patients with NSCLC. Further research is warranted.
