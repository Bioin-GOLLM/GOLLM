Designer transcription-activator like effectors (TALEs) is a promising 
technology and made it possible to edit genomes with higher specificity. Such 
specific engineering and gene regulation technologies are also being developed 
using RNA-binding proteins like PUFs and PPRs. The main feature of TALEs, PUFs 
and PPRs is their repetitive DNA/RNA-binding domains which have single 
nucleotide binding specificity. Available kits today allow researchers to 
assemble these repetitive domains in any combination they desire when generating 
TALEs for gene targeting and editing. However, PCR amplifications of such 
repetitive DNAs are highly problematic as these mostly fail, generating 
undesired artifact products or deletions. Here we describe the molecular 
mechanisms leading to these artifacts. We tested our models also in plasmid 
templates containing one copy versus two copies of GFP-coding sequence arranged 
as either direct or inverted repeats. Some limited solutions in amplifying 
repetitive DNA regions are described.
