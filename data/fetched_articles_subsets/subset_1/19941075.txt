The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) promoter -2518 A/G polymorphism 
has been reported inconsistently to be associated with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of this study was to 
explore whether the MCP-1 polymorphism confers susceptibility to SLE or LN. We 
surveyed studies on the MCP-1 polymorphism and SLE or LN identified by MEDLINE 
or manual searches. Meta-analysis was conducted on the AA genotype (recessive 
effect), AA, and AG genotypes (dominant effect), AA versus GG (genotype 
contrast), and on the A allele of MCP-1 in SLE and LN in each ethnic population 
studied and on all subjects. Ten studies, which included 1,739 SLE patients and 
1,680 controls, were included in our meta-analysis. These consisted of two 
European, six Asian, one Latin American, and one mixed study. We did not find 
any association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE in all subjects 
or in ethnic groups. Meta-analysis also failed to reveal an association between 
the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphisms and LN. This meta-analysis on 3419 subjects 
indicates that no association exists between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism 
and SLE or LN.
