Mycosphaerella graminicola.

Mycosphoerella graminicola (anamorph: Zymoseptoria tritici), causal agent of 
Septoria tritici blotch, is currently one of the most damaging diseases on both 
bread and durum wheat crops worldwide. Since wheat resistance against this 
pathogen is always partial at various extents in most cultivars, disease control 
relies mainly on the use of fungicides. However, management of fungicide 
applications is necessary in order to avoid the emergence and widespread of 
fungicide resistant genotypes within populations of the pathogen. In the present 
study, we investigated for the first time the resistance of M. graminicola 
toward strobilurin fungicides in Algeria. This was performed by identifying the 
G143A substitution of the cytochrome b encoding sequence (which confers 
resistance to strobilurins) in a collection of 120 single-conidial isolates. 
These isolates have been sampled during the 2012 growing season from five 
distinct geographical locations (Guelma, Annaba, Constantine, Skikda and Oran). 
We used a PCR-based mismatch mutation assay allowing the amplification of either 
G143 (sensitive) or A143 (resistant) allele in each isolate. This study should 
give valuable information regarding the management of strobilurin use in order 
to control in a durable manner M. graminicola epidemics in Algeria.
