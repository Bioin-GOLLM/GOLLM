The endothelium plays a crucial role in inflammation. A balanced control of 
inflammation requires the action of glucocorticoids (GCs), steroidal hormones 
with potent cell-specific anti-inflammatory properties. Besides the classic 
anti-inflammatory effects of GCs on leukocytes, recent studies confirm that 
endothelial cells also represent an important target for GCs. GCs regulate 
different aspects of endothelial physiology including expression of adhesion 
molecules, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and 
maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity. However, the regulation of 
endothelial GC sensitivity remains incompletely understood. In this review, we 
specifically examine the endothelial response to GCs in various inflammatory 
diseases ranging from multiple sclerosis, stroke, sepsis, and vasculitis to 
atherosclerosis. Shedding more light on the cross talk between GCs and 
endothelium will help to improve existing therapeutic strategies and develop new 
therapies better tailored to the needs of patients.
