The root cause of non-inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown despite 
hundreds of research studies performed to attempt to solve this problem. Since 
proper prophylaxis remains the best strategy, many scientists have studied the 
risk factors that may affect AD development. There is robust evidence supporting 
the hypothesis that cardiovascular diseases (CVD) may contribute to AD 
progression, as the diseases often coexist. Therefore, a lack of well-defined 
diagnostic criteria makes studying the relationship between AD and CVD 
complicated. Additionally, inflammation accompanies the pathogenesis of AD and 
CVD, and is not only a consequence but also implicated as a significant 
contributor to the course of the diseases. Of note, АроЕε4 is found to be one of 
the major risk factors affecting both the cardiovascular and nervous systems. 
According to genome wide association and epidemiological studies, numerous 
common risk factors have been associated with the development of AD-related 
pathology. Furthermore, the risk of developing AD and CVDs appears to be 
increased by a wide range of conditions and lifestyle factors: hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, gut/oral microbiota, 
physical activity, and diet. This review summarizes the literature and provides 
possible mechanistic links between CVDs and AD.
