Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) constitute a class of small RNAs that bind PIWI 
proteins and are essential to repress transposable elements in the animal 
germline, thereby promoting genome stability and maintaining fertility. C. 
elegans piRNAs (21U RNAs) are transcribed individually from minigenes as 
precursors that require 5' and 3' processing. This process depends on the 
PETISCO complex, consisting of four proteins: IFE-3, TOFU-6, PID-3, and ERH-2. 
We used biochemical and structural biology approaches to characterize the 
PETISCO architecture and its interaction with RNA, together with its effector 
proteins TOST-1 and PID-1. These two proteins define different PETISCO 
functions: PID-1 governs 21U processing, whereas TOST-1 links PETISCO to an 
unknown process essential for early embryogenesis. Here, we show that PETISCO 
forms an octameric assembly with each subunit present in two copies. 
Determination of structures of the TOFU-6/PID-3 and PID-3/ERH-2 subcomplexes, 
supported by in vivo studies of subunit interaction mutants, allows us to 
propose a model for the formation of the TOFU-6/PID-3/ERH-2 core complex and its 
functionality in germ cells and early embryos. Using NMR spectroscopy, we 
demonstrate that TOST-1 and PID-1 bind to a common surface on ERH-2, located 
opposite its PID-3 binding site, explaining how PETISCO can mediate different 
cellular roles.
