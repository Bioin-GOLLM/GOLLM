Concomitant profiling of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in isolated 
nuclei can reveal gene regulatory control mechanisms in health and disease. We 
report a single nucleus multi-omics analysis protocol optimized for frozen 
archived postmortem human pituitaries that is also effective for frozen ovine 
and murine pituitaries and human skeletal muscle biopsies. Its main advantages 
are that (1) it is not limited to fresh tissue, (2) it avoids tissue 
dissociation-induced transcriptional changes, and (3) it includes a novel, 
automated quality control pipeline. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Ruf-Zamojski et al. (2021) and Zhang 
et al. (2022).
