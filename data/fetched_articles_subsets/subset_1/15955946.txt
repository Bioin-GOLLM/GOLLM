BACKGROUND: Dominant mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3, the three genes 
encoding collagen type VI, a ubiquitous extracellular matrix protein, are 
associated with Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich scleroatonic muscular 
dystrophy.
METHODS: The authors devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence of 
the three genes by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of total RNA from 
skin fibroblasts and direct sequencing of the resulting 25 overlapping cDNA 
fragments covering 107 exons.
RESULTS: Four splicing and four missense mutations were identified in 16 
patients with BM, six of which are novel mutations in COL6A1. Both common and 
private mutations are localized in the alpha1 (VI) chain between the regions 
corresponding to the 3' end of the NH2-globular domain and the 5' end of the 
triple helix, encoded by exons 3 through 14.
CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of the mutations in a relatively narrow area of the 
three collagen type VI chains in patients with Bethlem myopathy (BM) suggests 
that mutations in different regions could result in different phenotypes or in 
no phenotype at all. Moreover, the detection of mutations in only 60% of the 
patients suggests the existence of at least another gene associated with BM. The 
authors propose the direct sequencing of COL6 cDNAs as the first mutation 
screening analysis in BM, given the high number of exon-skipping events.
