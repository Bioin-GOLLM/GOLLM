Efficient intracellular drug delivery and target specificity are often hampered 
by the presence of biological barriers. Thus, compounds that efficiently cross 
cell membranes are the key to improving the therapeutic value and on-target 
specificity of non-permeable drugs. The discovery of cell-penetrating peptides 
(CPPs) and the early design approaches through mimicking the natural penetration 
domains used by viruses have led to greater efficiency of intracellular 
delivery. Following these nature-inspired examples, a number of rationally 
designed CPPs has been developed. In this review, a variety of CPP designs will 
be described, including linear and flexible, positively charged and often 
amphipathic CPPs, and more rigid versions comprising cyclic, stapled, or dimeric 
and/or multivalent, self-assembled peptides or peptido-mimetics. The application 
of distinct design strategies to known physico-chemical properties of CPPs 
offers the opportunity to improve their penetration efficiency and/or 
internalization kinetics. This led to increased design complexity of new CPPs 
that does not always result in greater CPP activity. Therefore, the transition 
of CPPs to a clinical setting remains a challenge also due to the concomitant 
involvement of various internalization routes and heterogeneity of cells used in 
the in vitro studies.
