The enzyme encoded by the MGMT gene is involved in the repair of alkylated 
lesions formed in DNA by carcinogenic nitrosamines. Since dietary items consumed 
by the Kashmiri population contain high concentrations of these agents, it is 
biologically plausible that MGMT polymorphic variants may be associated with 
their risk of esophageal cancer. The present study was performed to assess 
whether non-synonymous SNPS at codon Leu84Phe and codon Ileu143Val of the MGMT 
gene, close to the active site of the protein, might be linked to predisposition 
of Kashmiris to esophageal cancer. Genotyping was carried out by polymerase 
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism on 92 cases and 77 
healthy controls. Codon 84 and codon 143 SNPs of the MGMT gene were not 
associated with any increase in risk. While the frequency of the Phe allele at 
codon 84 in cases was (0.16), slightly higher than controls (0.12), the 
difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the frequency of Valine 
allele in cases at codon 143 (0.08) and controls (0.09) was nearly equal. 
Moreover, no significant association of MGMT genotypes with the clinicopatholgic 
variables of esophageal cancer patients was observed. In conclusion, MGMT 
variants at codon 84 and codon143 may not be involved in the susceptibility of 
the Kashmiri population to esophageal cancer.
