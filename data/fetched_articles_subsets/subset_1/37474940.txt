BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown an association between higher 
bilirubin levels and improved respiratory health outcomes. Targeting higher 
bilirubin levels has been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy in COPD. 
However, bilirubin levels are influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic 
factors, and these observational studies are prone to confounding. Genetic 
analyses are one approach to overcoming residual confounding in observational 
studies.
OBJECTIVES: To test associations between a genetic determinant of bilirubin 
levels and respiratory health outcomes.
METHODS: COPDGene participants underwent genotyping at the baseline visit. We 
confirmed established associations between homozygosity for rs6742078 and higher 
bilirubin, and between higher bilirubin and decreased risk of acute respiratory 
events within this cohort. For our primary analysis, we used negative binomial 
regression to test associations between homozygosity for rs6742078 and rate of 
acute respiratory events.
RESULTS: 8,727 participants (n = 6,228 non-Hispanic white and 2,499 African 
American) were included. Higher bilirubin was associated with decreased rate of 
acute respiratory events [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96 
per SD increase in bilirubin intensity]. We did not find significant 
associations between homozygosity for rs6742078 and acute respiratory events 
(IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25 for non-Hispanic white and 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 
1.31 for African American participants).
CONCLUSIONS: A genetic determinant of higher bilirubin levels was not associated 
with better respiratory health outcomes. These results do not support targeting 
higher bilirubin levels as a therapeutic strategy in COPD.
