Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide due to 
its late diagnosis and poor outcomes. As has been found for other types of 
tumors, there is increasing evidence that myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs) play important roles in the promotion and progression of LC. Here, we 
briefly introduce the definition of MDSCs and their immunosuppressive functions. 
We next specifically discuss the multiple roles of MDSCs in the lung tumor 
microenvironment, including those in tumor growth and progression mediated by 
inhibiting antitumor immunity, and the associations of MDSCs with a poor 
prognosis and increased resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Finally, 
we also discuss preclinical and clinical treatment strategies targeting MDSCs, 
which may have the potential to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.
