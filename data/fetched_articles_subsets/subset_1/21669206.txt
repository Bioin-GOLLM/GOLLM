Nucleosomes sterically occlude their wrapped DNA from interacting with many 
large protein complexes. How proteins gain access to nucleosomal DNA target 
sites in vivo is not known. Outer stretches of nucleosomal DNA spontaneously 
unwrap and rewrap with high frequency, providing rapid and efficient access to 
regulatory DNA target sites located there; however, rates for access to the 
nucleosome interior have not been measured. Here we show that for a selected 
high-affinity nucleosome positioning sequence, the spontaneous DNA unwrapping 
rate decreases dramatically with distance inside the nucleosome. The rewrapping 
rate also decreases, but only slightly. Our results explain the previously known 
strong position dependence on the equilibrium accessibility of nucleosomal DNA, 
which is characteristic of both selected and natural sequences. Our results 
point to slow nucleosome conformational fluctuations as a potential source of 
cell-cell variability in gene activation dynamics, and they reveal the dominant 
kinetic path by which multiple DNA binding proteins cooperatively invade a 
nucleosome.
