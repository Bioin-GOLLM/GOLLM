INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to investigate genotype-phenotype 
correlations, the consequences for surgical treatment, and the therapeutical 
options in patients with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated MCD genotype by using polymerase chain 
reaction followed by direct sequencing in one family and four patients with MCD. 
Results were confirmed by restriction analysis. Clinical phenotypes, 
histopathological findings, and therapeutical proceedings of each patient were 
reported and compared with the molecular genetic results.
RESULTS: Five mutations, four missense mutations, and one frameshift mutation, 
from which three were novel, and one single-nucleotide polymorphism, were 
identified within the coding region of the CHST6 gene. In three patients, two 
with a homozygous mutation within the start codon (Met1Leu) and one with a 
heterozygous mutation (Leu200Arg) and a polymorphism (Arg162Gly), with irregular 
corneal surface and recurrent erosions a phototherapeutic keratectomy lead to a 
transient success. An additional fitting of rigid gas permeable contact lenses 
in one patient could further improve irregular astigmatism. In two patients, one 
with a frameshift mutation (1734_1735delTG; Arg211Gln) and one with two compound 
heterozygous mutations (Leu200Arg; Leu173Phe) and an additional polymorphism 
(Arg162Gly) a penetrating keratoplasty improved BCVA without any recurrence of 
the opacities within the follow-up time.
DISCUSSION: Different genotypes imply several phenotypes, which influence 
therapeutical proceedings in MCD patients. Our study shows the wide range of 
diagnostic findings and therapeutical options in patients suffering from macular 
corneal dystrophy depending on the genotype.
