The dorsal raphe (DR) is an evolutionarily conserved brain structure that is 
involved in aggressive behavior. It projects onto numerous cortical and limbic 
areas underlying attack behavior. The specific neurocircuit through which the DR 
regulates aggression, however, is largely unclear. In this study we show that DR 
neurons expressing CaMKIIα are activated by attack behavior in mice. These 
neurons project to the medial aspect of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; MeOC) and 
the medial amygdala (MeA), two key regions within the neural circuit known to 
control aggressive behavior. Using an in vivo optogenetic approach, we show that 
attack bouts are shortened by inhibiting CaMKIIα+ neurons in the DR and their 
axons at the MeOC and prolonged by stimulating the DR-MeOC axons during an 
attack. By contrast, stimulating the axons of CaMKIIα+ DR neurons at the MeA 
shortens attack. Notably, neither the DR-MeOC or DR-MeA pathway initiates attack 
when stimulated. These results indicate that the DR-MeOC and DR-MeA pathways 
regulate the duration of attack behavior in opposite directions, revealing a 
circuit mechanism for the control of attack by the DR.
