Declarative memories are thought to be stored within anatomically distributed 
neuronal networks requiring the hippocampus; however, it is unclear how 
neocortical areas participate in memory at the time of encoding. Here, we use a 
c-fos-based genetic tagging system to selectively express the channelrhodopsin 
variant, ChEF, and optogenetically reactivate a specific neural ensemble in 
retrosplenial cortex (RSC) engaged by context fear conditioning. Artificial 
stimulation of RSC was sufficient to produce both context-specific behavior and 
downstream cellular activity commensurate with natural experience. Moreover, 
optogenetically but not contextually elicited responses were insensitive to 
hippocampal inactivation, suggesting that although the hippocampus is needed to 
coordinate activation by sensory cues, a higher-order cortical framework can 
independently subserve learned behavior, even shortly after learning.
