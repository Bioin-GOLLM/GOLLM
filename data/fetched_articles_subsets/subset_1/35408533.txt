Ferroptosis is a recently described programmed cell death mechanism that is 
characterized by the buildup of iron (Fe)-dependent lipid peroxides in cells and 
is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from other forms of 
cell death, having emerged to play an important role in cancer biology. 
Ferroptosis has significant importance during cancer treatment because of the 
combination of factors, including suppression of the glutathione peroxidase 4 
(Gpx4), cysteine deficiency, and arachidonoyl (AA) peroxidation, which cause 
cells to undergo ferroptosis. However, the physiological significance of 
ferroptosis throughout development is still not fully understood. This current 
review is focused on the factors and molecular mechanisms with the diagrammatic 
illustrations of ferroptosis that have a role in the initiation and sensitivity 
of ferroptosis in various malignancies. This knowledge will open a new road for 
research in oncology and cancer management.
