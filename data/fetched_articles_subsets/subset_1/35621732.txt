Transposable elements (TEs) are genetically mobile units that move from one site 
to another within a genome. These units can mediate regulatory changes that can 
result in massive changes in genes expression. In fact, a precise identification 
of TEs can allow the detection of the mechanisms involving these elements in 
gene regulation and genome evolution. In the present study, a genome-wide 
analysis of the Hemipteran pest Bemisia tabaci was conducted using 
bioinformatics tools to identify, annotate and estimate the age of TEs, in 
addition to their insertion sites, within or near of the defensome genes 
involved in insecticide resistance. Overall, 1,292,393 TE copies were identified 
in the B. tabaci genome grouped into 4872 lineages. A total of 699 lineages were 
found to belong to Class I of TEs, 1348 belong to Class II, and 2825 were 
uncategorized and form the largest part of TEs (28.81%). The TE age estimation 
revealed that the oldest TEs invasion happened 14 million years ago (MYA) and 
the most recent occurred 0.2 MYA with the insertion of Class II TE elements. The 
analysis of TE insertion sites in defensome genes revealed 94 insertions. Six of 
these TE insertions were found within or near previously identified 
differentially expressed insecticide resistance genes. These insertions may have 
a potential role in the observed insecticide resistance in these pests.
