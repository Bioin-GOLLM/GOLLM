Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally aggregated in neuronal and 
glial cells in a range of neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively 
referred to as tauopathies. Multiple studies have suggested that pathological 
tau species may act as a seed that promotes aggregation of endogenous tau in 
naïve cells and contributes to propagation of tau pathology. While they share 
pathological tau aggregation as a common feature, tauopathies are distinct from 
one another with respect to predominant tau isoforms that accumulate and the 
selective vulnerability of brain regions and cell types that have tau 
inclusions. For instance, primary tauopathies present with glial tau pathology, 
while it is mostly neuronal in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, morphologies of 
tau inclusions can greatly vary even within the same cell type, suggesting 
distinct mechanisms or distinct tau conformers in each tauopathy. 
Neuropathological heterogeneity across tauopathies challenges our understanding 
of pathophysiology behind tau seeding and aggregation, as well as our efforts to 
develop effective therapeutic strategies for AD and other tauopathies. In this 
review, we describe diverse neuropathological features of tau inclusions in 
neurodegenerative tauopathies and discuss what has been learned from 
experimental studies with mouse models, advanced transcriptomics, and 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on the biology underlying cell type-specific 
tau pathology.
