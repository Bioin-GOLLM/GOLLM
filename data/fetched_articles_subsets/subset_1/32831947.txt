The conclusions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer 
review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authorities 
of the rapporteur Member State, Austria, and co-rapporteur Member State, Malta, 
for the pesticide active substance abamectin are reported. The context of the 
peer review was that required by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 
No 844/2012, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/1659. 
The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the 
representative uses of abamectin as an insecticide and acaricide on tomato and 
strawberry. The reliable end points appropriate for use in regulatory risk 
assessment are presented. Missing information identified as being required by 
the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified.
