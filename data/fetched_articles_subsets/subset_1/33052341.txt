The interactions between antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 and immune cells contribute to 
the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and protective immunity. To understand the 
differences between antibody responses in mild versus severe cases of COVID-19, 
we analyzed the B cell responses in patients 1.5 months post SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Severe and not mild infection correlated with high titers of IgG 
against Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that were capable of viral 
inhibition. B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing revealed two VH genes, VH3-38 and 
VH3-53, that were enriched during severe infection. Of the 22 antibodies cloned 
from two severe donors, six exhibited potent neutralization against live 
SARS-CoV-2, and inhibited syncytia formation. Using peptide libraries, 
competition ELISA and RBD mutagenesis, we mapped the epitopes of the 
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) to three different sites on the Spike. Finally, 
we used combinations of nAbs targeting different immune-sites to efficiently 
block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of 49 healthy BCR repertoires revealed that 
the nAbs germline VHJH precursors comprise up to 2.7% of all VHJHs. We 
demonstrate that severe COVID-19 is associated with unique BCR signatures and 
multi-clonal neutralizing responses that are relatively frequent in the 
population. Moreover, our data support the use of combination antibody therapy 
to prevent and treat COVID-19.
