Exon deletion in the non-catalytic domain of eIF2Bepsilon due to a splice site 
mutation leads to infantile forms of CACH/VWM with severe decrease of eIF2B GEF 
activity.

The CACH/VWM syndrome is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy characterized by 
a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and by diffuse cavitary degeneration 
of the white matter on MRI. Mutations responsible for this disorder are missense 
or frameshift mutations occurring in the five genes (EIF2B1-5) that encode the 
translation eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2B. We found that a patient with 
infantile CACH/VWM carries a mutation in the acceptor splice site of EIF2B5 exon 
6. In lymphoblastoid cells of the patient, we detected an abnormal EIF2B5 
transcript in which exon 6 was absent, however, the predicted protein product 
lacking part of the non-catalytic domain encoded by exon 6 was not detected. The 
eIF2B GEF activity was severely decreased. These data support the importance of 
the non-catalytic domain of the eIF2Bepsilon subunit in the eIF2B complex 
formation and activity.
