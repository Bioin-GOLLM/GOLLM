Many endogenous and exogenous factors can induce genomic instability in human 
cells, in the form of DNA damage and mutations, that predispose them to cancer 
development. Normal cells rely on DNA damage bypass pathways such as translesion 
synthesis (TLS) and template switching (TS) to replicate past lesions that might 
otherwise result in prolonged replication stress and lethal double-strand breaks 
(DSBs). However, due to the lower fidelity of the specialized polymerases 
involved in TLS, the activation and suppression of these pathways must be 
tightly regulated by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination in 
order to limit the risk of mutagenesis. Many cancer cells rely on the 
deregulation of DNA damage bypass to promote carcinogenesis and tumor formation, 
often giving them heightened resistance to DNA damage from chemotherapeutic 
agents. In this review, we discuss the key functions of ubiquitin and 
ubiquitin-like proteins in regulating DNA damage bypass in human cells, and 
highlight ways in which these processes are both deregulated in cancer 
progression and might be targeted in cancer therapy.
