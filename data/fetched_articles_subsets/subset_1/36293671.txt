BACKGROUND: Free bilirubin (Bf) is a better marker than total serum bilirubin 
(TSB) for predicting bilirubin encephalopathy (BE). To date, two UGT1A1 genetic 
variants (rs4148323 and rs3064744) have been associated with neonatal 
hyperbilirubinemia; however, the direct association between UGT1A1 variants and 
Bf levels in newborns has not been elucidated.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 484 infants, including 
the genotype data of two UGT1A1 genetic variants. We divided the infants into a 
high Bf group (Bf ≥ 1.0 µg/dL, n = 77) and a non-high Bf group (Bf < 1.0 µg/dL, 
n = 407), based on the peak Bf values. Logistic regression analysis was 
performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for each variant allele compared to 
wild-type alleles.
RESULTS: The frequencies of the A allele in rs4148323 and (TA)7 allele in 
rs3064744 in the high Bf group (29% and 4%, respectively) were significantly 
different from those in the non-high Bf group (16% and 12%, respectively). In 
logistic regression analysis, for rs4148323, the A allele was significantly 
associated with an increased risk of hyper-free bilirubinemia over the G allele 
(adjusted OR: 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-2.72, p < 0.01). However, 
for rs3064744, the (TA)7 allele was significantly associated with a decreased 
risk of hyper-free bilirubinemia over the (TA)6 allele (adjusted OR: 0.42, 95% 
CI: 0.18-0.95, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show that the A allele in rs4148323 is a 
risk factor and that the (TA)7 allele in rs3064744 is a protective factor for 
developing hyper-free bilirubinemia in Japanese newborns.
