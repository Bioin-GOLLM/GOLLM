The GroEL/GroES chaperonin system assists the folding of many proteins, through 
conformational transitions driven by ATP hydrolysis. Although structural 
information about bullet-shaped GroEL:ES1 complexes has been extensively 
reported, the substrate interactions of another functional complex, the 
football-shaped GroEL:ES2, remain elusive. Here, we report single-particle 
cryo-EM structures of reconstituted wild-type GroEL:ES2 complexes with a 
chemically denatured substrate, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase 
(RuBisCO). Our structures demonstrate that native-like folded RuBisCO density is 
captured at the lower part of the GroEL chamber and that GroEL's bulky 
hydrophobic residues Phe281, Tyr360, and Phe44 contribute to direct contact with 
RuBisCO density. In addition, our analysis found that GroEL:ES2 can be occupied 
by two substrates simultaneously, one in each chamber. Together, these 
observations provide insights to the football-shaped GroEL:ES2 complex as a 
functional state to assist the substrate folding with visualization.
