Recent advances in genome editing with programmable nucleases have opened up new 
avenues for multiple applications, from basic research to clinical therapy. The 
ease of use of the technology-and particularly clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-will allow us to improve our understanding of 
genomic variation in disease processes via cellular and animal models. Here, we 
highlight the progress made in correcting gene mutations in monogenic hereditary 
disorders and discuss various CRISPR-associated applications, such as cancer 
research, synthetic biology, and gene therapy using induced pluripotent stem 
cells. The challenges, ethical issues, and future prospects of CRISPR-based 
systems for human research are also discussed.
