OBJECTIVE: Genetic factors play an important role in the development of 
asbestosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic 
polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) P1 represent a risk factor for 
this disease.
METHODS: The study population included 262 workers with asbestosis and 265 
matched controls. Information on cumulative asbestos exposure was available. A 
real-time PCR based on the 5' nuclease assay was designed for the analysis of 
GSTP1 Ile105Val and Ala114Val polymorphisms.
RESULTS: Asbestosis was associated with GSTP1 genotype coding for an enzyme with 
high conjugation capacity versus genotypes resulting in intermediate and low 
enzyme activity (odds ratio = 1.49, confidence interval = 1.06-2.10).
CONCLUSIONS: The key finding of the study was that GSTP1 genotype coding for an 
enzyme with high conjugation capacity significantly increases the risk of 
developing asbestosis.
