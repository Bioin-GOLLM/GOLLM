The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is a prevalent class of RNA binding domains. 
Although a number of RRM/RNA structures have been determined, thermodynamic 
analyses are relatively uncommon. Here, we use isothermal titration calorimetry 
to characterize single-stranded (ss)RNA binding by four representative 
RRM-containing proteins: (i) U2AF(65), (ii) SXL, (iii) TIA-1, and (iv) PAB. In 
all cases, ssRNA binding is accompanied by remarkably large favorable enthalpy 
changes (-30 to -60 kcal mol(-1)) and unfavorable entropy changes. Alterations 
of key RRM residues and binding sites indicate that under the nearly 
physiological conditions of these studies, large thermodynamic changes represent 
a signature of specific ssRNA recognition by RRMs.
