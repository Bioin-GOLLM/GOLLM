BACKGROUND: We report a case of a neonate with proximal spinal muscular atrophy 
(SMA) type 1 (also known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease or severe infantile acute 
SMA) associated with a Blake's pouch cyst; a malformation that is currently 
classified within the spectrum of Dandy-Walker complex. The association of the 
two conditions has not been previously reported in the English literature. A 
comprehensive review of the pertinent literature is presented.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A male neonate was noted to have paucity of movement of the 
four limbs with difficulty of breathing and poor feeding soon after birth. 
Respiratory distress with tachypnea, necessitated endotracheal intubation and 
mechanical ventilation. Pregnancy was uneventful except for decreased fetal 
movements reported by the mother during the third trimester. Neurological 
examination revealed generalized hypotonia with decreased muscle power of all 
limbs, nonelicitable deep tendon jerks, and occasional tongue fasciculations. 
Molecular genetic evaluation revealed a homozygous deletion of both exons 7 and 
8 of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, and exon 5 of the neuronal 
apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene on the long arm of chromosome 5 
consistent with Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (SMA type 1). At the age of 5 months, a 
full anterior fontanelle and abnormal increase of the occipito-frontal 
circumference were noted. Computed tomographic (CT) scan and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a tetraventricular hydrocephalus and 
features of Blake's pouch cyst of the fourth ventricle.
CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a previously unreported association of Blake's 
pouch cyst and SMA type 1.
