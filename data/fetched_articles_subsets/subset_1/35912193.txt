BACKGROUND: Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs) are indolent tumors 
with low-grade cytology. Although peritoneal dissemination is common due to 
tumor rupture and mucinous deposits on the visceral peritoneal surface, distant 
involvement, such as lung, is rarely seen due to lack of invasiveness.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 70-year-old woman presented to the hospital due to 
continuously elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels for 10 months 
without any symptoms. PET/CT revealed two lesions located in the left lung and 
appendix. The postoperative pathology results revealed pulmonary mucinous 
adenocarcinoma and LAMN. Then we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to 
clarify the relationship between the two tumors. The sequencing result showed 
that both tumors harbored the common tumor mutations, KRAS (p.G12D), GNAS 
(p.R201H), and BRAF (p.R735Q), which indicated that the pulmonary tumor was a 
metastasis of LAMN.
CONCLUSION: This case is unusual in that the primary LAMN and the pulmonary 
metastasis are present at the time of diagnosis. This study reported the first 
pulmonary metastasis from LAMN verified by NGS.
