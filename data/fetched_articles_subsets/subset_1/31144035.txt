Calcium-binding proteins are widely used to distinguish neuronal subsets in the 
brain. This study focuses on secretagogin, an EF-hand calcium sensor, to 
identify distinct neuronal populations in the brainstem of several vertebrate 
species. By using neural tube whole mounts of mouse embryos, we show that 
secretagogin is already expressed during the early ontogeny of brainstem 
noradrenaline cells. In adults, secretagogin-expressing neurons typically 
populate relay centres of special senses and vegetative regulatory centres of 
the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain. Notably, secretagogin expression 
overlapped with the brainstem column of noradrenergic cell bodies, including the 
locus coeruleus (A6) and the A1, A5 and A7 fields. Secretagogin expression in 
avian, mouse, rat and human samples showed quasi-equivalent patterns, suggesting 
conservation throughout vertebrate phylogeny. We found reduced secretagogin 
expression in locus coeruleus from subjects with Alzheimer's disease, and this 
reduction paralleled the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme rate limiting 
noradrenaline synthesis. Residual secretagogin immunoreactivity was confined to 
small submembrane domains associated with initial aberrant tau phosphorylation. 
In conclusion, we provide evidence that secretagogin is a useful marker to 
distinguish neuronal subsets in the brainstem, conserved throughout several 
species, and its altered expression may reflect cellular dysfunction of locus 
coeruleus neurons in Alzheimer's disease.
