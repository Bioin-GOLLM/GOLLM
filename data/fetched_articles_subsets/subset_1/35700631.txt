The phospholamban (PLN) R14del mutation is associated with arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular dysplasia (ARVD/C). ARVD/C is a cardiac disease characterized by 
arrhythmias and structural abnormalities in the right ventricle. Because PLN is 
a regulator of calcium release, this mutation can have deleterious effects on 
tissue integrity and contraction. This mutation is a trinucleotide (AGA) 
deletion that leads to an arginine deletion at position 14 of the PLN structure. 
Here we show two lines carrying this mutation with typical iPSC morphology, 
pluripotency, karyotype, ability to differentiate into the three germ layers in 
vitro, and readily availability for studying pathological mechanisms or ARVD/C.
