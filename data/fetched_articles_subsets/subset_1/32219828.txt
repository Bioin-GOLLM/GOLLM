OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular basis for a pedigree affected with 
coagulation factor V (FV) deficiency.
METHODS: Clinical data of the patient and his family members was analyzed. 
Targeted capture and next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing were 
carried out to detect potential variant of the FV gene.
RESULTS: The patient presented with jaundice and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) 
and activated partial thromboplastic time (APTT). V factor activity measured 
only 0.1% of the normal level, though the patient had no sign of bleeding. A 
paternal heterozygous variant c.653T>C (p.F218S) and a maternal heterozygous 
variant c.3642_3643del (p.P1215Rfs*175) were identified in the FV gene of the 
patient. His elder brother was a heterozygous carrier of the c.653T>C (p.F218S) 
variant. c.653T>C(p.F218S) was a known pathogenic variant, while the 
c.3642_3643del (p.P1215Rfs*175) variant was unreported previously.
CONCLUSION: Mutations of the FV gene probably underlie the hereditary 
coagulation factor V deficiency in this patient. NGS combined with Sanger 
sequencing has detected potential variant with efficiency and provided a 
reliable basis for clinical and prenatal diagnosis for this family.
