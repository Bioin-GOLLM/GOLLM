Activating KRAS mutations are found in over 90% of pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinomas (PDACs), yet KRAS has remained a difficult target to inhibit 
pharmacologically. Here, we demonstrate, using several human and mouse models of 
PDACs, rapid acquisition of tumor resistance in response to targeting KRAS or 
MEK, associated with integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-mediated increased 
phosphorylation of the mTORC2 component Rictor, and AKT. Although inhibition of 
mTORC1/2 results in a compensatory increase in ERK phosphorylation, 
combinatorial treatment of PDAC cells with either KRAS (G12C) or MEK inhibitors, 
together with mTORC1/2 inhibitors, results in synergistic cytotoxicity and cell 
death reflected by inhibition of pERK and pRictor/pAKT and of downstream 
regulators of protein synthesis and cell survival. Relative to single agents 
alone, this combination leads to durable inhibition of tumor growth and 
metastatic progression in vivo and increased survival. We have identified an 
effective combinatorial treatment strategy using clinically viable inhibitors, 
which can be applied to PDAC tumors with different KRAS mutations.
