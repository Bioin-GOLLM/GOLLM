OBJECTIVE: Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) plays a key role in regulating 
hepatic glucose production, but investigations of FOXO1 inhibition as a 
potential therapeutic approach have been hampered by a lack of selective 
chemical inhibitors. By profiling structurally diverse FOXO1 inhibitors, the 
current study validates FOXO1 as a viable target for the treatment of diabetes.
METHODS: Using reporter gene assays, hepatocyte gene expression studies, and in 
vivo studies in mice, we profiled our leading tool compound 10 and a previously 
characterized FOXO1 inhibitor, AS1842856 (AS).
RESULTS: We show that AS has significant FOXO1-independent effects, as 
demonstrated by testing in FOXO1-deficient cell lines and animals, while 
compound 10 is highly selective for FOXO1 both in vitro and in vivo and fails to 
elicit any effect in genetic models of FOXO1 ablation. Chronic administration of 
compound 10 improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control in db/db mice 
without causing weight gain. Furthermore, chronic compound 10 treatment combined 
with FGF21 led to synergistic glucose lowering in lean, streptozotocin-induced 
diabetic mice.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the widely used AS compound has substantial off-target 
activities and that compound 10 is a superior tool molecule for the 
investigation of FOXO1 function. In addition, we provide preclinical evidence 
that selective FOXO1 inhibition has potential therapeutic benefits for diabetes 
as a monotherapy or in combination with FGF21.
