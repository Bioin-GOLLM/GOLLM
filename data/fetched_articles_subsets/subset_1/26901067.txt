Plasmacytoid bladder cancer is an aggressive histologic variant with a high risk 
of disease-specific mortality. Using whole-exome and targeted sequencing, we 
find that truncating somatic alterations in the CDH1 gene occur in 84% of 
plasmacytoid carcinomas and are specific to this histologic variant. Consistent 
with the aggressive clinical behavior of plasmacytoid carcinomas, which 
frequently recur locally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDH1 in bladder 
cancer cells enhanced cell migration.
