BACKGROUND: MicroRNA (miRNA) polymorphisms may alter miRNA-related processes, 
and they likely contribute to cancer susceptibility. Various studies have 
investigated the associations between genetic variants in several key miRNAs and 
the risk of human cancers; however, few studies have focused on head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) risk. This study aimed to evaluate the 
associations between several key miRNA polymorphisms and HNSCC risk in a Chinese 
population.
METHODS: In this study, we genotyped five common single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in several key miRNAs (miR-149 rs2292832, miR-146a rs2910164, miR-605 
rs2043556, miR-608 rs4919510, and miR-196a2 rs11614913) and evaluated the 
associations between these SNPs and HNSCC risk according to cancer site with a 
case-control study including 576 cases and 1552 controls, which were matched by 
age and sex in a Chinese population.
RESULTS: The results revealed that miR-605 rs2043556 [dominant model: adjusted 
odds ratio (OR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.88; additive model: 
adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89] and miR-196a2 rs11614913 (dominant model: 
adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.08-1.72; additive model: adjusted OR 1.28, 95% CI 
1.10-1.48) were significantly associated with the risk of oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC). Furthermore, when these two loci were evaluated together based 
on the number of putative risk alleles (rs2043556 A and rs11614913 G), a 
significant locus-dosage effect was noted on the risk of OSCC (P trend < 0.001). 
However, no significant association was detected between the other three SNPs 
(miR-149 rs2292832, miR-146a rs2910164, and miR-608 rs4919510) and HNSCC risk.
CONCLUSION: Our study provided the evidence that miR-605 rs2043556 and miR-196a2 
rs11614913 may have an impact on genetic susceptibility to OSCC in Chinese 
population.
