BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR), aortic valve reintervention, particularly surgical TAVR valve 
explantation (TAVR explant), has not been well described.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through July 2021 to 
identify observational studies and case series reporting clinical outcomes of 
TAVR explant. Data on the frequency of TAVR explant, patient demographic 
characteristics, clinical indications, operative data, and perioperative 
outcomes were extracted. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group 
meta-analysis in a random-effects model.
RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were identified that included 1690 patients 
undergoing a TAVR explant. The frequency of TAVR explant among TAVR recipients 
was 0.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2%-0.6%). The mean patient age was 
73.7 years (95% CI, 72.9-74.6 years). The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons 
predicted risk of mortality was 5.9% (95% CI, 2.9%-8.8%) at the index TAVR and 
8.1% (95% CI, 5.4%-10.8%) at TAVR explant. The mean time from implant to explant 
was 345.0 days (95% CI, 196.7-493.3 days). Among patients with documented device 
type, 59.8% (95% CI, 43.5%-76.0%) had a balloon-expandable valve and 40.2% (95% 
CI, 24.0%-56.5%) had a self-expandable valve. Concomitant procedures during TAVR 
explant were performed in 52.9% of patients (95% CI, 33.8%-72.0%), and the most 
common concomitant procedure was aortic repair (28.5%; 95% CI, 14.0%-42.9%). The 
30-day mortality after TAVR explant was 16.7% (95% CI, 12.2%-21.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR explant in patients with a failing TAVR appears to be rare; 
however, the clinical impact of TAVR explant is substantial. Implanters must be 
mindful of the need for a lifetime management strategy in younger and lower-risk 
patients when choosing the valve type for the initial procedure.
