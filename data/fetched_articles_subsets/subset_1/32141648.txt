BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease, caused by mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection, which is associated with oxidative stress and the 
induction of host antioxidants to counteract this response. The heme oxygenase-1 
(HO-1) single nucleotide polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with 
many critical diseases. Our purpose was to investigate the association of HO-1 
single nucleotide polymorphisms with the susceptibility to tuberculosis in 
Chinese Han population.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed on Chinese Han population, and a 
group of 638 TB patients was compared to 610 healthy controls. Three single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs2071746, rs5995098, and rs8140669 
were genotyped using the MassARRAY platform. The genotype frequency was compared 
between TB patients and healthy controls. The association between the three 
genetic models of the three SNPs and TB risk was further investigated.
RESULTS: The results showed that, in the case of additive model, there was 
significant difference of the genotype frequencies of SNP rs8140669 between the 
TB patients and control groups (P = .038). In the case of dominant model, the 
genotype frequencies of SNP rs8140669 may have difference between the two 
cohorts (P = .051), while the allele frequency and genotype distribution for 
other two SNPs showed no significant difference between the two groups 
(P > .05).
CONCLUSION: HO-1 polymorphism was associated with TB susceptibility in Chinese 
Han population.
