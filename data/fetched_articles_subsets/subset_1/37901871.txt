Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is an inborn error of immunity 
(IEI) caused by a dominant-negative mutation in the signal transducer and 
activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3). This disease is characterized by chronic 
eczematoid dermatitis, recurrent staphylococcal skin abscesses, pneumonia, 
pneumatoceles, and extremely high serum IgE levels. Loss-of-function STAT3 
mutations may also result in distinct non-immunologic features such as dental, 
facial, skeletal, and vascular abnormalities, central nervous system 
malformations and an increased risk for bone fractures. Prophylactic treatment 
of Candida infections and prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for staphylococcal 
skin infections and sinopulmonary infections are essential. An awareness of the 
oral and maxillofacial features of HIES may facilitate early diagnosis with 
genetic counselling and may improve future patient care. This study describes 
oral, dental, and maxillofacial manifestations in 14 patients with genetically 
defined AD-HIES. We also review the literature and propose recommendations for 
the complex care of patients with this rare primary immunodeficiency.
