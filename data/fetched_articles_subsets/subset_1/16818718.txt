The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) coordinates mitotic progression with 
sister chromatid alignment. In mitosis, the checkpoint machinery accumulates at 
kinetochores, which are scaffolds devoted to microtubule capture. The checkpoint 
protein Mad2 (mitotic arrest deficient 2) adopts two conformations: open 
(O-Mad2) and closed (C-Mad2). C-Mad2 forms when Mad2 binds its checkpoint target 
Cdc20 or its kinetochore receptor Mad1. When unbound to these ligands, Mad2 
folds as O-Mad2. In HeLa cells, an essential interaction between C- and O-Mad2 
conformers allows Mad1-bound C-Mad2 to recruit cytosolic O-Mad2 to kinetochores. 
In this study, we show that the interaction of the O and C conformers of Mad2 is 
conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MAD2 mutant alleles impaired in this 
interaction fail to restore the SAC in a mad2 deletion strain. The corresponding 
mutant proteins bind Mad1 normally, but their ability to bind Cdc20 is 
dramatically impaired in vivo. Our biochemical and genetic evidence shows that 
the interaction of O- and C-Mad2 is essential for the SAC and is conserved in 
evolution.
