BACKGROUND: Urinary nitrogen leakage is an environmental concern in dairy 
cattle. Selection for reduced urinary nitrogen leakage may be done using 
indicator traits such as milk urea nitrogen (MUN). The result of a previous 
study indicated that the genetic correlation between MUN in Australia (AUS) and 
MUN in New Zealand (NZL) was only low to moderate (between 0.14 and 0.58). In 
this context, an alternative is to select sequence variants based on genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) with a view to improve genomic prediction accuracies. 
A GWAS can also be used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with 
MUN. Therefore, our objectives were to perform within-country GWAS and a 
meta-GWAS for MUN using records from up to 33,873 dairy cows and imputed 
whole-genome sequence data, to compare QTL detected in the GWAS for MUN in AUS 
and NZL, and to use sequence variants selected from the meta-GWAS to improve the 
prediction accuracy for MUN based on a joint AUS-NZL reference set.
RESULTS: Using the meta-GWAS, we detected 14 QTL for MUN, located on chromosomes 
1, 6, 11, 14, 19, 22, 26 and the X chromosome. The three most significant QTL 
encompassed the casein genes on chromosome 6, PAEP on chromosome 11 and DGAT1 on 
chromosome 14. We selected 50,000 sequence variants that had the same direction 
of effect for MUN in AUS and MUN in NZL and that were most significant in the 
meta-analysis for the GWAS. The selected sequence variants yielded a genetic 
correlation between MUN in AUS and MUN in NZL of 0.95 and substantially 
increased prediction accuracy in both countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate how the sharing of data between two 
countries can increase the power of a GWAS and increase the accuracy of genomic 
prediction using a multi-country reference population and sequence variants 
selected based on a meta-GWAS.
