Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous foodborne pathogen causing both invasive 
and non-invasive listeriosis. Sequence type (ST) 9 strains is common in food and 
food processing environments. In this study, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 
207 ST9 isolates from different sources, geographical locations (14 countries), 
and isolated years were analyzed. The ST9 isolates were divided into three 
clusters after phylogenetic analysis; 67.63% of ST9 isolates contained putative 
plasmids with different sizes and genomic structure, the putative prophages 
inserted in the chromosome at ten hotspots, and seven types of premature stop 
codon (PMSC) mutations in inlA were found in 81.86% of the ST9 isolates. In 
addition, 78.26% of ST9 isolates harbored Tn554-like elements carrying arsenic 
resistance genes. All the ST9 isolates conservatively contained 
environment-resistance genes on the chromosome. This analysis of population 
structures and features of ST9 isolates was aimed to help develop effective 
strategies to control this prevalent pathogen in the food chain.
