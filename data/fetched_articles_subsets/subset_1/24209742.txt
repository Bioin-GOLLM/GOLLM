The human protein PRR14 tethers heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina during 
interphase and mitotic exit.

The nuclear lamina is a protein meshwork that lies under the inner nuclear 
membrane of metazoan cells. One function of the nuclear lamina is to organize 
heterochromatin at the inner nuclear periphery. However, very little is known 
about how heterochromatin attaches to the nuclear lamina and how such 
attachments are restored at mitotic exit. Here, we show that a previously 
unstudied human protein, PRR14, functions to tether heterochromatin to the 
nuclear periphery during interphase, through associations with heterochromatin 
protein 1 (HP1) and the nuclear lamina. During early mitosis, PRR14 is released 
from the nuclear lamina and chromatin and remains soluble. Strikingly, at the 
onset of anaphase, PRR14 is incorporated rapidly into chromatin through HP1 
binding. Finally, in telophase, PRR14 relocalizes to the reforming nuclear 
lamina. This stepwise reassembly of PRR14 suggests a function in the selection 
of HP1-bound heterochromatin for reattachment to the nuclear lamina as cells 
exit mitosis.
