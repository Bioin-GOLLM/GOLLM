GRB2-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) has been identified as a crucial factor 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and ten common variants within GAB2 have been 
detected to be associated with AD onset risk in genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS). Here, we first screened a common locus (rs3740677) in 3' UTR of GAB2 
sequence which is targeted by the miRNA-185 and initiatively explored the 
probable associations of rs3740677 with risk for late-onset AD (LOAD) in a large 
scale case-control study from Chinese Han populations (992 LOAD patients and 
1358 healthy subjects). Eventually, the genotype (P = 0.024) and allele 
(P = 0.008) distribution of rs3740677 showed significant difference between LOAD 
and control group, and we observed a significant association of T allele in 
rs3740677 with LOAD risk in multivariate analysis and it decreased the risk for 
LOAD (dominant: OR = 0.831, 95 % CI = 0.702-0.983, P = 0.031; additive: 
OR = 0.855, 95 % CI = 0.745-0.983, P = 0.027) adjusted for age, gender, and APOE 
ε4 status. Our study further confirmed the association of GAB2 and AD. However, 
the absolute and correct association of rs3740677 with AD still required more 
investigations in diverse regions and ethnics.
