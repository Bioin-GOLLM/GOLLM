Amelogenesis imperfectas (AI) are a group of inherited defects of dental enamel 
formation that show both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Seven Turkish 
families segregating autosomal recessive AI (ARAI) were evaluated for evidence 
of a genetic etiology of AI for the seven major candidate gene loci (AMBN, 
AMELX, ENAM, FAM83H, KLK4, MMP20, and TUFT1). Dental and periodontal 
characteristics of the affected members of these families were also described. 
The mean scores of DMFS and dfs indices were 9.7 and 9.6, respectively. The mean 
PPD was 2.2 mm and the percentage of the sites with plaque and BOP were 87.8% 
and 72.4%, respectively. The exons and intron/exon junctions of the candidate 
genes were sequenced and no gene mutations were identified in any individuals. 
These findings support the existence of an additional gene(s) that are etiologic 
for ARAI in these families.
