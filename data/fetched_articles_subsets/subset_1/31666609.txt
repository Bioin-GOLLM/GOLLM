An Argonaute (AGO) protein within the RNA-induced silencing complex binds a 
microRNA, permitting the target mRNA to be silenced. We hypothesized that 
variations in AGO genes had the possibility including affected the miRNA 
function and associated with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) susceptibility. 
Especially, we were chosen the AGO1 (rs595961, rs636832) and AGO2 (rs2292779, 
rs4961280) polymorphisms because of those polymorphisms have already reported in 
other diseases excluding the RPL. Here, we conducted a case-control study (385 
RPL patients and 246 controls) to evaluate the association of four polymorphisms 
with RPL. We found that the AGO1 rs595961 AA genotype, recessive model 
(P = 0.039; P = 0.043, respectively), the AGO1 rs636832 GG genotype, and 
recessive model (P = 0.037; P = 0.016, respectively) were associated with RPL in 
women who had had four or more consecutive pregnancy losses. The patients with 
the AGO1 rs636832 GG genotypes had greater platelet counts (P = 0.023), while 
the patients with the AGO2 rs4961280 CA genotypes had less homocysteine 
(P = 0.027). Based on these results, we propose that genetic variations with 
respect to the AGO1 and AGO2 genotypes are associated with risk for RPL, and 
might serve as useful biomarkers for the prognosis of RPL.
