Growing evidence indicates important roles for astrocytes in neurodevelopment 
and diseases. However, astrocytes and their roles in these processes remain 
poorly understood. Despite recent progress in reprogramming somatic cells into 
different types of neural cells, reprogramming to astrocytes has lagged. Here, 
we show that functional astrocytes can be generated from mammalian fibroblasts 
using only small molecules. Induced mouse astrocytes resemble primary astrocytes 
in astrocytic gene expression and epigenomic status and exhibit functional 
properties in promoting neuronal maturation, glutamate uptake, and calcium 
signaling. Moreover, these cells can recapitulate the Alexander disease 
phenotype of protein aggregation when expressing Gfap with a disease-causing 
mutation. The same compounds can also reprogram human fibroblasts into 
astroglial progenitor cells that can further mature into functional astrocytes. 
These chemically induced astrocytes may provide cellular models to uncover roles 
of astrocytes in normal neurodevelopment and pathogenesis of neurological 
diseases.
