Small molecules have been used since antiquity to regulate our sleep. Despite 
the explosion of diverse drugs to treat problems of too much or too little 
sleep, the detailed mechanisms of action and especially the neuronal targets by 
which these compounds alter human behavioural states are not well understood. 
Research efforts in model systems such as mouse, zebrafish and fruit fly are 
combining conditional genetics and optogenetics with pharmacology to map the 
effects of sleep-promoting drugs onto neural circuits. Recent studies raise the 
possibility that many small molecules alter sleep and wake via specific sets of 
critical neurons rather than through the global modulation of multiple brain 
targets. These findings also uncover novel brain areas as sleep/wake regulators 
and indicate that the development of circuit-selective drugs might alleviate 
sleep disorders with fewer side effects.
