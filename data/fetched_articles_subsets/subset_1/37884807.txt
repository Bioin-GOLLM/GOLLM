Targeting proximity-labeling enzymes to specific cellular locations is a viable 
strategy for profiling subcellular proteomes. Here, we generated transgenic mice 
(MAX-Tg) expressing a mitochondrial matrix-targeted ascorbate peroxidase. 
Comparative analysis of matrix proteomes from the muscle tissues showed 
differential enrichment of mitochondrial proteins. We found that reticulon 
4-interacting protein 1 (RTN4IP1), also known as optic atrophy-10, is enriched 
in the mitochondrial matrix of muscle tissues and is an NADPH oxidoreductase. 
Interactome analysis and in vitro enzymatic assays revealed an essential role 
for RTN4IP1 in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis by regulating the O-methylation 
activity of COQ3. Rtn4ip1-knockout myoblasts had markedly decreased CoQ9 levels 
and impaired cellular respiration. Furthermore, muscle-specific knockdown of 
dRtn4ip1 in flies resulted in impaired muscle function, which was reversed by 
dietary supplementation with soluble CoQ. Collectively, these results 
demonstrate that RTN4IP1 is a mitochondrial NAD(P)H oxidoreductase essential for 
supporting mitochondrial respiration activity in the muscle tissue.
