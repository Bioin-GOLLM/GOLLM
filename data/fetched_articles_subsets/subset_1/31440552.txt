In this paper, we present the allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of 4 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LIN28B gene (rs4946651, rs7759938, 
rs314280, rs314276) in a sample of Russian women. These SNPs had been previously 
identified to be associated with age at menarche in genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS). The information about age at menarche was obtained using the 
questionnaire. The frequencies of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes of four SNPs 
were classified in 3 groups: the whole sample, individuals with the early age at 
menarche (<12 years), and those with the average age at menarche (12-14 years).
