Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported to be involved in many diseases. But 
there is no report on circRNAs in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). The purpose 
of this paper is to explore the circular RNA expression profile and potential 
functions of circRNAs in NOA patients. We first preformed circRNA expression 
profiling analysis using a circRNA microarray in testicular samples from NOA and 
obstructive azoospermia (OA) patients. CircRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. 
Bioinformatics analysis were used to construct the ceRNA network. GO and KEGG 
enrichment analysis were performed by using DAVID. Microarray analysis 
identified 82 differentially expressed circRNAs in NOA specimens. The 
differential expression of hsa_circRNA_402130, hsa_circRNA_072697, 
hsa_circRNA_030050, hsa_circRNA_100812 and hsa_circRNA_406168 was confirmed by 
qRT-PCR. Enrichment analysis revealed the association of hsa_circRNA_402130 and 
hsa_circRNA_072697 with multiple signaling pathways. The data indicated that 
circRNAs were significantly dysregulated in NOA specimens and might involve in 
the pathogenesis of NOA.
