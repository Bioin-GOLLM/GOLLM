To better understand the molecular mechanisms and genetic basis of human 
disease, we systematically examine relationships between 3,949 genes, 62,663 
mutations and 3,453 associated disorders by generating a three-dimensional, 
structurally resolved human interactome. This network consists of 4,222 
high-quality binary protein-protein interactions with their atomic-resolution 
interfaces. We find that in-frame mutations (missense point mutations and 
in-frame insertions and deletions) are enriched on the interaction interfaces of 
proteins associated with the corresponding disorders, and that the disease 
specificity for different mutations of the same gene can be explained by their 
location within an interface. We also predict 292 candidate genes for 694 
unknown disease-to-gene associations with proposed molecular mechanism 
hypotheses. This work indicates that knowledge of how in-frame disease mutations 
alter specific interactions is critical to understanding pathogenesis. 
Structurally resolved interaction networks should be valuable tools for 
interpreting the wealth of data being generated by large-scale structural 
genomics and disease association studies.
