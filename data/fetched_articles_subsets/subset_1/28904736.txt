Beer is one of the most frequently consumed fermented beverages in the world, 
and it has been part of the human diet for thousands of years. Scientific 
evidence obtained from the development of new techniques of food analysis over 
the last two decades suggests that polyphenol intake derived from moderate beer 
consumption may play a positive role in different health outcomes including 
osteoporosis and cardiovascular risk and the relief of vasomotor symptoms, which 
are commonly experienced during menopause and are an important reason why women 
seek medical care during this period; here, we review the current knowledge 
regarding moderate beer consumption and its possible effects on menopausal 
symptoms. The effect of polyphenol intake on vasomotor symptoms in menopause may 
be driven by the direct interaction of the phenolic compounds present in beer, 
such as 8-prenylnaringenin, 6-prenylnaringenin, and isoxanthohumol, with 
intracellular estrogen receptors that leads to the modulation of gene 
expression, increase in sex hormone plasma concentrations, and thus modulation 
of physiological hormone imbalance in menopausal women. Since traditional 
hormone replacement therapies increase health risks, alternative, safer 
treatment options are needed to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women. The 
present work aims to review the current data on this subject.
