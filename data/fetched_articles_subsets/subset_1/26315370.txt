Cluster of Differentiation-200 (CD200) is an anti-inflammatory glycoprotein 
expressed in neurons, T cells, and B cells, and its receptor is expressed on 
glia. Both Alzheimer's disease patients and mouse models display age-related or 
amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)-induced reductions in CD200. The goal of this study was 
to determine if neuronal CD200 expression restores hippocampal neurogenesis and 
reduces Aβ in the amyloid precursor protein mouse model. Amyloid precursor 
protein and wild-type mice were injected at 6 months of age with an 
adeno-associated virus expressing CD200 into the hippocampus and sacrificed at 
12 months. CD200 expression restored neural progenitor cell proliferation and 
differentiation in the subgranular and granular cell layers of the dentate gyrus 
and reduced diffuse but not thioflavin-S(+) plaques in the hippocampus. In vitro 
studies demonstrated that CD200-stimulated microglia increased neural 
differentiation of neural stem cells and enhanced axon elongation and dendrite 
number. CD200 also enhanced Aβ uptake by microglia. These data indicate that 
CD200 is capable of enhancing microglia-mediated Aβ clearance and neural 
differentiation and has potential as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.
