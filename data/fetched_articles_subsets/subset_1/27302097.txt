Myhre syndrome is a rare, distinctive syndrome due to specific gain-of-function 
mutations in SMAD4. The characteristic phenotype includes short stature, 
dysmorphic facial features, hearing loss, laryngotracheal anomalies, 
arthropathy, radiographic defects, intellectual disability, and a more recently 
appreciated spectrum of cardiovascular defects with a striking 
fibroproliferative response to surgical intervention. We report four newly 
described patients with typical features of Myhre syndrome who had (i) a mildly 
narrow descending aorta and restrictive cardiomyopathy; (ii) recurrent 
pericardial and pleural effusions; (iii) a large persistent ductus arteriosus 
with juxtaductal aortic coarctation; and (iv) restrictive pericardial disease 
requiring pericardiectomy. Additional information is provided about a fifth 
previously reported patient with fatal pericardial disease. A literature review 
of the cardiovascular features of Myhre syndrome was performed on 54 total 
patients, all with a SMAD4 mutation. Seventy percent had a cardiovascular 
abnormality including congenital heart defects (63%), pericardial disease (17%), 
restrictive cardiomyopathy (9%), and systemic hypertension (15%). Pericarditis 
and restrictive cardiomyopathy are associated with high mortality (three 
patients each among 10 deaths); one patient with restrictive cardiomyopathy also 
had epicarditis. Cardiomyopathy and pericardial abnormalities distinguish Myhre 
syndrome from other disorders caused by mutations in the TGF-β signaling cascade 
(Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, or Shprintzen-Goldberg syndromes). We hypothesize that the 
expanded spectrum of cardiovascular abnormalities relates to the ability of the 
SMAD4 protein to integrate diverse signaling pathways, including canonical 
TGF-β, BMP, and Activin signaling. The co-occurrence of congenital and acquired 
phenotypes demonstrates that the gene product of SMAD4 is required for both 
developmental and postnatal cardiovascular homeostasis. © 2016 Wiley
