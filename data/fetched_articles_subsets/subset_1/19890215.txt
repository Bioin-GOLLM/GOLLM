BACKGROUND: The objective of this research was to identify the impact of genetic 
variants of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) on nelfinavir 
pharmacokinetics and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 
HIV-1-infected children.
METHODS: HIV-1-infected children (n = 152) from Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial 
Group 366 or 377 receiving nelfinavir as a component of HAART were evaluated. 
Genomic DNA was assayed for ABCB1 and CYP genetic variants using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction Nelfinavir oral clearance (CL/F), M8 to nelfinavir 
ratios, CD4 T cells, and HIV-1-RNA were measured during HAART.
RESULTS: Nelfinavir CL/F and M8 to nelfinavir ratios were significantly 
associated with the CYP2C19-G681A genotypes (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the 
CYP2C19-G681A genotype was related to virologic responses at week 24 (P = 0.01). 
A multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (P = 0.03), concomitant protease 
inhibitor use (P < 0.001), and the CYP2C19-G681A genotype (P < 0.001) remained 
significant covariates associated with nelfinavir CL/F.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP2C19 genotypes altered nelfinavir pharmacokinetics and the 
virologic response to HAART in HIV-1-infected children. These findings suggest 
that CYP2C19 genotypes are important determinants of nelfinavir pharmacokinetics 
and virologic response in HIV-1-infected children.
