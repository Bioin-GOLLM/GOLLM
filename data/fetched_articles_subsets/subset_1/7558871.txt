Several members of a large Caucasian family who presented with a congenital 
Heinz body hemolytic anemia were found to be carriers of the unstable Hb Bibba 
or alpha 2 136(H19)Leu-->Pro beta 2. Identification by protein analysis was 
hampered by the instability of the variant which complicated its isolation from 
shipped blood samples. Moreover, the detection of the CTG-->CCG mutation at 
codon 136 of the alpha 2 gene required the substitution of dGTP by dITP during 
the DNA sequencing process to prevent the occurrence of secondary structures and 
compressions in the sequencing gel. The first Hb Bibba heterozygote, 
characterized in 1968 (1), is believed to be a member of this family. The 
clinical expression of the disease is surprisingly variable.
