Functional outcomes with neural prosthetic devices, such as cochlear implants, 
are limited in part due to physical separation between the stimulating elements 
and the neurons they stimulate. One strategy to close this gap aims to precisely 
guide neurite regeneration to position the neurites in closer proximity to 
electrode arrays. Here, we explore the ability of micropatterned biochemical and 
topographic guidance cues, singly and in combination, to direct the growth of 
spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) neurites, the neurons targeted by cochlear 
implants. Photopolymerization of methacrylate monomers was used to form 
unidirectional topographical features of ridges and grooves in addition to 
multidirectional patterns with 90o angle turns. Microcontact printing was also 
used to create similar uni- and multi-directional patterns of peptides on 
polymer surfaces. Biochemical cues included peptides that facilitate (laminin, 
LN) or repel (EphA4-Fc) neurite growth. On flat surfaces, SGN neurites 
preferentially grew on LN-coated stripes and avoided EphA4-Fc-coated stripes. LN 
or EphA4-Fc was selectively adsorbed onto the ridges or grooves to test the 
neurite response to a combination of topographical and biochemical cues. Coating 
the ridges with EphA4-Fc and grooves with LN lead to enhanced SGN alignment to 
topographical patterns. Conversely, EphA4-Fc coating on the grooves or LN 
coating on the ridges tended to disrupt alignment to topographical patterns. SGN 
neurites respond to combinations of topographical and biochemical cues and 
surface patterning that leverages both cues enhance guided neurite growth.
