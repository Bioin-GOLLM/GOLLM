In order to obtain a metabolically more stable analgesic peptide derivative, 
O-beta-glycosylated serine (Ser(Glc)) was introduced into TY027 
(Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe-Met-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-3',5'-Bzl(CF(3))(2)) which was a 
previously reported bifunctional compound with delta/micro opioid agonist and 
neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist activities and with a half-life of 4.8 h in rat 
plasma. Incorporation of Ser(Glc) into various positions of TY027 gave analogues 
with variable bioactivities. Analogue 6 
(Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe-Nle-Pro-Leu-Ser(Glc)-Trp-NH-3',5'-Bzl(CF(3))(2)) was found to 
have effective bifunctional activities with a well-defined conformation with two 
beta-turns based on the NMR conformational analysis in the presence of DPC 
micelles. In addition, 6 showed significant improvement in its metabolic 
stability (70 + or - 9% of 6 was intact after 24 h incubation in rat plasma). 
This improved metabolic stability, along with its effective and delta selective 
bifunctional activities, suggests that 6 could be an interesting research tool 
and possibly a promising candidate as a novel analgesic drug.
