Oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases including anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
are implicated in numerous solid and hematologic cancers. ALK mutations are 
reported in an estimated 9% of neuroblastoma and recent reports indicate that 
the percentage of ALK-positive cases increases in the relapsed patient 
population. Initial clinical trial results have shown that it is difficult to 
inhibit growth of ALK positive neuroblastoma with crizotinib, motivating 
investigation of next generation ALK inhibitors with higher affinity for ALK. 
Here, alectinib, a potent next generation ALK inhibitor with antitumor activity 
was investigated in ALK-driven neuroblastoma models. Employing neuroblastoma 
cell lines and mouse xenografts we show a clear and efficient inhibition of ALK 
activity by alectinib. Inhibition of ALK activity was observed in vitro 
employing a set of different constitutively active ALK variants in biochemical 
assays. The results suggest that alectinib is an effective inhibitor of ALK 
kinase activity in ALK addicted neuroblastoma and should be considered as a 
potential future therapeutic option for ALK-positive neuroblastoma patients 
alone or in combination with other treatments.
