BACKGROUND: Anemia is a frequent finding in cancer patients. Pre-treatment 
anemia is known to be associated with poor survival after surgery or 
stereotactic body radiation therapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
However, little study was conducted in NSCLC with activating epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations.
METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective study conducted in seven 
university teaching hospitals in the Republic of Korea from January 2009 to 
February 2016. A total of 290 patients were diagnosed with NSCLC harboring 
sensitizing EGFR mutations and treated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) 
as 1st line. Of these patients, 104 met the exclusion criteria. Pre-treatment 
anemia was defined according to World Health Organization criteria (Hb 
concentration <13 g/dL for men and <12 g/dL for women).
RESULTS: A total of 186 patients were finally included for analysis. Of these 
patients, 86 (46.2%) and 100 (53.8%) patients were classified into anemia and 
non-anemia groups, respectively. The anemia group had shorter median overall 
survival (OS) than the non-anemia group [24.83 (95% CI, 17.49-32.17) months vs. 
42.10 (95% CI, 31.87-52.34) months, P=0.031]. In multivariate analysis, anemia 
(aHR, 2.573; 95% CI, 1.122-5.901; P=0.026) was only independent factors for poor 
OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pre-treatment anemia is a significant poor 
prognostic factor for OS of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations treated with 
EGFR-TKI.
