We describe two unrelated patients, both heterozygous for an unstable hemoglobin 
(Hb) variant named Hb Calgary (HBB: c.194G>T) that causes severe hemolytic 
anemia and dyserythorpoietic, resulting in transfusion dependence and iron 
overload. The molecular pathogenesis is a missense variation on the β-globin 
gene, presumed to lead to an unstable Hb. The phenotype of Hb Calgary is 
particularly severe presenting as transfusion-dependent anemia in early infancy, 
precluding phenotypic diagnosis and highlighting the importance of early genetic 
testing in order to make an accurate diagnosis.
