Objective: To explore the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, therapy, and 
mechanism of hemichorea associated with non-ketotic hyperglycemia (HC-NH) so as 
to enhance awareness and avoid misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis of the disease. 
Methods: A case of HC-NH was reported and reviewed in terms of the clinical 
features, diagnosis and treatment. Results: Hemichorea associated with 
non-ketotic hyperglycemia is a rare complication of diabetes mellitus, which is 
commonly seen in elderly women with poorly-controlled diabetes. The condition is 
characterized by non-ketotic hyperglycemia, unilateral involuntary choreiform 
movements, and contralateral basal ganglia hyper-intensity by T1-weighted MR 
imaging or high density on CT scans. Blood glucose control is the basal 
treatment, in combination with dopamine receptor antagonists and benzodiazepine 
sedative, in controlling hemichorea. Conclusion: In clinical practice, the 
possibility of unilateral chorea should be considered for diabetic patients with 
poor blood glucose control.
