Multiprotein adsorption of hen egg white lysozyme at a model charged ionic 
surface is studied using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. 
Simulations with two, three, and five proteins, in various orientations with 
respect the surface, are performed over a 100 ns time scale. Mutated proteins 
with point mutations at the major (Arg128 and Arg125) and minor (Arg68) surface 
adsorption sites are also studied. The 100 ns time scale used is sufficient to 
observe protein translations, rotations, adsorption, and aggregation. Two 
competing processes of particular interest are observed, namely surface 
adsorption and protein-protein aggregation. At low protein concentration, the 
proteins first adsorb in isolation and can then reorientate on the surface to 
aggregate. At high concentration, the proteins aggregate in the solution and 
then adsorb in nonspecific ways. This work demonstrates the role of protein 
concentration in adsorption, indicates the residues involved in both types of 
interaction (protein-protein and protein-surface), and gives an insight into 
processes to be considered in the development of new functionalized material 
systems.
