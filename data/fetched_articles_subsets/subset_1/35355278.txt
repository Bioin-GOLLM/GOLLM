Furin is a protease that plays a key role in the infection cycle of SARS-CoV-2 
by cleaving the viral proteins during the virus particle assembly. In addition, 
Furin regulates several physiological processes related to cardio-metabolic 
traits. DNA variants in the FURIN gene are candidates to regulate the risk of 
developing these traits as well as the susceptibility to severe COVID-19. We 
genotyped two functional FURIN variants (rs6224/rs4702) in 428 COVID-19 patients 
in the intensive care unit. The association with death (N = 106) and 
hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia was statistically evaluated. The 
risk of death was associated with age, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. 
The two FURIN alleles linked to higher expression (rs6224 T and rs4702 A) were 
significantly increased in the death cases (odds ratio= 1.40 and 1.43). 
Homozygosis for the two high expression genotypes (rs6224 TT and rs4702 AA) and 
for the T-A haplotype was associated with an increased risk of 
hypercholesterolemia. In the multiple logistic regression both, 
hypercholesterolemia and the TT + AA genotype were significantly associated with 
death. In conclusion, besides its association with hypercholesterolemia, FURIN 
variants might be independent risk factors for the risk of death among COVID-19 
patients.
