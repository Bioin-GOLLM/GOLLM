Tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells is, in part, 
attributable to their undifferentiated (neural stem cell-like) phenotype. 
Astrocytic differentiation of GBM cells is associated with transcriptional 
induction of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and repression of Nestin, 
whereas the reciprocal transcription program operates in undifferentiated GBM 
cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of these transcription 
programs remain elusive. Here, we show that the transcriptional co-activator 
p300 was expressed in GBM tumors and cell lines and acted as an activator of the 
GFAP gene and a repressor of the Nestin gene. On the other hand, Myc (formerly 
known as c-Myc overrode these p300 functions by repressing the GFAP gene and 
inducing the Nestin gene in GBM cells. Moreover, RNAi-mediated inhibition of 
p300 expression significantly enhanced the invasion potential of GBM cells in 
vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that dedifferentiated/undifferentiated 
GBM cells are more invasive than differentiated GBM cells. Because invasion is a 
major cause of GBM morbidity, differentiation therapy may improve the clinical 
outcome.
