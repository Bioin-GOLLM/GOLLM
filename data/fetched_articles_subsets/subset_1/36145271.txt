Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase 
involved in diverse fundamental cellular processes such as apoptosis and 
autophagy. DAPK1 isoform plays an essential role as a tumor suppressor and 
inhibitor of metastasis. Consequently, DAPK1 became a promising target protein 
for developing new anti-cancer agents. In this work, we present the rational 
design and complete synthetic routes of a novel series of eighteen aryl 
carboxamide derivatives as potential DAPK1 inhibitors. Using a custom panel of 
forty-five kinases, a single dose of 10 µM of the picolinamide derivative 4a was 
able to selectively inhibit DAPK1 kinase by 44.19%. Further investigations 
revealed the isonicotinamide derivative 4q as a promising DAPK1 inhibitory lead 
compound with an IC50 value of 1.09 µM. In an in vitro anticancer activity assay 
using a library of 60 cancer cell lines including blood, lung, colon, CNS, skin, 
ovary, renal, prostate, and breast cancers, four compounds (4d, 4e, 4o, and 4p) 
demonstrated high anti-proliferative activity with mean % GI ~70%. Furthermore, 
the most potent DAPK1 inhibitor (4q) exhibited remarkable activity against 
leukemia (K-562) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) with % GI of 72% and 75%, 
respectively.
