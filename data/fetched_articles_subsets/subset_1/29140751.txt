Biallelic HMX1 mutations cause a very rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder 
termed as oculoauricular syndrome (OAS) because it is characterized only by the 
combination of eye and ear anomalies. We identified a new family bringing to 
three the total families reported with this disorder. Our proband presented with 
anteriorly protruded ears and malformed ear pinnae in association with 
microphthalmia, congenital cataract, microcornea, and iris and optic disc 
colobomata. Additionally, he had high and broad forehead with asymmetry giving a 
recognizable facial gestalt. Further, short left mandibular ramus and bifid 
cingulum in the boy and short right mandibular ramus in his father were 
observed. Mutation analysis revealed a novel homozygous nonsense mutation 
c.487G>T in the second exon of the HMX1 that predicted to introduce a premature 
stop codon at position 163 (p.E163*). Parents showed the heterozygous state of 
the detected mutation. Investigations in a process as complex as craniofacial 
development suggest that there are still additional, as yet unidentified, genes 
that play in orchestrate to determine the final phenotype.
