The DNA damage response involves a complex network of processes that detect and 
repair DNA damage. Here we show that miRNA biogenesis is globally induced upon 
DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner. About one-fourth of miRNAs are 
significantly upregulated after DNA damage, while loss of ATM abolishes their 
induction. KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) is a key player that 
translates DNA damage signaling to miRNA biogenesis. The ATM kinase directly 
binds to and phosphorylates KSRP, leading to enhanced interaction between KSRP 
and pri-miRNAs and increased KSRP activity in miRNA processing. Mutations of the 
ATM phosphorylation sites of KSRP impaired its activity in regulating miRNAs. 
These findings reveal a mechanism by which DNA damage signaling is linked to 
miRNA biogenesis.
