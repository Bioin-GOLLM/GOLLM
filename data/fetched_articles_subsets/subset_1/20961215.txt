PURPOSE: To analyze the genotype distributions and allele frequencies for ROCK2 
Thr431Asn and Arg83Lys polymorphisms among the diabetic retinopathy patients in 
a Turkish population.
METHODS: In this case-control study, 335 patients with diabetes mellitus were 
recruited and divided into three groups according to non-proliferative 
(n = 127), proliferative (n = 85) diabetic retinopathy, and no retinopathy 
(n = 123, served as a diabetic control group). Genomic DNA from the patients, 
and the nondiabetic healthy control cases (n = 132) was analyzed by real-time 
PCR using a Light-Cycler.
RESULTS: Neither genotype distributions nor the allele frequencies for the 
Thr431Asn or Arg83Lys polymorphisms showed a significant difference between the 
groups. The haplotypes were also not significantly associated with diabetic 
retinopathy.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there were no evidence for an association 
of ROCK2 gene Thr431Asn and Arg83Lys polymorphisms with diabetes or diabetic 
retinopathy in the Turkish population.
