The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) output state for NO production is a complex of 
the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding domain and the heme domain, and thereby 
it facilitates the interdomain electron transfer from the FMN to the catalytic 
heme site. Emerging evidence suggests that interdomain FMN-heme interactions are 
important in the formation of the output state because they guide the docking of 
the FMN domain to the heme domain. In this study, notable effects of mutations 
in the adjacent FMN domain on the heme structure in a human iNOS bidomain 
oxygenase/FMN construct have been observed by using low-temperature magnetic 
circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. The comparative MCD study of wild-type 
and mutant proteins clearly indicates that a properly docked FMN domain 
contributes to the observed L-Arg perturbation of the heme MCD spectrum in the 
wild-type protein and that the conserved surface residues in the FMN domain 
(E546 and E603) play key roles in facilitating a productive alignment of the FMN 
and heme domains in iNOS.
