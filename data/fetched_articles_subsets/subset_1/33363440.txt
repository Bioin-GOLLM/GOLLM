Extensive testing of populations against COVID-19 has been suggested as a 
game-changer quest to control the spread of this contagious disease and to avoid 
further disruption in our social, healthcare and economical systems. 
Nonetheless, testing millions of people for a new virus brings about quite a few 
challenges. The development of effective tests for the new coronavirus has 
become a worldwide task that relies on recent discoveries and lessons learned 
from past outbreaks. In this work, we review the most recent publications on 
microfluidics devices for the detection of viruses. The topics of discussion 
include different detection approaches, methods of signalling and fabrication 
techniques. Besides the miniaturization of traditional benchtop detection 
assays, approaches such as electrochemical analyses, field-effect transistors 
and resistive pulse sensors are considered. For emergency fabrication of quick 
test kits, the local capabilities must be evaluated, and the joint work of 
universities, industries, and governments seems to be an unequivocal necessity.
