Paraganglioma (PGL) is a rare tumor originating from extra-adrenal 
paraganglionic chromaffin tissues, and most sympathetic PGLs have excessive 
catecholamine secretion. However, nonfunctional PGLs are sometimes found. 
Although malignant PGL is defined by metastasis to nonchromaffin tissues, it is 
difficult to predict malignancies due to the lack of reliable markers of 
potential malignancies. We report the case of a 69-year-old Japanese woman with 
an incidental retroperitoneal tumor and multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes 
simultaneously. The patient had no subjective symptoms and there were no 
laboratory findings suggesting catecholamine hypersecretion. Both the 
retroperitoneal tumor and the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes showed high 
accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), whereas metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) 
was accumulated only at the retroperitoneal tumor. Although a retroperitoneal 
tumor was diagnosed as nonfunctional PGL by examination including MIBG 
scintigraphy, the cause of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes could not be 
diagnosed by imaging and biochemical tests. As a result of retroperitoneal tumor 
resection and mesenteric lymph nodes sampling, histopathological examination 
revealed that a retroperitoneal tumor was PGL and enlarged mesenteric lymph 
nodes were follicular lymphoma. To reveal an underlying genetic factor, we 
performed whole exome sequencing of genomic DNA, and we identified 2 possible 
candidate variants in SDHD and DLST, but the pathogenicity of these variants 
remains uncertain in the present case. This rare case reinforces the importance 
of histopathological diagnosis of nonchromaffin tissue lesions in patients with 
PGL for the appropriate treatment strategy.
