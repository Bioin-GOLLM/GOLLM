BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac remodeling with the 
underlying mechanisms involving inflammation and fibrosis has been well 
documented. Cytosolic adaptor caspase recruitment domain 9 (CARD9) has been 
implicated in the innate immune response. We aimed to examine the role of CARD9 
in inflammation and cardiac fibrosis induced by Ang II.
METHODS: Two-month-old CARD9-deficient (CARD9(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) male mice 
were infused with Ang II (1,500 ng/kg/min) or saline for 7 days. Heart sections 
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome and examined by 
immunohistochemistry; and activity and protein levels were measured in 
macrophages obtained from mice.
RESULTS: WT mice with Ang II infusion showed a marked increase in CARD9(+) 
macrophages in the heart, but CARD9(-/-) mice showed significantly suppressed 
macrophage infiltration and expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including 
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Importantly, 
Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis (extracellular matrix and collagen I deposition) 
was diminished in CARD9(-/-) hearts, as was the expression of transforming 
growth factor-β (TGF-β) and level of myofibroblasts positive for α-smooth muscle 
actin (α-SMA). Furthermore, Ang II activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), JNK 
and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in WT macrophages was reduced 
in CARD9(-/-) macrophages.
CONCLUSION: CARD9 plays an important role in regulating cardiac inflammation and 
fibrosis in response to elevated Ang II.
