INTRODUCTION: Lazertinib is an irreversible, mutant-selective epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Co-administration of 
TKIs with acid-reducing agents (ARAs) can lead to potential drug-drug 
interactions, which decreases solubility and absorption of TKIs and is 
ultimately associated with reduced efficacy of TKIs. This retrospective analysis 
evaluated the effect of ARAs on the pharmacokinetics of lazertinib using data 
obtained from patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung 
cancer.
METHODS: In a total of 234 patients with lazertinib pharmacokinetics observed at 
steady state, dose-normalized (DN) area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUCss), maximum concentration (Cmax,ss), and/or trough concentration on day 15 
(CD15) were compared between a group receiving ARA concomitantly for at least 
4 days (ARA group) and another group not receiving ARA (non-ARA group) in a 
dose-proportional range. Additionally, a comparison of pharmacokinetic 
parameters at a therapeutic dose of 240 mg once daily was evaluated.
RESULTS: Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of ARA 
group to non-ARA group for DNAUCss, DNCmax,ss, and DNCD15 at 40 mg to 320 mg 
once daily showing the dose proportionality were 0.8743 (0.7285-1.0493), 0.9035 
(0.7482-1.0910), and 0.9126 (0.7364-1.1311), respectively. GMRs with 90% CIs for 
AUCss, Cmax,ss, and CD15 at 240 mg were 0.9136 (0.6637-1.2576), 0.9012 
(0.6703-1.2116), and 0.8850 (0.6463-1.2118), respectively.
CONCLUSION: All pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different 
between the two groups (p values > 0.05), indicating that co-administered ARAs 
did not significantly affect the steady state pharmacokinetics of lazertinib. 
Therefore, no dose adjustment of lazertinib is required in patients receiving 
concomitant ARAs.
