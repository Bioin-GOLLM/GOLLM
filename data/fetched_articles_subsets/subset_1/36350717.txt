GATA1 mutations that result in loss of the N-terminal 83 amino acids are a 
feature of myeloid leukemia in children with Down syndrome, rare familial cases 
of dyserythropoietic anemia, and a subset of cases of Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 
The Gata1s mouse model, which expresses only the short GATA1 isoform that begins 
at methionine 84, has been shown to have a defect in hematopoiesis, especially 
impaired erythropoiesis with expanded megakaryopoiesis, during gestation. 
However, these mice reportedly did not show any postnatal phenotype. Here, we 
demonstrate that Gata1s mutant mice display macrocytic anemia and features of 
aberrant megakaryopoiesis throughout life, culminating in profound splenomegaly 
and bone marrow fibrosis. These data support the use of this animal model for 
studies of GATA1 deficiencies.
