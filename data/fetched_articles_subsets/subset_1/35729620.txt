BACKGROUND: Airway clearance techniques are supposed to be a necessary adjunct 
for the enhancement of impaired peripheral clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF). 
The objective was to assess the effect of one physiotherapy session (autogenic 
drainage: AD) on mucus clearance (sputum wet weight) and impulse oscillometry 
system (IOS) indices, including those obtained from extended 
Resistance-Inertance-Compliance (eRIC) modelling, considering the degree of 
bronchial congestion.
METHODS: Thirty children with CF (median age: 12.7 years) in a stable condition 
prospectively underwent IOS measurements at baseline and after AD. They were 
divided in two groups: with (visual analog scale of bronchial congestion by the 
physiotherapist ≥ 5/10) and without (scale < 5/10) bronchial congestion. 
Paired-comparison of the effects of AD on airway resistance measurements was 
done with Wilcoxon test.
RESULTS: The congestion scale correlated with the wet weight of sputum 
production during the session (Pearson test: p < 0.0001, R = 0.66). Ten children 
had bronchial congestion and 20 were without congestion. In the whole group, 
R5-20 Hz significantly decreased after AD (P = 0.049), which was related to a 
decrease in the children with congestion (P = 0.025), whereas it was not 
significantly modified in the children without congestion (P = 0.327). The eRIC 
model allowed the calculation of the peripheral resistance of the respiratory 
system, which also decreased in the children with congestion (P = 0.037), 
however, not modified in the children without congestion (P = 0.390).
CONCLUSION: One session of autogenic drainage has the ability to decrease 
peripheral resistance obtained from IOS measurements, more specifically in 
children with CF with moderate to severe bronchial congestion.
