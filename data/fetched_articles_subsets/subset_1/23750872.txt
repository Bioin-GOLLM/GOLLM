BACKGROUND: Though possession of androgenic anabolic steroids (AAS) is illegal, 
non-prescription use of AAS persists.
METHODS: We describe two Caucasian males (aged 25 and 45 years) with cholestatic 
hepatitis following ingestion of the dietary supplement Mass-Drol ('Celtic 
Dragon') containing the AAS 2α-17α-dimethyl-etiocholan-3-one,17β-ol.
RESULTS: Despite substantial hyperbilirubinaemia peak gamma-glutamyl transferase 
(GGT) remained normal. Besides 'bland' intralobular cholestasis, liver biopsy in 
both found deficiency of canalicular expression of ectoenzymes as seen in ATP8B1 
disease. In the older patient, bile salt export pump marking (encoded by ABCB11) 
was focally diminished. We hypothesized that AAS had either induced inhibition 
of normal ATP8B1/ABCB11 expression or triggered initial episodes of benign 
recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) type 1/or 2. On sequencing, ATP8B1 was 
normal in both patients although the younger was heterozygous for the c.2093G>A 
mutation in ABCB11, a polymorphism previously encountered in drug-induced liver 
injury.
CONCLUSION: AAS marketed as dietary supplements continue to cause hepatotoxicity 
in the UK; underlying mechanisms may include unmasking of genetic cholestatic 
syndromes.
