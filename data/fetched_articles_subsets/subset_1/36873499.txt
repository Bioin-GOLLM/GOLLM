Over time, the antigenic evolution of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 has 
demanded the development of potential protective vaccines. Administration of 
additional doses of current vaccines based on the WT spike protein may boost 
immunity, but their effectiveness has dwindled for patients with more recent 
variants. Here, we studied the neutralization activity of post-WT strain-based 
vaccination and a structural simulation in-silico based on the interactions of 
the RBD-hACE2 as the key to initiating infection among the VOCs of SARS-CoV-2. 
Our data display shows that WT sera showed a markedly greater reduction in Delta 
and Omicron, suggesting that the Wuhan-based vaccines may be more susceptible to 
breakthrough and new VOCs. According to the MD simulation, mutations of Omicron 
result in a significant change in the variant charge distribution throughout the 
binding interface that consequently alters the critical interface electrostatic 
potential in comparison to other variants. This observation provides new 
insights into immunization policy and next-generation vaccine development.
