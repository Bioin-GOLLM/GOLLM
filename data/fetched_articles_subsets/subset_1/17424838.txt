OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in MPO, 
NQO1, GSTP1, UGT1A6 and susceptibility to chronic benzene poisoning (BP).
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted. 268 BP patients and 268 workers 
occupationally exposed to benzene without poisoning manifestations were 
investigated. The genotype of MPO (rs7208693), NQO1 (rs1800566), GSTP1 ( 
rs947894 ) and UGT1A6 (rs6759892, rs1105879, rs4124874 ,rs3755319 ,rs887829 and 
rs4148323) were tested by the TaqMan PCR method.
RESULTS: There was a 0.675-fold (95% CI 0.434 - 0.994, P = 0.046) decreased risk 
of BP in the subjects with GSTP1 rs947894 G alleles compared with those carrying 
AA genotype. In the subjects carrying allele of MPO rs7208693 A, the risk of BP 
increased for the individuals carrying allele of UGT1A6 rs6759892 G (OR = 2.702, 
P = 0.024) compared to those with TT genotype or the individusals carrying allel 
of UGT1A6 rs1105879 C (OR = 2.619, P = 0.035) compared to those with TT 
genotype. In drinking population, the individuals carrying the NQO1 rs1800566 TT 
homozygote genotype had a 9.000-fold (5% CI 1.460 - 55.478, P = 0.021) risk of 
BP compared to those with CT + CC genotypes. In smoking population, there was 
7.000-fold (95% CI 1.555 - 31.575, P = 0.012) of risk in BP subjects carrying 
NQO1 rs1800566T/T genotype, compared with those carrying CC + CT genotype. 
Haplotyes analysis of polymorphisms in UGT1A6 showed that compared with those 
carrying TAATGG haplotype, there was a 1.446-fold (OR = 1.446, 95% CI 1.005 - 
2.080, P = 0.046) increased risk of BP for those carrying TACGGG haplotype.
CONCLUSION: The subjects carrying allele of MPO rs7208693 A and UGT1A6 rs6759892 
G or rs1105879 C at the same time could be more susceptible to BP. The subjects 
carrying NQO1 rs1800566 TT genotype and together with the habit of smoking or 
drinking could be more susceptible to BP. Those subjects carrying TAATGG 
haplotype of UGT1A6 could increase the risk of BP. Further studies should be 
needed on the association between the genetic polymorphisms in GSTP1 and the 
risk of BP.
