Presynaptic syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) is essential for 
neurotransmitter release. Heterozygous mutations in this protein cause STXBP1 
encephalopathy (STXBP1-E), which is characterized by intellectual disabilities 
and epilepsies. Since nonhuman primates closely resemble humans, monkey models 
may advance studies on the pathogenesis and therapeutic treatments of STXBP1-E. 
We generated cynomolgus monkeys carrying STXBP1 (R292H) mutation through base 
editing of in vitro fertilized embryos to mimic a clinical condition. The 
newborn STXBP1-edited monkeys exhibited focal epilepsy, and the animal that 
survived beyond the first week postpartum presented typical EEG phenotypes. 
Biochemical analysis of brain biopsy samples showed reduced levels of STXBP1 
(MUNC18-1) and SNARE complex proteins. Single-cell sequencing identified one 
specific cell cluster that may contribute to encephalopathy. Thus, our case 
report shows that base-edited STXBP1 mutant monkeys are a good animal model for 
STXBP1-E, and that a base-editing approach is useful for generating primate 
models of human genetic disorders.
