York Platelet Syndrome (YPS) is a calcium channelopathy caused by gain of 
function in STIM1, a gene which acts as a calcium sensor. It is characterized by 
platelet abnormalities and muscle weakness. Medical literature emphasizes the 
hematologic aspects of the cases with few data of the neuromuscular and 
neuropathologic evaluation. We present a patient with YPS whose myopathy was the 
most prominent aspect. She presented around 2 years of age with proximal 
weakness and easy bruisability. YPS was diagnosed in the infant at 16 months of 
age at the National Institutes of Health. Muscle biopsy demonstrated a severe 
chronic myopathy. Rimmed vacuoles and tubular aggregates were noted. Although 
YPS is rare, the combination of a congenital myopathy with thrombocytopenia may 
facilitate the diagnosis and enable further insights into the disease.
