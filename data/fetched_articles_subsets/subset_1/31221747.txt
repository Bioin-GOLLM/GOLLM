Cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cis-DDP)] is one of the most 
successful anticancer agents effective against a wide range of solid tumors. 
However, its use is restricted by side effects and/or by intrinsic or acquired 
drug resistance. Here, we probed the role of glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1, 
an antiapoptotic protein often overexpressed in drug-resistant tumors, as a 
cis-DDP-binding protein. Our results show that cis-DDP is not a substrate for 
the glutathione (GSH) transferase activity of GST P1-1. Instead, GST P1-1 
sequesters and inactivates cisplatin with the aid of 2 solvent-accessible 
cysteines, resulting in protein subunits cross-linking, while maintaining its 
GSH-conjugation activity. Furthermore, it is well known that GST P1-1 binding to 
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibits JNK phosphorylation, which is 
required for downstream apoptosis signaling. Thus, in turn, GST P1-1 
overexpression and Pt-induced subunit cross-linking could modulate JNK apoptotic 
signaling, further confirming the role of GST P1-1 as an antiapoptotic protein.
