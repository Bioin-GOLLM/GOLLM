Using an integrative genome annotation pipeline (iGAP) for proteome-wide protein 
structure and functional domain assignment, we analyzed all the proteins of 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Three-dimensional structures at the level of the domain 
are assigned by fold recognition and threading based on a novel fold library 
that extends common domain classifications. iGAP is being applied to proteins 
from all available proteomes as part of a comparative proteomics resource. The 
database is accessible from the web.
