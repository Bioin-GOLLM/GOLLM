Rho GTPases including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 act as intracellular molecular 
switches to control cellular responses such as actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, 
gene transcription, cell growth, and possibly transformation. Their roles have 
been increasingly implicated in activation of signaling processes in leukocytes 
including integrin-mediated signal transduction and growth factor-induced cell 
survival and proliferation pathways. In particular, functional disruption of 
Rac2, a hematopoietic-specific Rho GTPase, causes severe myeloid cell 
dysfunction in both mouse and man. Rac2-deficient mice and a human patient with 
a D57N Rac2 mutant share a phenotype of leukocytosis with defective neutrophil 
chemotaxis and superoxide production in response to some, but not all, agonists. 
Our studies also suggested that the phenotypic abnormalities associated with 
D57N may involve not only neutrophil cellular functions, but also abnormal cell 
survival in other hematopoietic cells. Together, these data demonstrate a 
critical and unique role for Rac2 in normal neutrophil function and define a new 
genetic immunodeficiency syndrome in humans.
