Genetic alterations in the cell cycle pathway are common in head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We identified four novel HNSCC susceptibility 
loci (CDKN1C rs452338, CDK4 rs2072052, E2F2 rs3820028 and E2F2 rs2075993) 
through a two-stage matched case-control study. There was a combined effect 
among the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as the number of risk 
genotypes increased, the risk of HNSCC displayed an increasing trend (Ptrend < 
0.001). And there were multiplicative interactions between rs452338 and 
rs2072052, rs2072052 and rs3820028, rs2072052 and rs2075993. Functional 
bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that E2F2 
rs2075993 T>C reduced the stability of E2F2 3'-UTR secondary structure and 
affected the binding of E2F2 to miR-940, which was up-regulated in HNSCC tumor 
tissues (P = 2.9e-8) and was correlated with poor overall survival of HNSCC (HR 
= 1.39, 95% CI = 1.02-1.90). In vitro assays, we discovered that the expression 
of miR-940 was regulated by METTL3, and miR-940 promoted the proliferation, 
migration and invasion, and inhibited the senescence and autophagy of tumor 
cells. In terms of mechanism, compared with rs2075993 allele T, we found that 
the protective variant rs2075993 allele C interfered with the translational 
inhibition of E2F2 by miR-940, resulting in increased expression of E2F2 
protein, which further reduced the proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
increased the senescence of tumor cells.
