BACKGROUND: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytosolic enzyme involved 
in the metabolism of these thiopurine drugs. Methylation of thiopurine drugs by 
TPMT competes with the formation of their active 6-thioguanine nucleotide 
metabolite, thereby potentially modulating the therapeutic and toxic effects of 
these drugs.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the thiopurine S-methyltransferase allelic frequencies in 
Taiwan aborigines and Taiwanese.
METHODS: We used polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism method to determine the allelic frequencies of TPMT variants 
(TPMT*1-TPMT*8) in 409 Taiwan aborigines and 117 Taiwanese.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed that the allelic frequencies of 
TPMT*1 were 99.88% and 98.72% for Taiwan aborigines and Taiwanese respectively. 
The allelic frequencies of TPMT*3C were 0.12% and 1.28% for Taiwan aborigines 
and Taiwanese respectively. No TPMT*2, 3A, 3B, 3D and 4-8 were found in these 
populations.
CONCLUSION: Our results provide useful information for using thiopurine drugs in 
these populations.
