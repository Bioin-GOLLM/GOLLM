BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased 
inflammation and comorbid medical conditions. However, study findings for 
individual inflammatory marker levels have been inconsistent. Some research 
suggests that resilience may play a role in decreased inflammation. A 
polymorphism in the promoter region of the tumor necrosis factor α gene (TNFα), 
TNFA -308 (rs1800629) is associated with psychiatric illness but its role in 
PTSD is yet to be elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates a key inflammatory marker, TNFα, for its role 
in PTSD severity.
METHOD: In a cohort of trauma-exposed Vietnam War veterans (n=299; 159 cases, 
140 controls) TNF α serum levels and TNFα polymorphism rs1800629 were correlated 
with PTSD severity and resilience scores.
RESULTS: The polymorphism was associated with PTSD severity (p=0.045). There 
were significant group differences between cases and controls with regards to 
serum TNFα levels (p=0.036). Significant correlations were found between PTSD 
severity and elevated TNFα levels (r=0.153; p=0.009), and between resilience and 
decreased TNFα levels at a trend level (p=0.08) across the entire cohort. These 
relationships were non-significant after controlling for covariates. In the PTSD 
diagnostic group, a correlation of TNFα and PTSD severity was observed on a 
trend level (p=0.06), the relationship between TNFα and resilience remained 
non-significant.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first time rs1800629 has been 
investigated in PTSD contributing to a growing body of literature that 
identifies the GG as a risk genotype for psychiatric disorders in Caucasian 
cohorts. However, more research is needed to replicate our results in larger, 
equally well-characterized cohorts. The relationship between serum TNFα levels 
and PTSD severity and resilience requires further investigation.
