Immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β cells causes type 1 diabetes 
(T1D). However, how β cells participate in their own destruction during the 
disease process is poorly understood. Here, we report that modulating the 
unfolded protein response (UPR) in β cells of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by 
deleting the UPR sensor IRE1α prior to insulitis induced a transient 
dedifferentiation of β cells, resulting in substantially reduced islet immune 
cell infiltration and β cell apoptosis. Single-cell and whole-islet 
transcriptomics analyses of immature β cells revealed remarkably diminished 
expression of β cell autoantigens and MHC class I components, and upregulation 
of immune inhibitory markers. IRE1α-deficient mice exhibited significantly fewer 
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in their pancreata, and adoptive transfer of their total 
T cells did not induce diabetes in Rag1-/- mice. Our results indicate that 
inducing β cell dedifferentiation, prior to insulitis, allows these cells to 
escape immune-mediated destruction and may be used as a novel preventive 
strategy for T1D in high-risk individuals.
