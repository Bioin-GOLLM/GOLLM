PURPOSE: Pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) tumors have been identified as an entity 
distinct and different from the adult variety of GBM not only with respect to 
pathogenesis, genetics, and molecular alterations but also in clinical outcomes 
and overall survival. This study aims to evaluate the immunohistochemical 
profile of molecular markers in pediatric GBM and correlate them with clinical 
features and prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 29 pGBMs (age range 3 to 
18 years), operated at our institute between 2009 and 2014, and evaluated their 
clinical and histopathological features along with the immunohistochemical 
expression of clinically relevant molecular markers: H3K27M, p53, ATRX, and IDH1 
(R132H), and correlated their expression with clinical features. We further 
assessed the prognostic value of these markers in our cohort of patients.
RESULTS: The median overall survival (OS) of the cohort was 6.00 ± 0.882 months. 
The mean overall survival was 7.571 ± 1.118 months which was lower than in most 
studies. Preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), extent of surgical 
resection, and adjuvant radiotherapy were found to be the clinical factors 
strongly influencing median survival (p < 0.05). Loss of ATRX expression was 
predominantly noted in hemispheric tumors (84%), while p53 staining was maximum 
in thalamic tumors (8 out of 9 cases). H3K27M mutant protein expression was 
noted in 8/9 thalamic tumors and 5/7 tumors in the brain 
stem-cerebellar-peduncular region. Patients with tumors showing H3K27M 
immunopositivity had the worst prognosis with a mean OS of 
5 months ± 0.832 months, as against patients with H3K27M-immunonegative tumors, 
which was 10.143 ± 1.866 months(p = 0.006). Other markers like p53, ATRX, and 
IDH1 did not influence the prognosis in this patient cohort. ATRX loss of 
expression was associated with a better OS, with a trend to significance, and 
such an association has not been reported earlier.
CONCLUSIONS: Ours is one among the few studies from India describing the 
clinical parameters and evaluating the key immunohistochemical markers in pGBM 
and deriving their prognostic significance. The study reiterates the poor 
prognostic significance of H3K27M immunopositivity.
