BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) have been shown to play a role in 
colorectal cancer (CRC). More recently, MMP1, MMP3 and MMP7 functional gene 
promoter polymorphisms have been found to be associated with CRC occurrence and 
prognosis. To document the role of MMP polymorphisms in the early step of 
colorectal carcinogenesis, we investigated their association with colorectal 
adenoma risk in a case-control study comprising 295 patients with large adenomas 
(LA), 302 patients with small adenomas (SA) and 568 polyp-free (PF) controls.
METHODS: Patients were genotyped using automated fragment analysis for MMP1 
-1607 ins/del G and MMP3 -1612 ins/delA (MMP3.1) polymorphisms and allelic 
discrimination assay for MMP3 -709 A/G (MMP3.2) and MMP7 -181 A/G polymorphisms. 
Association between MMP genotypes and colorectal adenomas was first tested for 
each polymorphism separately and then for combined genotypes using the 
combination test. Adjustment on relevant variables and estimation of odds ratios 
were performed using unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: No association was observed between the polymorphisms and LA when 
compared to PF or SA. When comparing SA to PF controls, analysis revealed a 
significant association between MMP3 -1612 ins/delA polymorphism and SA with an 
increased risk associated with the 6A/6A genotype (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 
1.20-2.34). Using the combination test, the best association was found for 
MMP3.1-MMP1 (p = 0.001) with an OR of 1.88 (95% CI: 1.08-3.28) for the combined 
genotype 2G/2G-6A/6A estimated by logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: These data show a relation between MMP1 -1607 ins/del G and MMP3 
-1612 ins/delA combined polymorphisms and risk of SA, suggesting their potential 
role in the early steps of colorectal carcinogenesis.
