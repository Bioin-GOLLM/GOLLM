The existence and properties of intracellular waves of increased free 
cytoplasmic calcium concentration (calcium waves) are strongly affected by the 
binding and unbinding of calcium ions to a multitude of different buffers in the 
cell. These buffers can be mobile or immobile and, in general, have multiple 
binding sites that are not independent. Previous theoretical studies have 
focused on the case when each buffer molecule binds a single calcium ion. In 
this study, we analyze how calcium waves are affected by calcium buffers with 
two non-independent binding sites, and show that the interactions between the 
calcium binding sites can result in the emergence of new behaviors. In 
particular, for certain combinations of kinetic parameters, the profiles of 
buffer molecules with one calcium ion bound can be non-monotone.
