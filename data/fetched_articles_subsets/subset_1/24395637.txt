The precise regulation of synapse maintenance is critical to the development and 
function of neuronal circuits. Using an in vivo RNAi screen targeting the 
Drosophila kinome and phosphatome, we identify 11 kinases and phosphatases 
controlling synapse stability by regulating cytoskeletal, phospholipid, or 
metabolic signaling. We focus on casein kinase 2 (CK2) and demonstrate that the 
regulatory (β) and catalytic (α) subunits of CK2 are essential for synapse 
maintenance. CK2α kinase activity is required in the presynaptic motoneuron, and 
its interaction with CK2β, mediated cooperatively by two N-terminal residues of 
CK2α, is essential for CK2 holoenzyme complex stability and function in vivo. 
Using genetic and biochemical approaches we identify Ankyrin2 as a key 
presynaptic target of CK2 to maintain synapse stability. In addition, CK2 
activity controls the subcellular organization of individual synaptic release 
sites within the presynaptic nerve terminal. Our study identifies 
phosphorylation of structural synaptic components as a compelling mechanism to 
actively control the development and longevity of synaptic connections.
