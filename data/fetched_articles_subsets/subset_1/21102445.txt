The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination is 
essential for genomic stability. The first step in this process is resection of 
5' strands to generate 3' single-stranded DNA intermediates. Efficient resection 
in budding yeast requires the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex and the Sae2 
protein, although the role of MRX has been unclear because Mre11 paradoxically 
has 3'â†’5' exonuclease activity in vitro. Here we reconstitute resection with 
purified MRX, Sae2 and Exo1 proteins and show that degradation of the 5' strand 
is catalyzed by Exo1 yet completely dependent on MRX and Sae2 when Exo1 levels 
are limiting. This stimulation is mainly caused by cooperative binding of DNA 
substrates by Exo1, MRX and Sae2. This work establishes the direct role of MRX 
and Sae2 in promoting the resection of 5' strands in DNA DSB repair.
