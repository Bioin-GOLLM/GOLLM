Diverting aminoacyl-transfer RNAs (tRNAs) from protein synthesis is a well-known 
process used by a wide range of bacteria to aminoacylate membrane constituents. 
By tRNA-dependently adding amino acids to glycerolipids, bacteria change their 
cell surface properties, which intensifies antimicrobial drug resistance, 
pathogenicity, and virulence. No equivalent aminoacylated lipids have been 
uncovered in any eukaryotic species thus far, suggesting that tRNA-dependent 
lipid remodeling is a process restricted to prokaryotes. We report here the 
discovery of ergosteryl-3β-O-l-aspartate (Erg-Asp), a conjugated sterol that is 
produced by the tRNA-dependent addition of aspartate to the 3β-OH group of 
ergosterol, the major sterol found in fungal membranes. In fact, Erg-Asp exists 
in the majority of "higher" fungi, including species of biotechnological 
interest, and, more importantly, in human pathogens like Aspergillus fumigatus 
We show that a bifunctional enzyme, ergosteryl-3β-O-l-aspartate synthase (ErdS), 
is responsible for Erg-Asp synthesis. ErdS corresponds to a unique fusion of an 
aspartyl-tRNA synthetase-that produces aspartyl-tRNAAsp (Asp-tRNAAsp)-and of a 
Domain of Unknown Function 2156, which actually transfers aspartate from 
Asp-tRNAAsp onto ergosterol. We also uncovered that removal of the Asp modifier 
from Erg-Asp is catalyzed by a second enzyme, ErdH, that is a genuine Erg-Asp 
hydrolase participating in the turnover of the conjugated sterol in vivo. 
Phylogenomics highlights that the entire Erg-Asp synthesis/degradation pathway 
is conserved across "higher" fungi. Given the central roles of sterols and 
conjugated sterols in fungi, we propose that this tRNA-dependent ergosterol 
modification and homeostasis system might have broader implications in membrane 
remodeling, trafficking, antimicrobial resistance, or pathogenicity.
