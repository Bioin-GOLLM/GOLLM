Rice bran is a rich source of health-promoting nutrition and bioactive 
compounds; nevertheless, the properties of rice brans depend on cultivars, ages, 
and preparation methods, drawing the potential of raw materials for health 
benefits. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the health-promoting 
properties of fermented rice bran extracts from cultivar black rice (H7F) and 
germinated brown rice (G13F), focusing on their prebiotic, antipathogenic 
bacteria activity and safety demonstrated in vitro and in vivo study models, 
respectively. Here, the screening of metabolites' change after rice bran 
fermentation by ATR-FTIR spectra revealed specific peaks corresponding to the 
composited components of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid. Then, in the in vitro 
study, the prebiotic capability of H7F and G13F extracts was demonstrated by a 
growth-promoting effect on Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis under 
specific acidic conditions. Furthermore, antipathogenic bacterial activity 
against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was presented at 25 mg/mL of 
MIC values and 50 mg/mL of MBC of both fermented rice bran extracts, eliminating 
the bacteria by interfering with the biofilm formation. For safety, an acute and 
chronic toxicity study using Wistar rats was conducted, in which changes in the 
body and organ weights, histopathology of organs, blood chemistry, and 
hematological parameters were observed after H7F and G13F treatment. Desirably, 
they showed no toxicity, with a significant reduction in blood cholesterol 
levels in the chronic treatment of H7F and G13F. Conclusively, the overall 
results evidenced the health benefits of H7F and G13F related to their prebiotic 
and antipathogenic bacteria properties and hypocholesterolemia potential with a 
high level of safety. Therefore, the fermented rice bran extracts were 
demonstrated as potential materials for the further development of functional 
ingredients and health products.
