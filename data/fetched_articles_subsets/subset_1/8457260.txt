Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) is a dominantly inherited disorder 
associated with hypercholesterolemia, in which substitution of the amino acid 
glutamine for arginine at position 3500 in the apoprotein B molecule results in 
LDL particles which bind poorly to the LDL receptor. To date, patients with FDB 
have been heterozygous for this disorder and their plasma contains both normal 
and defective-binding LDL particles, with a predominance of the latter. In the 
present report, we have compared the hypocholesterolemic effects of bile acid 
sequestrant therapy (cholestyramine or colestipol) in eight patients with FDB, 
to the response seen in sixteen patients with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (FH), treated with the same drugs. Concentrations of LDL 
cholesterol fell by 32.0% in the patients with FDB and by 21.6% in the patients 
with FH. The results indicate that the hypercholesterolemia of both FDB and FH 
responds to treatment with bile acid sequestrants.
