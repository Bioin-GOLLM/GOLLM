Thin corpus callosum has been recently observed in two patients with an 
autosomal dominant trait of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) linked to a 
novel mutation in the spastin gene (SPG4). In the same two patients cerebellar 
atrophy has been found. Reportedly, in other members of the same family, there 
has been a variable presence of mental retardation. We report on the clinical 
and genetic investigation of an Austrian family with a novel mutation in the 
spastin gene. Genetic analysis of the SPG4 locus revealed a mutation (C1120A) 
and a known intronic polymorphism (996-47G>A) of the spastin gene. In one 
affected family member, previously undescribed dysplasia of the corpus callosum 
(CC) was found in conjunction with otherwise uncomplicated HSP. Dysplastic CC 
was not paralleled with cortical atrophy, cognitive impairment or other 
phenotypic variations. Two further affected family members showed the same 
mutation and polymorphism, but no evidence of CC abnormalities. We conclude that 
apparently pure HSP may present with MRI features of dysplastic CC. This finding 
extended the spastin-related phenotype which is distinct from previous reports 
of thin CC in HSP.
