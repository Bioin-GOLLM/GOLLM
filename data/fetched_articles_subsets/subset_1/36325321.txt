Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a heterogeneous systemic disease. The abnormal 
responses to La/SSB and Ro/SSA of both B-cells and T-cells are implicated as 
well as others, in the destruction of the epithelium of the exocrine glands, 
whose tissue characteristically shows a peri-epithelial lymphocytic infiltration 
that can vary from sicca syndrome to systemic disease and lymphoma. Despite the 
appearance of new autoantibodies, anti-Ro/SSA is still the only autoantibody 
included in the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against 
Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria and is used extensively as a 
traditional biomarker in clinical practice. The study and findings of new 
autoantibodies in SjS has risen in the previous decade, with a central role 
given to diagnosis and elucidating new aspects of SjS physiopathology, while 
raising the opportunity to establish clinical phenotypes with the goal of 
predicting long-term complications. In this paper, we critically review the 
classic and the novel autoantibodies in SjS, analyzing the methods employed for 
detection, the pathogenic role and the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes.
