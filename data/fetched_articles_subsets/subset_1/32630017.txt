Immunotoxins are a class of targeted cancer therapeutics in which a toxin such 
as Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) is linked to an antibody or cytokine to direct 
the toxin to a target on cancer cells. While a variety of PE-based immunotoxins 
have been developed and a few have demonstrated promising clinical and 
preclinical results, cancer cells frequently have or develop resistance to these 
immunotoxins. This review presents our current understanding of the mechanism of 
action of PE-based immunotoxins and discusses cellular mechanisms of resistance 
that interfere with various steps of the pathway. These steps include binding of 
the immunotoxin to the target antigen, internalization, intracellular processing 
and trafficking to reach the cytosol, inhibition of protein synthesis through 
ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF2), and induction of apoptosis. 
Combination therapies that increase immunotoxin action and overcome specific 
mechanisms of resistance are also reviewed.
