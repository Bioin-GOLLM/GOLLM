Background: The aim of this study was to determine the performance of the Dexcom 
G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system across three sensor wear sites in 
pregnant women with diabetes in the second or third trimesters. Methods: 
Participants with type 1 (T1D), type 2 (T2D), or gestational (GDM) diabetes 
mellitus were enrolled at three sites. Each wore two G6 sensors on the abdomen, 
upper buttock, and/or posterior upper arm for 10 days and underwent a 6-h clinic 
session between days 3 and 7 of sensor wear, during which YSI reference blood 
glucose values were obtained every 30 min. No intentional glucose manipulations 
were performed. Accuracy metrics included the proportion of CGM values that were 
within ±20% of paired reference values >100 mg/dL or ±20 mg/dL of YSI values 
≤100 mg/dL (hereafter referred to as %20/20), as well as the analogous %15/15, 
%30/30, and %40/40. The mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between CGM-YSI 
pairs was also calculated. Results: Thirty-two participants with T1D (n = 20), 
T2D (n = 3), or GDM (n = 9) were enrolled: 19 were in the second trimester and 
13 were in the third trimester of pregnancy. Compared with the reference, 92.5% 
of CGM values were within ±20%/20 mg/dL. The overall MARD and that of sensors 
worn on the abdomen, upper buttock, and posterior upper arm was 10.3%, 11.5%, 
11.2%, and 8.7%, respectively. There were no device-related adverse events. Skin 
reactions at the insertion sites were absent or minor. Conclusions: The Dexcom 
G6 CGM system is accurate and safe in pregnant women with diabetes.
