PURPOSE: Routine brain MRI surveillance frequently diagnoses small, asymptomatic 
brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that are effectively 
treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A subset of patients, however, may 
die prior to the onset of symptoms. This study identifies clinical features that 
distinguish neurologically-asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases patients that die 
prior to routine 3 month follow-up after SRS.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2017 identified 18 patients 
with neurologically-asymptomatic NSCLC brain metastases who died < 3 months 
after SRS. Twenty-eight additional patients meeting criteria and surviving > 6 
months after SRS were identified. Clinical factors were examined to determine 
characteristics correlated with survival using cox proportional hazards and 
nominal logistic regression models. Logistic regression models using salient 
factors were trained with 10-fold cross-validation and compared to the graded 
prognostic assessment (GPA) and score index of radiosurgery (SIR) using the AUC 
from receiver operant characteristic curves.
RESULTS: The median survival following SRS was 1.4 and 9.2 months for the < 3 
months and > 6 months groups, respectively. Age, number of brain metastases, and 
Karnofsky performance status were associated with overall survival while gender 
and interval between primary cancer and first brain metastasis diagnoses were 
associated with < 3 months and > 6 months survival, respectively. Models using 
GPA and SIR performed poorly compared to preliminary metrics generated in this 
study for prognosis of both < 3 months and > 6 months survival.
CONCLUSION: Physicians require data to provide high-value, cost-conscious health 
care. Clinical metrics can screen patients with asymptomatic NSCLC brain 
metastases likely to die prior to the standard screening interval and 
observation could be considered.
