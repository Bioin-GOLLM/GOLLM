Specific residues of influenza A virus (IAV) PB1-F2 proteins may enhance 
inflammation or cytotoxicity. In a series of studies, we evaluated the function 
of these virulence-associated residues in the context of different IAV subtypes 
in mice. Here, we demonstrate that, as with the previously assessed pandemic 
1968 (H3N2) IAV, PB1-F2 inflammatory residues increase the virulence of H1N1 
IAV, suggesting that this effect might be a universal feature. Combining both 
inflammatory and cytotoxic residues in PB1-F2 enhanced virulence further, 
compared to either motif alone. Residues from these virulent motifs have been 
present in natural isolates from human seasonal IAV of all subtypes, but there 
has been a trend toward a gradual reduction in the number of virulent residues 
over time. However, human IAV of swine and avian origin tend to have more 
virulent residues than do the human-adapted seasonal strains, raising the 
possibility that donation of PB1 segments from these zoonotic viruses may 
increase the severity of some seasonal human strains. Our data suggest the value 
of surveillance of virulent residues in both human and animal IAV to predict the 
severity of influenza season.
