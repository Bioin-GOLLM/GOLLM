Replication checkpoint is essential for maintaining genome integrity in response 
to various replication stresses as well as during the normal growth. The 
evolutionally conserved ATR-Claspin-Chk1 pathway is induced during replication 
checkpoint activation. Cdc7 kinase, required for initiation of DNA replication 
at replication origins, has been implicated in checkpoint activation but how it 
is involved in this pathway has not been known. Here, we show that Cdc7 is 
required for Claspin-Chk1 interaction in human cancer cells by phosphorylating 
CKBD (Chk1-binding-domain) of Claspin. The residual Chk1 activation in 
Cdc7-depleted cells is lost upon further depletion of casein kinase1 (CK1γ1), 
previously reported to phosphorylate CKBD. Thus, Cdc7, in conjunction with 
CK1γ1, facilitates the interaction between Claspin and Chk1 through 
phosphorylating CKBD. We also show that, whereas Cdc7 is predominantly 
responsible for CKBD phosphorylation in cancer cells, CK1γ1 plays a major role 
in non-cancer cells, providing rationale for targeting Cdc7 for cancer 
cell-specific cell killing.
