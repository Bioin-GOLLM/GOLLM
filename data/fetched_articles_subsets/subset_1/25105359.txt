The repurposed CRISPR-Cas9 system has recently emerged as a revolutionary 
genome-editing tool. Here we report a modification in the expression of the 
guide RNA (gRNA) required for targeting that greatly expands the targetable 
genome. gRNA expression through the commonly used U6 promoter requires a 
guanosine nucleotide to initiate transcription, thus constraining 
genomic-targeting sites to GN19NGG. We demonstrate the ability to modify 
endogenous genes using H1 promoter-expressed gRNAs, which can be used to target 
both AN19NGG and GN19NGG genomic sites. AN19NGG sites occur ~15% more frequently 
than GN19NGG sites in the human genome and the increase in targeting space is 
also enriched at human genes and disease loci. Together, our results enhance the 
versatility of the CRISPR technology by more than doubling the number of 
targetable sites within the human genome and other eukaryotic species.
