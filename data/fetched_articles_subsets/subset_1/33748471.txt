Many patients fail to respond to EGFR-targeted therapeutics, and personalized 
diagnostics is needed to identify putative responders. We investigated 1630 
colorectal and lung squamous carcinomas and 1357 normal lung and colon samples 
and observed huge variation in EGFR pathway activation in both cancerous and 
healthy tissues, irrespectively on EGFR gene mutation status. We investigated 
whether human blood serum can affect squamous carcinoma cell growth and EGFR 
drug response. We demonstrate that human serum antagonizes the effects of 
EGFR-targeted drugs erlotinib and cetuximab on A431 squamous carcinoma cells by 
increasing IC50 by about 2- and 20-fold, respectively. The effects on 
clonogenicity varied significantly across the individual serum samples in every 
experiment, with up to 100% differences. EGF concentration could explain many 
effects of blood serum samples, and EGFR ligands-depleted serum showed lesser 
effect on drug sensitivity.
