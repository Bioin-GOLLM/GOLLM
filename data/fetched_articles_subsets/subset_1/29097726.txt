Long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) exert pro-inflammatory effects in vivo. However, 
little is known regarding the effect of LCFAs on invariant (i) NKT cell 
functions. Here, we report an inhibitory effect of saturated LCFAs on 
transcription factors in iNKT cells. Among the saturated LCFAs, palmitic acid 
(PA) specifically inhibited IL-4 and IFN-γ production and reduced gata-3 and 
t-bet transcript levels in iNKT cells during TCR-mediated activation. In iNKT 
cells, PA was localized and induced dilation in the endoplasmic reticulum and 
increased the mRNA levels of downstream molecules of IRE1α RNase. Moreover, PA 
increased the degradation rates of gata-3 and t-bet mRNA, which was restored by 
IRE1α inhibition or transfection with mutant gata-3 or t-bet, indicating that 
gata-3 and t-bet are cleaved via regulated IRE1α-dependent decay (RIDD). A 
PA-rich diet and PA injection suppressed IL-4 and IFN-γ production by iNKT cells 
in C57BL/6, but not Jα18 knockout mice, which was restored by injection of 
STF083010, an IRE1α-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, a PA-rich diet and PA 
injection attenuated arthritis in an iNKT cell-dependent manner. Taken together, 
our experiments demonstrate that a saturated LCFA induced RIDD-mediated t-bet 
and gata-3 mRNA degradation in iNKT cells, thereby suppressing arthritis.
