Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is facing a growing co-epidemic of chronic HIV 
infection and diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) may underestimate glycemia among 
people living with HIV (PLWH). We estimated the validity of A1c to diagnose 
diabetes among PLWH and HIV-uninfected persons in rural Uganda. Data were 
derived from a cohort of PLWH and age- and gender-matched HIV-uninfected 
comparators. We compared A1c to fasting blood glucose (FBG) using Pearson 
correlations, regression models, and estimated the sensitivity and specificity 
of A1c for detecting diabetes with FBG ≥126 mg/dL as reference standard. 
Approximately half (48%) of the 212 participants were female, mean age of 51.7 
years (SD = 7.0) at enrollment. All PLWH (n = 118) were on antiretroviral 
therapy for a median of 7.5 years with mean CD4 cell count of 442 cells/µL. Mean 
FBG (89.7 mg/dL) and A1c (5.6%) were not different between PLWH and 
HIV-uninfected ( P > 0.50) groups, but the HIV-uninfected group had a higher 
prevalence of A1c >5.7% (33% vs. 20%, P = 0.024). We found a relatively strong 
correlation between A1c and FBG (r = 0.67). An A1c ≥6.5% had a poor sensitivity 
(46%, 95% CI 26-67%) but high specificity (98%, 95% CI 96-99%) for detecting 
diabetes. More work is needed to define an optimal A1c for screening diabetes in 
SSA.
