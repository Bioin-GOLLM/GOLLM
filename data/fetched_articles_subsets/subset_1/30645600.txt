BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acute hepatitis C (AHC) is not frequently identified because 
patients are usually asymptomatic, although may be recognized after iatrogenic 
exposures such as needle stick injuries, medical injection, and acupuncture. We 
describe an outbreak of AHC among 12 patients who received IV saline flush from 
a single multi-dose vial after intravenous contrast administration for a 
computerized tomography (CT) scan. The last patient to receive IV contrast with 
saline flush from a multi-dose vial at the clinic on the previous day was known 
to have chronic HCV genotype 1b (termed potential source, PS). Here we sought to 
confirm (via genetic analysis) the source of infection and to predict the 
minimal contaminating level of IV saline flush needed to transmit infectious 
virus to all patients.
METHODS: In order to confirm the source of infection, we sequenced the HCV E1E2 
region in 7 CT patients, in PS, and in 2 control samples from unrelated patients 
also infected with HCV genotype 1b. A transmission probabilistic model was 
developed to predict the contamination volume of blood that would have been 
sufficient to transmit infectious virus to all patients.
RESULTS: Viral sequencing showed close clustering of the cases with the PS. The 
transmission probabilistic model predicted that contamination of the multi-dose 
saline vial with 0.6-8.7 microliters of blood would have been sufficient to 
transmit infectious virus to all patients.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of this unique cohort provides a new understanding of HCV 
transmission with respect to contaminating volumes and viral titers.
