Cells demonstrate plasticity following injury, but the extent of this phenomenon 
and the cellular mechanisms involved remain underexplored. Using single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) and lineage tracing, we uncover that myoepithelial cells 
(MECs) of the submucosal glands (SMGs) proliferate and migrate to repopulate the 
airway surface epithelium (SE) in multiple injury models. Specifically, 
SMG-derived cells display multipotency and contribute to basal and luminal cell 
types of the SMGs and SE. Ex vivo expanded MECs have the potential to repopulate 
and differentiate into SE cells when grafted onto denuded airway scaffolds. 
Significantly, we find that SMG-like cells appear on the SE of both extra- and 
intra-lobular airways of large animal lungs following severe injury. We find 
that the transcription factor SOX9 is necessary for MEC plasticity in airway 
regeneration. Because SMGs are abundant and present deep within airways, they 
may serve as a reserve cell source for enhancing human airway regeneration.
