Collective cell migration (CCM) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are 
common to cancer and morphogenesis, and are often considered to be mutually 
exclusive in spite of the fact that many cancer and embryonic cells that have 
gone through EMT still cooperate to migrate collectively. Here we use neural 
crest (NC) cells to address the question of how cells that have down-regulated 
cell-cell adhesions can migrate collectively. NC cell dissociation relies on a 
qualitative and quantitative change of the cadherin repertoire. We found that 
the level of cell-cell adhesion is precisely regulated by internalization of 
N-cadherin downstream of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor 2. Rather than 
promoting the generation of single, fully mesenchymal cells, this reduction of 
membrane N-cadherin only triggers a partial mesenchymal phenotype. This 
intermediate phenotype is characterized by an increase in tissue fluidity akin 
to a solid-like-to-fluid-like transition. This change of plasticity allows cells 
to migrate under physical constraints without abolishing cell cooperation 
required for collectiveness.
