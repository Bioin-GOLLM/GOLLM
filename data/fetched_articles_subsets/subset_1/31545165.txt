Enhancers are the primary DNA regulatory elements that confer cell type 
specificity of gene expression. Recent studies characterizing individual 
enhancers have revealed their potential to direct heterologous gene expression 
in a highly cell-type-specific manner. However, it has not yet been possible to 
systematically identify and test the function of enhancers for each of the many 
cell types in an organism. We have developed PESCA, a scalable and generalizable 
method that leverages ATAC- and single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, to 
characterize cell-type-specific enhancers that should enable genetic access and 
perturbation of gene function across mammalian cell types. Focusing on the 
highly heterogeneous mammalian cerebral cortex, we apply PESCA to find enhancers 
and generate viral reagents capable of accessing and manipulating a subset of 
somatostatin-expressing cortical interneurons with high specificity. This study 
demonstrates the utility of this platform for developing new cell-type-specific 
viral reagents, with significant implications for both basic and translational 
research.
