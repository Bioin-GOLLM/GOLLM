A 5417-base pair (bp) region of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO chromosomal DNA 
containing the mmsAB operon and an upstream regulatory gene (mmsR) has been 
cloned and characterized. The operon contains two structural genes involved in 
valine metabolism: mmsA, which encodes methylmalonate-semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase; and mmsB, which encodes 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase. mmsA 
and mmsB share the same orientation and are separated by a 16-bp noncoding 
region. The transcriptional start site for the operon has been pinpointed to a 
cytidine residue located 77 bp from the translational start site of the operon. 
mmsR is located on the opposite strand and begins 134 bp from the translational 
start site of mmsA. MmsR has been identified as a member of the XylS/AraC family 
of transcriptional regulators and appears to act as a positive regulator of the 
mmsAB operon. Sequence comparison of MmsA to other proteins in the data bases 
revealed that MmsA belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD+) superfamily. 
MmsB shares a 44% amino acid identity with 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase 
from rat liver. Mutants with insertionally inactivated mmsR, mmsA, and mmsB grow 
slowly on valine/isoleucine medium and exhibit reduced enzyme activity in 
cell-free extracts compared to P. aeruginosa PAO.
