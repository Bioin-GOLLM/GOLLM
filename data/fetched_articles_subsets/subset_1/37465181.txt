BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important infectious pathogen of lower 
respiratory tract infection in children and adolescents. Macrolide resistant M. 
pneumoniae (MRMP) has become increasingly prevalent, and identifying pathogen 
resistance genes is crucial for treatment.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient with severe refractory M. pneumoniae 
pneumonia (MPP). The failure of initial clinical treatment prompted the 
re-analysis of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) data for 
macrolide-resistant gene. Macrolide-resistance 23S ribosomal RNA gene was 
confirmed with read depth of 64 X for the A2063G mutation, which can decrease 
the affinity of macrolide with M. pneumoniae ribosome resulting in macrolide 
resistance. Furthermore, antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that 
M. pneumoniae was resistant to macrolide. PCR confirmatory test about M. 
pneumoniae resistance A2063G mutation, clinical treatment course and prognosis 
with altered treatment strategy, and M. pneumoniae antimicrobial susceptibility 
confirmed that the severe refractory MPP was due to macrolide resistant M. 
pneumoniae.
CONCLUSION: As a new molecular level detection, mNGS is an effective method for 
detecting M. pneumoniae resistance genes. Early recognition of macrolide 
resistance and suitable antibiotics strategy is of vital importance for the 
prognosis of severe refractory MPP.
