Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an inherited disease of heart muscle that 
can be caused by mutations in sarcomere proteins. Clinical diagnosis depends on 
an abnormal thickening of the heart, but the earliest signs of disease are 
hyperdynamic contraction and impaired relaxation. Whereas some in vitro studies 
of power generation by mutant and wild-type sarcomere proteins are consistent 
with mutant sarcomeres exhibiting enhanced contractile power, others are not. We 
identified a small molecule, MYK-461, that reduces contractility by decreasing 
the adenosine triphosphatase activity of the cardiac myosin heavy chain. Here we 
demonstrate that early, chronic administration of MYK-461 suppresses the 
development of ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte disarray, and myocardial 
fibrosis and attenuates hypertrophic and profibrotic gene expression in mice 
harboring heterozygous human mutations in the myosin heavy chain. These data 
indicate that hyperdynamic contraction is essential for HCM pathobiology and 
that inhibitors of sarcomere contraction may be a valuable therapeutic approach 
for HCM.
