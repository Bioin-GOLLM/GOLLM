High-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) provides important 
advantages in studies of metabolism because more than half of common 
intermediary metabolites can be measured in 10 min with minimal pre-detector 
separation and without ion dissociation. This capability allows unprecedented 
opportunity to study complex metabolic systems, such as mitochondria. Analysis 
of mouse liver mitochondria using FTMS with liquid chromatography shows that sex 
and genotypic differences in mitochondrial metabolism can be readily 
distinguished. Additionally, differences in mitochondrial function are readily 
measured, and many of the mitochondria-related metabolites are also measurable 
in plasma. Thus, application of high-resolution mass spectrometry provides an 
approach for integrated studies of complex metabolic processes of mitochondrial 
function and dysfunction in disease.
