Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the main cause of mortality in axial 
spondyloarthritis (axSpA). CV risk is enhanced by dysregulation of adipokines. 
Low omentin levels were associated with metabolic dysfunction and CV disease in 
conditions different from axSpA. Accordingly, we evaluated the genetic and 
functional implication of omentin in CV risk and subclinical atherosclerosis in 
a cohort of 385 axSpA patients. Subclinical atherosclerosis was evaluated by 
carotid ultrasound. Omentin rs12409609, in linkage disequilibrium with a 
polymorphism associated with CV risk, was genotyped in 385 patients and 84 
controls. Serum omentin levels were also determined. omentin mRNA expression was 
assessed in a subgroup of individuals. Serum and mRNA omentin levels were lower 
in axSpA compared to controls. Low serum omentin levels were related to male 
sex, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and high atherogenic index. 
rs12409609 minor allele was associated with low omentin mRNA expression in 
axSpA. No association was observed with subclinical atherosclerosis at the 
genetic or functional level. In conclusion, in our study low omentin serum 
levels were associated with CV risk factors in axSpA. Furthermore, rs12409609 
minor allele may be downregulating the expression of omentin. These data support 
a role of omentin as a CV risk biomarker in axSpA.
