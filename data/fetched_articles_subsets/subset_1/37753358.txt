AIM: The increasing burden of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) is 
becoming a major issue for hospital-acquired infections. Therefore, 
understanding the molecular mechanisms is important.
METHODOLOGY: Resistance genes of phenotypically colistin-resistant GNB (n = 60) 
were determined using whole genome sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility 
patterns were detected by Vitek®2 & broth microdilution.
RESULTS: Of these phenotypically colistin-resistant isolates, 78% were also 
genetically resistant to colistin. Activation of efflux pumps, and 
point-mutations in pmrB, and MgrB genes conferred colistin resistance among GNB. 
Eight different strains of K. pneumoniae were identified and ST43 was the most 
prominent strain with capsular type-specific (cps) gene KL30.
DISCUSSION: These results, in combination with rapid diagnostic methods, will 
help us better advice appropriate antimicrobial regimens.
