In the title compound, C(22)H(15)BrClN(3)O(3), the benzotriazole ring system 
makes dihedral angles of 2.43 (1) and 71.51 (1)° with the bromo-phenyl and 
chloro-phenyl rings, respectively; the angle between the latter two rings is 
69.26 (1)°. In the crystal structure, mol-ecules are linked into chains by 
inter-molecular C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The crystal packing is further stabilized 
by π-π (with a centroid-centroid distance of 3.764 Å) and C-H⋯π inter-actions.
