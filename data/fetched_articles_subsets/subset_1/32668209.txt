During embryonic development and cancer metastasis, migratory cells must 
establish stable connections with new partners at their destinations. Here, we 
establish the Drosophila border cells as a model for this multistep process. 
During oogenesis, border cells delaminate from the follicular epithelium and 
migrate. When they reach their target, the oocyte, they undergo a stereotypical 
series of steps to adhere to it, then connect with another migrating epithelium. 
We identify gap-junction-forming innexin proteins as critical. Surprisingly, the 
channel function is dispensable. Instead, Innexins 2 and 3 function within the 
border cells, and Innexin 4 functions within the germline, to regulate 
microtubules. The microtubule-dependent border cell-oocyte interaction is 
essential to brace the cells against external morphogenetic forces. Thus, we 
establish an experimental model and use genetic, thermogenetic, and live-imaging 
approaches to uncover the contributions of Innexins and microtubules to a 
cell-biological process important in development and cancer.
