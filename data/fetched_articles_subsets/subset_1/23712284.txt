Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is often 
associated with the development of food allergy and asthma. New insights into AD 
reveals an important role for structural abnormalities in the epidermis 
resulting in a leaky epithelial barrier as well as chronic immune activation 
that contribute to the pathophysiology of this common skin disease. Patients 
with AD have a predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial 
organisms, most notably Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). 
Measures directed at healing and protecting the skin barrier and controlling the 
immune activation are needed for effective management of AD. Early intervention 
may improve outcomes for AD as well as reduce the systemic allergen 
sensitization that may lead to associated allergic diseases in other organs.
