Endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in many human angiogenesis-related 
diseases, including cancer and retinopathies. Small non-coding microRNAs 
(miRNAs) repress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are 
critical for endothelial cell gene expression and function and are involved in 
many pathophysiological processes. The miR-181 family is one of the essential 
angiogenic regulators. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of 
the role of miR-181 family members in endothelial cell dysfunction, with 
emphasis on their pathophysiological roles in aberrant angiogenesis. The actions 
of miR-181 members are summarized concerning their targets and associated major 
angiogenic signaling pathways in a cancer-specific context. Elucidating the 
underlying functional mechanisms of miR-181 family members that are dysregulated 
in endothelial cells or cancer cells is invaluable for developing miRNA-based 
therapeutics for angiogenesis-related diseases such as retinopathies, angiogenic 
tumors, and cancer. Finally, potential clinical applications of miR-181 family 
members in anti-angiogenic tumor therapy are discussed.
