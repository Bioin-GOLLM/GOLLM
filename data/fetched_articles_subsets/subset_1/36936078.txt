We describe an innovative system that exports diverse recombinant proteins in 
membrane-bound vesicles from E. coli. These recombinant vesicles 
compartmentalize proteins within a micro-environment that enables production of 
otherwise challenging insoluble, toxic, or disulfide-bond containing proteins 
from bacteria. The release of vesicle-packaged proteins supports isolation from 
the culture and allows long-term storage of active protein. This technology 
results in high yields of vesicle-packaged, functional proteins for efficient 
downstream processing for a wide range of applications from discovery science to 
applied biotechnology and medicine.
