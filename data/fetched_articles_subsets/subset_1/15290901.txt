The human neurofilament medium (hNFM) subunit is one of the 3 neurofilament (NF) 
polypeptides, which are the most abundant intermediate filament (IF) proteins in 
post-mitotic neurons. The formation of neurofilamentous aggregates is a 
pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including the Lewy 
bodies found in Parkinson disease (PD). A Gly336Ser (G336S) variant in the rod 
domain of hNFM has recently been described in a patient with early-onset 
autosomal-dominant PD. In this study, we have generated a mammalian expression 
vector encoding the variant hNFM cDNA and characterized its effects on the 
formation of heteropolymeric IFs in heterologous cell lines. We have also 
investigated the distribution of the (G336S) hNFM variant protein in neuronal 
CAD cells, as well as the effects of the variant on the distribution of other 
cellular organelles and proteins. Our results demonstrate that the G336S variant 
does not affect the formation of IF networks nor the distribution of the variant 
hNFM protein. Our data suggest that if the G336S variant is involved in the 
development of PD, it does not appear to be due to defects in the assembly and 
distribution of NFs.
