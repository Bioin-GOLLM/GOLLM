Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare clinical syndrome of 
inappropriate immune activation which can present at any age and is commonly 
associated with other conditions of either excessive or impaired immune 
response, such as malignancy, infection, autoimmunity or immunodeficiency. In 
cases associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, an 
additional trigger such as acute infection or malignancy is frequently 
identified. We report a case of HLH presenting in a patient with uncontrolled 
HIV and reactivated hepatitis B infection, which to our knowledge has only been 
reported once before. Given challenges with diagnosis and its life-threatening 
course, HLH is an important consideration especially in critically ill patients 
with underlying HIV and nonspecific presentations such as fevers, cytopenias and 
encephalopathy.
