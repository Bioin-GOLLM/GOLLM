(1) Background: Circulating micro-RNAs (miRNAs) modulate the expression of 
molecules in diabetes. We evaluated the expression of serum miRNA-195-5p and 
-451a in diabetic patients with ischemic stroke and correlated them with two 
markers of brain tissue integrity. (2) Methods: Seventy-eight subjects with 
acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (40 with 
diabetes) were enrolled. Serum miRNA levels, brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) were assessed at 
admission and 24 and 72 h after a post-ischemic stroke, and were compared to 20 
controls. (3) Results: Both circulating miRNAs were two-fold up-regulated in 
diabetic AIS and TIA patients compared to non-diabetics. Their levels 
progressively decreased at 24 and 72 h in both AIS and TIA patients. 
Interestingly, in the non-diabetic TIA group, both circulating miRNAs, although 
higher than the controls, tended to achieve a complete decay after 72 h. 
Furthermore, miRNA-195-5p and miRNA-451a levels inversely correlated with both 
BDNF and VEGF-A serum levels. (4) Conclusions: These data show a different 
profile of both micro-RNAs in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients after acute 
ischemic stroke, suggesting their pivotal role in cerebrovascular ischemic 
attack.
