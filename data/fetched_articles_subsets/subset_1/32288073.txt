Receiving accurate and timely advice about extreme weather events can impact a 
person's likelihood to survive, cope with and minimise exposure. Advice-giving 
seems to be a common interpersonal strategy in weather commentaries in many 
Chinese newspapers, yet research into weather advice-giving is greatly lacking. 
This study investigated whether the discourse of advice-giving in newspaper 
weather commentaries differed depending on the newspaper source and/or on the 
weather reported. We focused on two popular metropolitan newspapers: Beijing 
Morning Post and Beijing Evening News. Forty texts from each source were chosen 
(20 for ordinary weather and 20 for extreme weather). Results showed that the 
advice given stems from a vast reservoir of advice themes, and we found clear 
differences depending on weather, with significantly more advice given during 
extreme events. We also found that Beijing Evening News, in general, provided 
more advice in their weather commentaries. Finally, writers who were prone to 
take an authoritative stance tended to increase their use of imperatives and 
"high-status" vocatives during extreme weather, whereas those who positioned 
themselves "with" their readers also used more imperatives, but did not change 
their vocative preferences.
