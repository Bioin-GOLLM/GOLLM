across Africa.

New insecticides have recently been produced to help control 
pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors including the pyrrole, chlorfenapyr. 
Monitoring the susceptibility of mosquito populations against this new product 
and potential cross-resistance with current insecticides is vital for better 
resistance management. In this study, we assessed the resistance status of the 
major malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus to chlorfenapyr 
across Africa and explored potential cross-resistance with known pyrethroid 
resistance markers. Efficacy of chlorfenapyr 100 µg/ml against An. gambiae and 
An. funestus from five Cameroonian locations, the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Ghana, Uganda, and Malawi was assessed using CDC bottle assays. Synergist assays 
were performed with PBO (4%), DEM (8%) and DEF (0.25%) and several 
pyrethroid-resistant markers were genotyped in both species to assess potential 
cross-resistance between pyrethroids and chlorfenapyr. Resistance to 
chlorfenapyr was detected in An. gambiae populations from DRC (Kinshasa) 
(mortality rate: 64.3 ± 7.1%) Ghana (Obuasi) (65.9 ± 7.4%), Cameroon (Mangoum; 
75.2 ± 7.7% and Nkolondom; 86.1 ± 7.4). In contrast, all An. funestus 
populations were fully susceptible. A negative association was observed between 
the L1014F-kdr mutation and chlorfenapyr resistance with a greater frequency of 
homozygote resistant mosquitoes among the dead mosquitoes after exposure 
compared to alive (OR 0.5; P = 0.02) whereas no association was found between 
GSTe2 (I114T in An. gambiae; L119F in An. funestus) and resistance to 
chlorfenapyr. A significant increase of mortality to chlorfenapyr 10 µg/ml was 
observed in An. funestus after to PBO, DEM and DEF whereas a trend for a 
decreased mortality was observed in An. gambiae after PBO pre-exposure. This 
study reveals a greater risk of chlorfenapyr resistance in An. gambiae 
populations than in An. funestus. However, the higher susceptibility in 
kdr-resistant mosquitoes points to higher efficacy of chlorfenapyr against the 
widespread kdr-based pyrethroid resistance.
