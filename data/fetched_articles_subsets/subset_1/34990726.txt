BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
single nucleotide polymorphisms disrupting microRNA targets (mirSNPs) can serve 
as predictive biomarkers for toxicity after radiotherapy for prostate cancer and 
whether these may be differentially predictive depending on radiation 
fractionation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 201 men treated with two forms of 
definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer at two institutions: 108 men 
received conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy (CF-RT) and 93 received 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Germline DNA was evaluated for the 
presence of functional mirSNPs. Random forest, boosted trees and elastic net 
models were developed to predict late grade ≥2 GU toxicity by the RTOG scale.
RESULTS: The crude incidence of late grade ≥2 GU toxicity was 16% after CF-RT 
and 15% after SBRT. An elastic net model based on 22 mirSNPs differentiated 
CF-RT patients at high risk (71.5%) versus low risk (7.5%) for toxicity, with an 
area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.76-0.81. An elastic net model based on 32 
mirSNPs differentiated SBRT patients at high risk (64.7%) versus low risk (3.9%) 
for toxicity, with an area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.81-0.87. These 
models were specific to treatment type delivered. Prospective studies are 
warranted to further validate these results.
CONCLUSION: Predictive models using germline mirSNPs have high accuracy for 
predicting late grade ≥2 GU toxicity after either CF-RT or SBRT, and are unique 
for each treatment, suggesting that germline predictors of late radiation 
sensitivity are fractionation-dependent. Prospective studies are warranted to 
further validate these results.
