Despite extensive efforts to address it, the vastness of uncharacterized 'dark 
matter' microbial genetic diversity can impact short-read sequencing based 
metagenomic studies. Population-specific biases in genomic reference databases 
can further compound this problem. Leveraging advances in hybrid assembly (using 
short and long reads) and Hi-C technologies in a cross-sectional survey, we 
deeply characterized 109 gut microbiomes from three ethnicities in Singapore to 
comprehensively reconstruct 4497 medium and high-quality metagenome assembled 
genomes, 1708 of which were missing in short-read only analysis and with >28× 
N50 improvement. Species-level clustering identified 70 (>10% of total) novel 
gut species out of 685, improved reference genomes for 363 species (53% of 
total), and discovered 3413 strains unique to these populations. Among the top 
10 most abundant gut bacteria in our study, one of the species and >80% of 
strains were unrepresented in existing databases. Annotation of biosynthetic 
gene clusters (BGCs) uncovered more than 27,000 BGCs with a large fraction 
(36-88%) unrepresented in current databases, and with several unique clusters 
predicted to produce bacteriocins that could significantly alter microbiome 
community structure. These results reveal significant uncharacterized gut 
microbial diversity in Southeast Asian populations and highlight the utility of 
hybrid metagenomic references for bioprospecting and disease-focused studies.
