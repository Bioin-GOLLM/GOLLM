AIM: Association between polymorphisms in GAD genes and methamphetamine (METH) 
dependence was investigated in the Thai population.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Genotypes of rs769404 and rs701492 in GAD1 and rs2236418 in 
GAD2 polymorphisms were determined in 100 METH-dependent male subjects and 102 
matched controls.
RESULTS: The genotype and allele frequencies of rs2236418 (GAD2) were associated 
with METH dependence and METH with psychosis, in which the G allele was related 
to increased risk. The presence of the rs769404-rs701492 (GAD1) C-C haplotype 
was associated with METH psychosis.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that genetic variability in GAD1 and GAD2 
contributes to risk of METH dependence and METH psychosis in the Thai population 
and indicates the role of the GABAergic system in these disorders.
