BACKGROUND: Progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dysfunction and death are 
common characteristics of retinal neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, 
hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCA1R, GPR81) was identified as a key 
modulator of mitochondrial function and cell survival. Thus, we aimed to test 
whether activation of HCA1R with 3,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) also promotes 
RGC survival and improves energy metabolism in mouse retinas.
METHODS: Retinal explants were treated with 5 mM of the HCA1R agonist, 3,5-DHBA, 
for 2, 4, 24, and 72 h. Additionally, explants were also treated with 15 mM of 
L-glutamate to induce toxicity. Tissue survival was assessed through lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) viability assays. RGC survival was measured through 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Total ATP levels were quantified through 
bioluminescence assays. Energy metabolism was investigated through stable 
isotope labeling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Lactate and 
nitric oxide levels were measured through colorimetric assays.
RESULTS: HCA1R activation with 3,5-DHBAincreased retinal explant survival. 
During glutamate-induced death, 3,5-DHBA treatment also increased survival. IHC 
analysis revealed that 3,5-DHBA treatment promoted RGC survival in retinal 
wholemounts. 3,5-DHBA treatment also enhanced ATP levels in retinal explants, 
whereas lactate levels decreased. No effects on glucose metabolism were 
observed, but small changes in lactate metabolism were found. Nitric oxide 
levels remained unaltered in response to 3,5-DHBA treatment.
CONCLUSION: The present study reveals that activation of HCA1R with 3,5-DHBA 
treatment has a neuroprotective effect specifically on RGCs and on 
glutamate-induced retinal degeneration. Hence, HCA1R agonist administration may 
be a potential new strategy for rescuing RGCs, ultimately preventing visual 
disability.
