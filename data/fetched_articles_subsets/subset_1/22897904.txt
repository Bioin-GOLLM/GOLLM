BACKGROUND: No studies of the clinical symptoms before starting therapy or of 
the effectiveness of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have been carried out of 
the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons that compare A(H1N1)pdm09 or the three 
circulating types of influenza virus.
METHODS: The clinical symptoms and duration of fever (body temperature ≥37·5°C) 
after the first dose of an NAI (oseltamivir, zanamivir, laninamivir) were 
analyzed. PCR was carried out for 365 patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 
2009-2010 season and for 388 patients with one of the three types of influenza 
circulating in the 2010-2011 season. IC50 for the three NAIs was also analyzed 
in 51 patients in the 2010-2011 season.
RESULTS: The peak body temperature was significantly higher in 2010-2011 than in 
2009-2010 for patients under 20 years with A(H1N1)pdm09, and in the 2010-2011 
season for children 15 years or younger with A(H1N1)pdm09 than for those with 
other virus types. The percentage of A(H1N1)pdm09 patients with loss of appetite 
or fatigue was significantly higher in 2010-2011 than in the previous season. 
The duration of fever was not affected by the kind of NAI or by age in multiple 
regression analysis. The percentage of patients afebrile at 48 hours after the 
first dose of NAI was significantly higher for A(H1N1)pdm09 than for A(H3N2) 
(laninamivir) or B (oseltamivir and laninamivir).
CONCLUSION: Although the clinical symptoms of A(H1N1)pdm09 were slightly more 
severe in the 2010-2011 season, the effectiveness of the NAIs remained high in 
comparison with 2009-2010 and with other types of seasonal influenza.
