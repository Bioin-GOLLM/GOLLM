Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) is an RNA/DNA-binding protein 
involved in chromatin remodeling, RNA processing and the DNA damage response. In 
addition, increased hnRNPK expression has been associated with tumor development 
and progression. A variety of post-translational modifications of hnRNPK have 
been identified and shown to regulate hnRNPK function, including 
phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and methylation. However, the 
functional significance of hnRNPK arginine methylation remains unclear. In the 
present study, we demonstrated that the methylation of two essential arginines, 
Arg296 and Arg299, on hnRNPK inhibited a nearby Ser302 phosphorylation that was 
mediated through the pro-apoptotic kinase PKCδ. Notably, the engineered U2OS 
cells carrying an Arg296/Arg299 methylation-defective hnRNPK mutant exhibited 
increased apoptosis upon DNA damage. While such elevated apoptosis can be 
diminished through addition with wild-type hnRNPK, we further demonstrated that 
this increased apoptosis occurred through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways 
and was p53 independent, at least in part. Here, we provide the first evidence 
that the arginine methylation of hnRNPK negatively regulates cell apoptosis 
through PKCδ-mediated signaling during DNA damage, which is essential for the 
anti-apoptotic role of hnRNPK in apoptosis and the evasion of apoptosis in 
cancer cells.
