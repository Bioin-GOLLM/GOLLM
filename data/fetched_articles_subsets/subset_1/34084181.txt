BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia over-activates glucose reduction to sorbitol by aldose 
reductase (ALR) leading to osmoregulation disruption and cellular damage that 
cause diabetic complications. We investigated the association of C106T 
polymorphism of ALR2 gene with the severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in 
Jordanian Type 2 diabetic patients in this case-control study at the 
Ophthalmology clinic of the National Centre of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and 
Genetics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 277 subjects participated in the study (100 
diabetics without retinopathy, 82 diabetics with retinopathy, and 95 controls). 
Blood samples were withdrawn followed by DNA extraction. C106T polymorphism was 
examined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length 
polymorphism and gel electrophoresis. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 
software using analysis of variance, multiple logistic regression or Chi-square 
test.
RESULTS: The CT and TT genotypes were significantly more prevalent in DR 
patients than those without DR (CT 50% vs. 38%, TT 16.7% vs. 8%, P = 0.02 and 
0.01, respectively). DR patients had T allele more frequently than those without 
it (41.7% vs. 27%, P = 0.007). Diabetics without retinopathy showed similar 
genotype and allele frequency to those of nondiabetic controls. No correlation 
between CT/TT genotypes and the severity of DR in affected subjects was found 
(χ2: 3.049, P = 0.550).
CONCLUSION: C106T polymorphism increased the risk to develop retinopathy in 
Jordanian Type 2 diabetic patients. T allele of ALR2 was associated with DR. The 
severity of DR did not show an association with this polymorphism.
