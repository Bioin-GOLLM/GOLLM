Hemoglobin (Hb) variants may be associated with low oxygen saturation and 
exacerbated episodes of anemia from common stressors such as viral infections. 
These attributes frequently cause increased clinical concern and unnecessary and 
expensive testing if not considered early in the evaluation of the patient. Some 
clinically significant Hb variants result in a normal Hb electrophoresis result, 
which can be method-dependent. Herein we describe a patient with low oxygen 
saturation and a history of hemolytic anemia who was subsequently found to carry 
a novel, unstable β-globin variant that we have named Hb Allentown 
[β137(H15)Val→Trp (GTG>TGG) HBB: c.412_413delinsTG, p.Val138Trp] for the place 
of identification of the variant. Hb Allentown is formed by a rare double 
nucleotide substitution within the same codon. Additionally, positive 
identification of rare Hb variants characterized by a single method is 
discouraged, as the Hb variant was misclassified as Hb S-South End or 
β6(A3)Glu→Val;β132(H10)Lys→Asn (HBB: c.[20A > T;399A > C]) by the initial 
laboratory.
