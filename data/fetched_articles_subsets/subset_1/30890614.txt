Mucosal and skin tissues form barriers to infection by most bacterial pathogens. 
Staphylococcus aureus causes diseases across these barriers in part dependent on 
the proinflammatory properties of superantigens. We showed, through use of a 
CRISPR-Cas9 CD40 knockout, that the superantigens toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 
(TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) B and C stimulated chemokine 
production from human vaginal epithelial cells (HVECs) through human CD40. This 
response was enhanced by addition of antibodies against CD40 through an unknown 
mechanism. TSST-1 was better able to stimulate chemokine (IL-8 and MIP-3α) 
production by HVECs than SEB and SEC, suggesting this is the reason for TSST-1's 
exclusive association with menstrual TSS. A mutant of TSST-1, K121A, caused TSS 
in a rabbit model when administered vaginally but not intravenously, emphasizing 
the importance of the local vaginal environment. Collectively, our data 
suggested that superantigens facilitate infections by disruption of mucosal 
barriers through their binding to CD40, with subsequent expression of 
chemokines. The chemokines facilitate TSS and possibly other epithelial 
conditions after attraction of the adaptive immune system to the local 
environment.IMPORTANCE Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a serious 
infectious disease associated with vaginal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus 
producing the exotoxin TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1). We show that menstrual TSS occurs 
after TSST-1 interaction with an immune costimulatory molecule called CD40 on 
the surface of vaginal epithelial cells. Other related toxins, where the entire 
family is called the superantigen family, bind to CD40, but not with a 
high-enough apparent affinity to cause TSS; thus, TSST-1 is the only exotoxin 
superantigen associated. Once the epithelial cells become activated by TSST-1, 
they produce soluble molecules referred to as chemokines, which in turn 
facilitate TSST-1 activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages to cause the 
symptoms of TSS. Identification of small-molecule inhibitors of the interaction 
of TSST-1 with CD40 may be useful so that they may serve as additives to medical 
devices, such as tampons and menstrual cups, to reduce the incidence of 
menstrual TSS.
