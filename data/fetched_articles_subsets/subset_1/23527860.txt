The AML1 gene is an essential transcription factor regulating the 
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells. Though at 
least 12 different alternatively spliced AML1 mRNAs are generated, three splice 
variants (AML1a, AML1b and AML1c) have been characterized. Here, using the 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with outward-facing primers, we 
identified a novel non-polyadenylated transcript from the AML1 gene, with exons 
5 and 6 scrambled. The novel transcript resisted RNase R digestion, indicating 
it is a circular RNA structure that may originate from products of mRNA 
alternative splicing. The expression of the novel transcript in different cells 
or cell lines of human and a number of other species matched those of the 
canonical transcripts. The discovery provides additional evidence that circular 
RNA could stably exist in vivo in human, and may also help to understand the 
mechanism of the regulation of the AML1 gene transcription.
