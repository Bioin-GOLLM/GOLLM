Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death 
worldwide. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has potential in regulating 
hypertension. Cocoa beans are rich in GABA, but GABA is being destroyed during 
roasting of cocoa beans and chocolate production. This study aimed to develop 
GABA-enriched dark chocolate by partially replacing sugar syrup with pure GABA 
powder at concentrations of 0.05 (F1), 0.10 (F2), and 0.15% (F3). The chocolate 
samples were incorporated with GABA after the heating and melting process of 
cocoa butter to maintain the viability and functionality of the GABA in the 
final product. The effects of GABA enrichment on the quality of chocolate in 
terms of nutritional, physical, shelf-life, and sensorial properties were 
studied. The inclusion of 0.15% GABA significantly increased the GABA content 
and angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitory effect of chocolate. The 
nutritional compositions of the control and GABA-enriched chocolates were almost 
similar. The addition of GABA significantly increased the hardness but did not 
affect the apparent viscosity and melting properties of chocolate. Accelerated 
shelf-life test results showed that all the chocolates stored at 20 and 30 Â°C 
were microbiologically safe for consumption for at least 21 days. Among the 
GABA-enriched chocolates, panellists preferred F2 the most followed by F3 and 
F1, owing to the glossiness and sweetness of F2. F3 with the highest GABA 
content (21.09 mg/100 g) and ACE inhibitory effect (79.54%) was identified as 
the best GABA-enriched dark chocolate.
