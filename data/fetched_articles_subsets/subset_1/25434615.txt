OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify whether stable single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) of various endocrine and immune molecules could be used as biomarkers 
associated with specific immune alterations and chronic stress measures in 
normal humans.
METHODS: A total of 207 volunteer participants answered stress questionnaire and 
gave peripheral blood cells for identification of SNPs in genes coding for 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR), beta 2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR), 
interferon-gamma receptors (IFNGR1, IFNGR2), and interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R). 
Immunoregulatory profiles were measured by flow cytometry and genotyping assays 
were performed by allelic discrimination real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Several significant differences were revealed in associations between 
stress marker and immune indicators based on SNP categories. For instance, Th1 
levels of the minor alleles of GR TthIIII (AA) and IFNGR2 Q64R (Arg/Arg) groups 
were positively associated with chronic stress (PSS) (p = 0.024 and 0.005, 
respectively) compared with wild type (WT) and negatively associated with PSS in 
the heterozygous genotypes of GR BclI and IL4R Ile50Val (p = 0.040 and p = 
0.052, respectively). Treg levels of the minor alleles of BclI (GG) and IFNGR1 
T-56C (CC) groups were positively associated with PSS (p = 0.045 and p = 0.010, 
respectively) and negatively associated in the minor allele (Val/Val) of IL4R 
Ile50Va and the heterozygous genotype of IL4R Q576R (p = 0.041 and p = 0.017, 
respectively) compared to WT.
CONCLUSION: The data support the notion that gene polymorphisms from various 
components of the psychoneuroendocrine-immune network may be useful as 
biomarkers to categorize individual stress-associated immune responses.
