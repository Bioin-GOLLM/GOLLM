Two novel CD1D alleles were identified in unrelated individuals from Morocco. 
They differ each from the common CD1D*01 allele by one nucleotide substitution 
in exon 2 resulting in one amino acid change in the G-ALPHA1-LIKE domain. 
According to the IMGT unique numbering for G domain, CD1D*03 has one nucleotide 
transition c136 > t in codon 46, with an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change 
(R46 > C) in the D-STRAND, whereas CD1D*04 has one transition c98 > t in codon 
33, with a threonine-to-methionine amino acid change (T33 > M) in the C-STRAND. 
This suggests that CD1D is more polymorphic than previously assumed.
