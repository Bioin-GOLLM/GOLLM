BACKGROUND: Idiopathic hypercalciuria (IHC) can be one of the causes of 
nocturnal enuresis (NE) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) ameliorates 
hypercalciuria.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic efficacy of HCT 
in boys with primary monosymptomatic NE (PMNE).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a randomized double-blind 
placebo-controlled clinical trial. A hundred boys with PMNE and IHC were 
randomly assigned into two groups of experimental (treated with HCT 1 mg/kg/day) 
and control and all patients were followed for 4 months for the number of 
wet-night episodes.
RESULTS: The mean numbers of wet-night episodes in the first (intervention: 8.34 
± 8.54, control: 9.1 ± 9.3, P = 0.3), second (7.1 ± 7.3, 7.9 ± 8.1, P = 0.4), 
third (7.8 ± 8, 7.9 ± 8.1, P = 0.1) and fourth (4.9 ± 5.1, 5.9 ± 6, P = 0.3) 
months were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the 
decrease in the average wet-night episodes during the 4 months of treatment in 
the intervention group (P = 0.019) unlike the control group. Not more 
significant compared to control group (P = 0.191). All patients who were treated 
by HCT became normocalciuric. However, in 21 patients the dose was increased to 
2 mg/kg/day.
CONCLUSIONS: Single daily dose of HCT is a safe and effective therapeutic option 
in the treatment of PMNE in children with IHC.
