Enzymes are often excellent drug targets. Yet drug pressure on an enzyme target 
often fosters the rise of cells with resistance-conferring mutations, some of 
which may compromise fitness and others that compensate to restore fitness. This 
review presents, first, a structural analysis of a diverse group of wild-type 
and mutant enzyme targets and, second, an in-depth analysis of five diverse 
targets to elucidate a broader perspective of the effects of 
resistance-conferring mutations on protein or organismal fitness. The structural 
analysis reveals that resistance-conferring mutations may introduce steric 
hindrance or eliminate critical interactions, as expected, but that they may 
also have indirect effects such as altering protein dynamics and enzyme 
kinetics. The structure-based development of the latest generation of inhibitors 
targeting HIV reverse transcriptase, P. falciparum and S. aureus dihydrofolate 
reductase, neuraminidase, and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine 
kinase, is highlighted to emphasize lessons that may be applied to future drug 
discovery to overcome mutation-induced resistance. Successful next-generation 
drugs tend to be more flexible and exploit a greater number of interactions 
mimicking those of the substrate with conserved residues.
