Study of MDR1 polymorphism in intron 6 and exon 12 of healthy individuals and 
patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases showed that the presence of 
mutant 6+139T allele is a factor determining resistance to lymphoproliferative 
diseases. Comparison of genotyping results in 53 patients and the data on the 
efficiency of drug therapy showed no significant associations of C(6+139)T and 
C(1236)T genotypes with drug resistance.
