Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for the patients with end-stage 
renal failure. Genetic factors, among others, can influence variability in 
response to immunosuppressive drugs. Nowadays, due to restrictive health 
resources, the question arises whether routine pharmacogenetic analyses should 
be done in the renal transplant recipients or not. The aim of this literature 
review was to present the up-to-date information considering the economic 
feasibility of pharmacogenetic testing in patients subjected to renal 
transplantation. The organization United Network for Organ Sharing in the US 
estimated that total costs per renal transplant concerning these analyses were 
$334,300 in 2014. Pharmacogenetic testing prior to treatment initiation could be 
helpful to predict and assess treatment response and the risks for adverse drug 
reactions. This kind of testing before treatment initiation seems to be one of 
the most promising applications of pharmacokinetics. Although pharmacogenetic 
tests were found to be a cost-effective or cost-saving strategy in many cases, 
some authors represent another opinion. However, if the real costs of renal 
transplantation are recognized, the application of these tests in the standard 
daily practice could be considered more realistic, which additionally emphasizes 
the importance of future studies assessing their cost effectiveness.
