Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from somatic cells by the 
introduction of Oct3/4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, in mouse 
and in human. The efficiency of this process, however, is low. Pluripotency can 
be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency. A p53 (also known as 
TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently 
shown to promote human iPS cell generation, but the specificity and mechanisms 
remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10% of transduced mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc 
retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free 
mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null 
background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T 
lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS 
cell generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes that 
are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of these genes 
demonstrate that the p53-p21 pathway serves as a barrier not only in 
tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell generation.
