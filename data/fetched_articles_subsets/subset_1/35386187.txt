SRD5A2 (steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2) mutation, which impairs 5α-reductase-2 
enzyme activity, is among the causes of 46,XY disorders of sex development 
(DSD). Here, we report a rare pathogenic mutation NM_000348.4:c.485A>C 
(NP_000339.2:p.His162Pro) of SRD5A2 gene in a compound heterozygous state first 
identified in a Vietnamese newborn with 5α-reductase-2 enzyme deficiency. We 
also first submitted this rare mutation to ClinVar database (VCV000973099.1). 
The patient presented with hyperpigmented labia-majora-like bifid scrotum, 
clitoris-like phallus, perineoscrotal hypospadias, and blind-ending vagina. The 
other mutation NM_000348.4:c.680G>A (NP_000339.2:p.Arg227Gln) was reported 
previously. This compound heterozygous mutation was first detected by 
next-generation sequencing. By Sanger sequencing, we confirmed that the c.485A>C 
mutation was maternal inherited, whereas the c.680G>A mutation was paternal 
inherited. Up to date, this is the first report of this rare compound 
heterozygous state of SRD5A2 c.485A>C and c.680G>A mutations in patients with 
46,XY DSD generally as well as in Vietnamese population particularly and is also 
the second report in the world carrying the pathogenic mutation 
NM_000348.4:c.485A>C (NP_000339.2:p.His162Pro). Our finding has enriched the 
understanding of the spectrum of SRD5A2 variants and phenotypic correlation in 
Asian patients with 46,XY DSD.
