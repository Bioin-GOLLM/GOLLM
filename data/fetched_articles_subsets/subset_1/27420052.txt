Among the different aquaporins (AQPs), human aquaporin-4 (hAQP4) has attracted 
the greatest interest in recent years as a new promising therapeutic target. 
Such a membrane protein is, in fact, involved in a multiple sclerosis-like 
immunopathology called Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) and in several disorders 
resulting from imbalanced water homeostasis such as deafness and cerebral edema. 
The gap of knowledge in its functioning and dynamics at the atomistic level of 
detail has hindered the development of rational strategies for designing hAQP4 
modulators. The application, lately, of molecular modeling has proved able to 
fill this gap providing a breeding ground to rationally address compounds 
targeting hAQP4. In this review, we give an overview of the important advances 
obtained in this field through the application of Molecular Dynamics (MD) and 
other complementary modeling techniques. The case studies presented herein are 
discussed with the aim of providing important clues for computational chemists 
and biophysicists interested in this field and looking for new challenges.
