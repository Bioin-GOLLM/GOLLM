BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder, 
which may stem from impair placentation. Renin-angiotensin system is one of the 
mediators of decidualization and trophoblastic proliferation. In the present 
study women with PE were studied in a comparison of normotensive controls to 
determine whether Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene I/D polymorphism 
affect the placental villi and umbilical cord formation with the assessment of 
biochemical and clinical risk factors.
METHODS: Total 400 blood (PE/controls = 200), 400 urine (PE/controls = 200), 90 
tissue samples of UC (PE = 50, controls = 40) and 90 placental tissue samples 
(PE = 50, controls = 40) were recruited. Histomorphological and 
Histomorphometric analysis were done for placental and umbilical cord tissues. 
Blood and serum parameters were analyzed, samples were genotyped for I/D 
polymorphism. Data were statistically analyzed by Independent sample t-test, 
Chi-square test and the odds ratio.
RESULTS: Histological study revealed significant increase (p < 0.001) in 
distance from Wharton jelly (in both artery and vein) and outer layer thickness 
of vein; significant reduction (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) in the lumen area of 
artery and vein. Abnormal villi, more syncytial knots (SK) and a significant 
decrease in elongated and large villi in PE placentas. Analysis of ACE gene 
determined that genotypic frequencies were statistically significant (p < 0.02) 
among both groups and DD genotype was predominant in the PE group.
CONCLUSION: Present study reveals that ACE I/D polymorphism might affect the 
normal placental villi and umbilical cord formation in women with PE. In 
addition, histological studies and genetic evaluation can provide useful 
information in the determination of various reasons and mechanisms involved in 
the pathogenesis of PE in Pakistan.
