BACKGROUND: Loss-of-function mutations in the imprinted gene MKRN3 represent the 
most common known genetic defects associated with central precocious puberty 
(CPP).
METHODS: We report the first case of a girl carrying an MKRN3 mutation detected 
in childhood and followed until the development of pubertal signs.
RESULTS: The girl was screened at the age of 4 years because of a positive 
family history; her sister had developed CPP at 6 years of age and was found to 
harbor the MKRN3 p.Pro161Argfs*16 mutation, inherited from their asymptomatic 
father. During close follow-up, she initially developed increased growth 
velocity at 6 years (9 cm/year), followed by a slightly increased basal 
luteinizing hormone level (0.4 mIU/ml) and, ultimately, clinical thelarche with 
rapid progression (Tanner stage 1-3) between 6.3 and 6.7 years. In the context 
of a loss-of-function MKRN3 mutation and a positive family history, these 
features established the diagnosis of CPP and supported the initiation of 
treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. The absence of 
significant bone age advancement, pubic or axillary hair, or behavioral or 
social problems could be ascribed to the early diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The identification of carriers of MKRN3 mutations may contribute to 
early diagnosis of CPP, facilitating treatment decisions and guiding genetic 
counseling and prompt intervention in familial cases.
