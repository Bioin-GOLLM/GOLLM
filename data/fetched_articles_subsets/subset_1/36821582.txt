Rotaviruses (RVs) preferentially replicate in the small intestine and frequently 
cause severe diarrheal disease, and the following enteric infection generally 
induces variable levels of protective systemic and mucosal immune responses in 
humans and other animals. Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) is a simian RV that was 
previously used as a human RV vaccine and has been extensively studied in mice. 
Although RRV replicates poorly in the suckling mouse intestine, infection 
induces a robust and protective antibody response. The recent availability of 
plasmid only-based RV reverse genetics systems has enabled the generation of 
recombinant RVs expressing foreign proteins. However, recombinant RVs have not 
yet been experimentally tested as potential vaccine vectors to immunize against 
other gastrointestinal pathogens in vivo. This is a newly available opportunity 
because several live-attenuated RV vaccines are already widely administered to 
infants and young children worldwide. To explore the feasibility of using RV as 
a dual vaccine vector, we rescued replication-competent recombinant RRVs 
harboring bicistronic gene segment 7 that encodes the native RV 
nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) protein and a human norovirus (HuNoV) VP1 protein 
or P domain from the predominant genotype GII.4. The rescued viruses expressed 
HuNoV VP1 or P protein in infected cells in vitro and elicited systemic and 
local antibody responses to HuNoV and RRV following oral infection of suckling 
mice. Serum IgG and fecal IgA from infected suckling mice bound to and 
neutralized both RRV and HuNoV. These findings have encouraging practical 
implications for the design of RV-based next-generation multivalent enteric 
vaccines to target HuNoV and other human enteric pathogens.
