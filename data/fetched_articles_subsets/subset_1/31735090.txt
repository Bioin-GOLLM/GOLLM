Introduction: In light of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, phage 
(bacteriophage) therapy has been recognized as a potential alternative or 
addition to antibiotics in Western medicine for use in humans.Areas covered: 
This review assessed the scientific literature on phage therapy published 
between 1 January 2007 and 21 October 2019, with a focus on the successes and 
challenges of this prospective therapeutic.Expert opinion: Efficacy has been 
shown in animal models and experimental findings suggest promise for the safety 
of human phagotherapy. Significant challenges remain to be addressed prior to 
the standardization of phage therapy in the West, including the development of 
phage-resistant bacteria; the pharmacokinetic complexities of phage; and any 
potential human immune response incited by phagotherapy.
