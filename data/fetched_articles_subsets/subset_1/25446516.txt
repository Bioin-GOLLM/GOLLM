Vertebrate hedgehog signaling is coordinated by the differential localization of 
the receptors patched-1 and Smoothened in the primary cilium. Cilia assembly is 
mediated by intraflagellar transport (IFT), and cilia defects disrupt hedgehog 
signaling, causing many structural birth defects. We generated Ift25 and Ift27 
knockout mice and show that they have structural birth defects indicative of 
hedgehog signaling dysfunction. Surprisingly, ciliary assembly is not affected, 
but abnormal hedgehog signaling is observed in conjunction with ciliary 
accumulation of patched-1 and Smoothened. Similarly, Smoothened accumulates in 
cilia on cells mutated for BBSome components or the BBS binding 
protein/regulator Lztfl1. Interestingly, the BBSome and Lztfl1 accumulate to 
high levels in Ift27 mutant cilia. Because Lztfl1 mutant cells accumulate BBSome 
but not IFT27, it is likely that Lztfl1 functions downstream of IFT27 to couple 
the BBSome to the IFT particle for coordinated removal of patched-1 and 
Smoothened from cilia during hedgehog signaling.
