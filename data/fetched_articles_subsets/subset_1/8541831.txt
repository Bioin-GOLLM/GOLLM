We have cloned, sequenced, and expressed cDNAs encoding wild type human 
glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase subunit, and have expressed a mutant enzyme found in 
a patient with glutaric acidemia type I. The mutant protein is expressed at the 
same level as the wild type in Escherichia coli, but has less than 1% of the 
activity of wild-type dehydrogenase. We also present evidence that the 
glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase transcript is alternatively spliced in human 
fibroblasts and liver; the alternatively spliced mRNA, when expressed in E.coli, 
encodes a stable but inactive protein. Purified expressed human glutaryl-CoA 
dehydrogenase has kinetic constants similar to those of the previously purified 
porcine dehydrogenase. The primary translation product from in vitro transcribed 
glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase mRNA is translocated into mitochondria and processed 
in the same manner as most other nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Human 
glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase shows 53% sequence similarity to porcine medium chain 
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and these similarities were utilized to predict 
structure-function relationships in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase.
