BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) with normal C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) is a 
rare disorder. Mutations of the gene encoding coagulation factor XII have been 
identified in a subset of patients with this condition. Our aim was to 
investigate mutations in the F12 gene in patients with HAE with normal C1-INH 
from Brazil.
METHODS: We studied 5 Brazilian families with index female patients who 
presented with recurrent angioedema with normal C1-INH and C4 levels. Genomic 
DNA was isolated from whole blood and PCR was performed. Mutations were detected 
by the sequencing of exon 9 of the F12 gene and allelic discrimination.
RESULTS: The c.983C>A (p.Thr328Lys) mutation was identified in 16 subjects, from 
4 of the 5 families studied, including 8 patients with symptoms of HAE with 
normal C1-INH (87.5% women) and 8 subjects asymptomatic for HAE (25% women). 
Mean age at onset of symptoms among the FXII-HAE patients was 13.8 years (range 
6-25 years). Recurrent abdominal pain (100%) and subcutaneous angioedema (87.5%) 
were the most frequent clinical presentations. Two patients presented with 
associated laryngeal edema. In keeping with previous observations in patients 
with both C1-INH-HAE and HAE with normal C1-INH, all 7 women with FXII-HAE 
reported triggering or worsening of symptoms upon intake of estrogen-containing 
oral contraceptives and/or pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time in Brazil a mutation in the F12 gene 
as a likely cause of HAE with normal C1-INH in patients with recurrent attacks 
of angioedema and/or abdominal pain. A higher frequency of abdominal pain 
attacks and onset of symptoms at a younger age were observed among Brazilian 
patients when compared to those from other parts of the world.
