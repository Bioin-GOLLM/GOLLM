Asparagine synthetase (ASN) is one of the key enzymes of nitrogen (N) metabolism 
in plants. The product of ASN is asparagine, which is one of the key compounds 
involved in N transport and storage in plants. Complete genome-wide analysis and 
classifications of the ASN gene family have recently been reported in different 
plants. However, little is known about the systematic analysis and expression 
profiling of ASN proteins in cotton development and N metabolism. Here, various 
bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify ASN gene family in cotton. In 
the cotton genome, forty-three proteins were found that determined ASN genes, 
comprising of 20 genes in Gossypium hirsutum (Gh), 13 genes in Gossypium 
arboreum, and 10 genes in Gossypium raimondii. The ASN encoded genes unequally 
distributed on various chromosomes with conserved glutamine amidotransferases 
and ASN domains. Expression analysis indicated that the majority of GhASNs were 
upregulated in vegetative and reproductive organs, fiber development, and N 
metabolism. Overall, the results provide proof of the possible role of the ASN 
genes in improving cotton growth, fiber development, and especially N metabolism 
in cotton. The identified hub genes will help to functionally elucidate the ASN 
genes in cotton development and N metabolism.
