The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in cancer 
as a result of genetic (e.g., amplifications, mutations, deletions) and 
epigenetic (e.g., methylation, regulation by non-coding RNAs) aberrations 
targeting its key components. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that tumors 
from different anatomical sites depend on the continued activation of this 
pathway for the maintenance of their malignant phenotype. The PI3K pathway 
therefore is an attractive candidate for therapeutic intervention, and 
inhibitors targeting different components of this pathway are in various stages 
of clinical development. Burgeoning data suggest that the genomic features of a 
given tumor determine its response to targeted small molecule inhibitors. 
Importantly, alterations of different components of the PI3K pathway may result 
in distinct types of dependencies and response to specific therapeutic agents. 
In this review, we will focus on the genomic determinants of response to PI3K, 
dual PI3K/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), mTOR, and AKT inhibitors in 
cancer identified in preclinical models and clinical trials to date, and the 
development of molecular tools for the stratification of cancer patients.
