Vitellogenin (Vg) has been implicated as a central protein in the immunity of 
egg-laying animals. Studies on a diverse set of species suggest that Vg supports 
health and longevity through binding to pathogens. Specific studies of honey 
bees (Apis mellifera) further indicate that the vitellogenin (vg) gene undergoes 
selection driven by local pathogen pressures. Determining the complete 3D 
structure of full-length Vg (flVg) protein will provide insights regarding the 
structure-function relationships underlying allelic variation. Honey bee Vg has 
been described in terms of function, and two subdomains have been structurally 
described, while information about the other domains is lacking. Here, we 
present a structure prediction, restrained by experimental data, of flVg from 
honey bees. To achieve this, we performed homology modeling and used AlphaFold 
before using a negative-stain electron microscopy map to restrict, orient, and 
validate our 3D model. Our approach identified a highly conserved Ca2+ 
-ion-binding site in a von Willebrand factor domain that might be central to Vg 
function. Thereafter, we used rigid-body fitting to predict the relative 
position of high-resolution domains in a flVg model. This mapping represents the 
first experimentally validated full-length protein model of a Vg protein and is 
thus relevant for understanding Vg in numerous species. Our results are also 
specifically relevant to honey bee health, which is a topic of global concern 
due to rapidly declining pollinator numbers.
