Our genome consists not only of protein-coding DNA, but also of the non-coding 
part that plays a very important role in the regulation of all cellular 
processes. A part of the non-coding genome comes with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), 
and disruption of the functional activity of these RNAs may be associated with 
oncogenesis in various cancer types. There exist two types of ncRNAs: small and 
long non-coding RNAs, which are classified according to their transcript length. 
Long non-coding metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, MALAT1 
RNA (NEAT2), is a long non-coding RNA of particular interest. The aforementioned 
transcript takes part in the regulation of numerous cellular processes and 
pathogenesis of different malignant tumors, including breast tumors. This review 
focuses on experimental and clinical studies into the role of MALAT1 in 
carcinogenesis and the progression of breast cancer.
