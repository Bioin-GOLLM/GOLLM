INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to examine the incidence of incidental papillary 
microcarcinoma (PMC) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in patients with 
benign multinodular goiter (MNG) and to compare their relationship with some 
prognostic factors from a new perspective.
METHODS: Bilateral total thyroidectomy (BTT) was used to evaluate the data of 
716 patients who underwent a surgery for MNG. The prognostic data for these 
tumors and the relationship between patients with bilateral and multifocal 
tumors were evaluated using statistical tests.
RESULTS: Papillary carcinomas were detected in 201 patients, PMC in 134 of them, 
and PTCs in 67. Bilaterality was more common in patients with PTCs than in those 
with PMC. The incidence of bilaterality in male patients with PTC was 
statistically more common. The presence of intra-tumoral lymphocytes was higher 
in multifocal PTC cases than in unifocal PTC cases.
CONCLUSION: The results revealed that the number of PMC s was high in incidental 
tumors, and patients with PTC with male sex, bilaterality, multifocality, and 
tumor capsule invasion were associated with poor prognosis.
