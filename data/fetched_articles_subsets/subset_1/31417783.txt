The syntheses and crystal structures of the title compounds, C14H8F4N2O2 and 
C14H8F4N2O3, are reported. In each crystal, the packing is driven by C-H⋯F 
inter-tactions, along with a variety of C-H⋯O, C-O⋯π, and C-F⋯π contacts. 
Hirshfeld surface analysis was conducted to aid in the visualization of these 
various influences on the packing: they showed that the largest contributions to 
the surface contacts arise from H⋯F/F⋯H inter-actions, followed by H⋯H and 
O⋯H/H⋯O.
