Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an ultra-rare 
disorder caused by mutations in TYMP, leading to a deficiency in thymidine 
phosphorylase and a subsequent systemic accumulation of thymidine and 
2'-deoxyuridine. Erythrocyte-encapsulated thymidine phosphorylase (EE-TP) is 
under clinical development as an enzyme replacement therapy for MNGIE. 
Bioanalytical methods were developed according to regulatory guidelines for the 
quantification of thymidine and 2'-deoxyuridine in plasma and urine using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for supporting the 
pharmacodynamic evaluation of EE-TP. Samples were deproteinized with 5% 
perchloric acid (v/v) and the supernatants analyzed using a Hypercarb column (30 
× 2.1 mm, 3 µm), with mobile phases of 0.1% formic acid in methanol and 0.1% 
formic acid in deionized water. Detection was conducted using an ion-spray 
interface running in positive mode. Isotopically labelled thymidine and 
2'-deoxyuridine were used as internal standards. Calibration curves for both 
metabolites showed linearity (r > 0.99) in the concentration ranges of 10-10,000 
ng/mL for plasma, and 1-50 µg/mL for urine, with method analytical performances 
within the acceptable criteria for quality control samples. The plasma method 
was successfully applied to the diagnosis of two patients with MNGIE and the 
quantification of plasma metabolites in three patients treated with EE-TP.
