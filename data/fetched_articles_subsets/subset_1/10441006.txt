Juvenile polyposis (JP) is a dominantly inherited condition characterized by the 
development of multiple hamartomatous tumors, juvenile polyps, in the 
gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of SMAD4 
in JP. DNA from four unrelated JP kindreds and three sporadic JP cases was 
available for mutation screening. Two truncating defects (one in a familial and 
one in a sporadic case) and one missense change (in a familial case) that was 
absent in 55 control samples were detected. To study the possibility that 
germline mutations in other genes encoding different components of the TGF-beta 
signaling pathway may be present in these JP patients, mutation analyses of the 
SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD7 genes were also performed. No mutations of these genes 
were detected in any of the patients. Our results confirm that SMAD4 is a gene 
predisposing to JP and suggest the existence of further JP loci other than the 
SMAD2, SMAD3, or SMAD7 genes. Genes Chromosomes Cancer 26:54-61, 1999.
