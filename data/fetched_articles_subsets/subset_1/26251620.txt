HIV-1 infection afflicts more than 35 million people worldwide, according to 
2014 estimates from the World Health Organization. For those individuals who 
have access to antiretroviral therapy, these drugs can effectively suppress, but 
not cure, HIV-1 infection. Indeed, the only documented case for an HIV/AIDS cure 
was a patient with HIV-1 and acute myeloid leukemia who received allogeneic 
hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from a graft that carried the 
HIV-resistant CCR5-∆32/∆32 mutation. Other attempts to establish a cure for 
HIV/AIDS using HCT in patients with HIV-1 and malignancy have yielded mixed 
results, as encouraging evidence for virus eradication in a few cases has been 
offset by poor clinical outcomes due to the underlying cancer or other 
complications. Such clinical strategies have relied on HIV-resistant 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that harbor the natural CCR5-∆32/∆32 
mutation or that have been genetically modified for HIV-resistance. 
Nevertheless, HCT with HIV-resistant cord blood remains a promising option, 
particularly with inventories of CCR5-∆32/∆32 units or with genetically 
modified, human leukocyte antigen-matched cord blood.
