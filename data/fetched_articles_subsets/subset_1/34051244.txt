OBJECTIVE: Viral nucleic acid detection by real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the current standard method for diagnosis of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to low viral load in some COVID-19 patients, 
false negative results from this method have been repeatedly reported.
METHOD: In this study, we compared the sensitivity and specificity of digital 
PCR (dPCR) in simulated samples and clinical samples with qPCR assay through a 
series of vigorous tests.
RESULTS: The results showed that dPCR was more sensitive than qPCR especially 
for samples with low viral load (≤3 copies). In addition, dPCR had similar 
specificity as qPCR and could effectively distinguish other human coronaviruses 
and influenza virus from SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, dPCR was more sensitive 
than qPCR in detecting the virus in the "negative" samples from recurrent 
COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, dPCR could serve as a powerful complement to the 
current qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for the samples with 
extremely low viral load, such as recurrent COVID-19 patients.
