Exosomes are generated within the multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) as 
intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and secreted during the fusion of MVEs with the 
cell membrane. The mechanisms of exosome biogenesis remain poorly explored. Here 
we identify that RAB31 marks and controls an ESCRT-independent exosome pathway. 
Active RAB31, phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), engages 
flotillin proteins in lipid raft microdomains to drive EGFR entry into MVEs to 
form ILVs, which is independent of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required 
for transport) machinery. Active RAB31 interacts with the SPFH domain and drives 
ILV formation via the Flotillin domain of flotillin proteins. Meanwhile, RAB31 
recruits GTPase-activating protein TBC1D2B to inactivate RAB7, thereby 
preventing the fusion of MVEs with lysosomes and enabling the secretion of ILVs 
as exosomes. These findings establish that RAB31 has dual functions in the 
biogenesis of exosomes: driving ILVs formation and suppressing MVEs degradation, 
providing an exquisite framework to better understand exosome biogenesis.
