For a precise diagnosis of infant hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), 
neuroimaging is required. The nature and time of the brain injury, the imaging 
modalities used, and the timing of their application all affect the therapeutic 
usefulness of neuroimaging in neonatal HIE. Most neonatal intensive care units 
(NICUs) across the world have access to cranial ultrasound (cUS), a safe, 
low-cost piece of technology that may be used at the patient's bedside. Infants 
undergoing active therapeutic hypothermia (TH) must undergo a cUS to be screened 
for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), according to the clinical practice 
guidelines. The guidelines advise brain cUS on days 4 and 10-14 of life after 
hypothermia therapy is finished in order to thoroughly assess the nature and 
severity of any brain impairment. Early cUS is meant to rule out major ICH, 
which is listed in the local guideline for TH as a relative exclusion factor. 
This study questions whether cUS should be a required screening method before 
the start of TH.
