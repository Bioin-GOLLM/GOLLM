INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like 
episodes (MELAS) is a multisystemic mitochondrial disorder that usually presents 
in childhood. Patients can have a wide array of neurological symptoms when 
presenting with stroke-like episodes, and imaging characteristics during the 
episodes can overlap with different neurological disorders.
CASE REPORT: A 61-year-old woman presented with communication difficulties 
consistent with auditory agnosia and was found to have bitemporal abnormalities 
on imaging that first raised the concern for herpes simplex virus encephalitis. 
Further work-up, in conjunction with the patient's past medical and family 
history, suggested a mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial full genome analysis 
revealed m.3243A>G variant in the MT-TL1 gene, with 6% heteroplasmy in blood 
leading to a diagnosis of MELAS.
CONCLUSIONS: MELAS is a disorder with clinical variability. Neuroimaging studies 
during stroke-like episodes in MELAS can provide significant clues to the 
underlying disorder. Although patients typically present in childhood, the first 
stroke-like episode can occur later in life in some patients, potentially 
related to a lower heteroplasmy level.
