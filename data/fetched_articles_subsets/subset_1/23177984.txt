SLC4A gene family proteins include bicarbonate transporters that move HCO(3)(-) 
across the plasma membrane and regulate intracellular pH and transepithelial 
movement of acid-base equivalents. These transporters are Cl/HCO(3) exchangers, 
electrogenic Na/HCO(3) cotransporters, electroneutral Na/HCO(3) cotransporters, 
and Na(+)-driven Cl/HCO(3) exchanger. Studies of the bicarbonate transporters 
in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated their physiological importance for 
acid-base homeostasis at the cellular and systemic levels. Recent advances in 
structure/function analysis have also provided valuable information on domains 
or motifs critical for regulation, ion translocation, and protein topology. This 
chapter focuses on the molecular mechanisms of ion transport along with 
associated structural aspects from mutagenesis of particular residues and from 
chimeric constructs. Structure/function studies have helped to understand the 
mechanism by which ion substrates are moved via the transporters. This chapter 
also describes some insights into the structure of SLC4A1 (AE1) and SLC4A4 
(NBCe1) transporters. Finally, as some SLC4A transporters exist in concert with 
other proteins in the cells, the structural features associated with 
protein-protein interactions are briefly discussed.
