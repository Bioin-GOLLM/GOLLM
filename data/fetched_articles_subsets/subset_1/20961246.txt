We report an autosomal recessive lethal syndrome characterized by multiple fetal 
malformations, the most obvious anomalies being the defective face and seemingly 
absent limbs, which are bound to the trunk and encased under the skin. We 
identified the molecular defect that causes this syndrome, using a combined 
strategy of gene-expression arrays, candidate-gene analysis, clinical studies, 
and genealogic investigations. A point mutation in two affected fetuses led to 
the loss of the conserved helix–loop–helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK), also known 
as IκB kinase α. CHUK has an essential role in the development of skin epidermis 
and its derivatives, along with various other morphogenetic events. (Funded by
