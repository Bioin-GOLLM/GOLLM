BACKGROUND: Halo nevi are often considered benign, and the possibility of 
malignancy is not always clear to practitioners. We present two case reports 
suggesting that a halo nevus appearance can be seen in melanoma, even in young 
adults. A literature search for halo nevi revealing melanoma shows that this is 
a very rare condition. Case presentation. This report of two young patients 
indicates the importance of obtaining a detailed history to detect warning signs 
such as itching, pain, spontaneous bleeding, and previous alterations according 
to the patient, including a previously totally black colour in an already fully 
regressed melanoma.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of a halo nevus being malignant is higher if there is only 
one unique halo nevus and no personal or familial history of vitiligo. We 
postulate that a regressing atypical nevus or a regressing melanoma may be 
induced by an immunologic reaction as halo nevus type of clinical picture.
