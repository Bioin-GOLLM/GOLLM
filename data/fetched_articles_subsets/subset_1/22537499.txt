β-Catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, has been implicated in 
the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in mice, but its precise 
role in this process remains unclear. Here we use a β-catenin gain-of-function 
mouse model to stabilize β-catenin selectively in either skeletal muscles or 
motor neurons. We found that β-catenin stabilization in skeletal muscles 
resulted in increased motor axon number and excessive intramuscular nerve 
defasciculation and branching. In contrast, β-catenin stabilization in motor 
neurons had no adverse effect on motor innervation pattern. Furthermore, 
stabilization of β-catenin, either in skeletal muscles or in motor neurons, had 
no adverse effect on the formation and function of the NMJ. Our findings 
demonstrate that β-catenin levels in developing muscles in mice are crucial for 
proper muscle innervation, rather than specifically affecting synapse formation 
at the NMJ, and that the regulation of muscle innervation by β-catenin is 
mediated by a non-cell autonomous mechanism.
