Asgardarchaeota harbour many eukaryotic signature proteins and are widely 
considered to represent the closest archaeal relatives of eukaryotes. Whether 
similarities between Asgard archaea and eukaryotes extend to their viromes 
remains unknown. Here we present 20 metagenome-assembled genomes of 
Asgardarchaeota from deep-sea sediments of the basin off the Shimokita 
Peninsula, Japan. By combining a CRISPR spacer search of metagenomic sequences 
with phylogenomic analysis, we identify three family-level groups of viruses 
associated with Asgard archaea. The first group, verdandiviruses, includes 
tailed viruses of the class Caudoviricetes (realm Duplodnaviria); the second, 
skuldviruses, consists of viruses with predicted icosahedral capsids of the 
realm Varidnaviria; and the third group, wyrdviruses, is related to 
spindle-shaped viruses previously identified in other archaea. More than 90% of 
the proteins encoded by these viruses of Asgard archaea show no sequence 
similarity to proteins encoded by other known viruses. Nevertheless, all three 
proposed families consist of viruses typical of prokaryotes, providing no 
indication of specific evolutionary relationships between viruses infecting 
Asgard archaea and eukaryotes. Verdandiviruses and skuldviruses are likely to be 
lytic, whereas wyrdviruses potentially establish chronic infection and are 
released without host cell lysis. All three groups of viruses are predicted to 
play important roles in controlling Asgard archaea populations in deep-sea 
ecosystems.
