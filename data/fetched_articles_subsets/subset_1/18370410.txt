The initial step in the l-kynurenine pathway is oxidation of l-tryptophan to 
N-formylkynurenine and is catalyzed by one of two heme enzymes, tryptophan 
2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Here, we address the 
role of the conserved active site Ser167 residue in human IDO (S167A and S167H 
variants), which is replaced with a histidine in other mammalian and bacterial 
TDO enzymes. Our kinetic and spectroscopic data for S167A indicate that this 
residue is not essential for O 2 or substrate binding, and we propose that 
hydrogen bond stabilization of the catalytic ferrous-oxy complex involves active 
site water molecules in IDO. The data for S167H show that the ferrous-oxy 
complex is dramatically destabilized in this variant, which is similar to the 
behavior observed in human TDO [Basran et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 
4752-4760], and that this destabilization essentially destroys catalytic 
activity. New kinetic data for the wild-type enzyme also identify the ternary 
[enzyme-O 2-substrate] complex. The data reveal significant differences between 
the IDO and TDO enzymes, and the implications of these results are discussed in 
terms of our current understanding of IDO and TDO catalysis.
