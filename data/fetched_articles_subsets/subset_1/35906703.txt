Stopgain substitutions are the third-largest class of monogenic human disease 
mutations and often examined first in patient exomes. Existing computational 
stopgain pathogenicity predictors, however, exhibit poor performance at the high 
sensitivity required for clinical use. Here, we introduce a new classifier, 
termed X-CAP, which uses a novel training methodology and unique feature set to 
improve the AUROC by 18% and decrease the false-positive rate 4-fold on large 
variant databases. In patient exomes, X-CAP prioritizes causal stopgains better 
than existing methods do, further illustrating its clinical utility. X-CAP is 
available at https://github.com/bejerano-lab/X-CAP .
