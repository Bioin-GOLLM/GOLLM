Mutations in Pol γ represent a major cause of human mitochondrial diseases, 
especially those affecting the nervous system in adults and in children. 
Recessive mutations in Pol γ represent nearly half of those reported to date, 
and they are nearly uniformly distributed along the length of the POLG1 gene 
(Human DNA Polymerase gamma Mutation Database); the majority of them are linked 
to the most severe form of POLG syndrome, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. In this 
report, we assess the structure-function relationships for recessive disease 
mutations by reviewing existing biochemical data on site-directed mutagenesis of 
the human, Drosophila and yeast Pol γs, and their homologs from the family A DNA 
polymerase group. We do so in the context of a molecular model of Pol γ in 
complex with primer-template DNA, which we have developed based upon the 
recently solved crystal structure of the apoenzyme form. We present evidence 
that recessive mutations cluster within five distinct functional modules in the 
catalytic core of Pol γ. Our results suggest that cluster prediction can be used 
as a diagnosis-supporting tool to evaluate the pathogenic role of new Pol γ 
variants.
