Several lines of evidence suggest a molecular role of -1438A/G single nucleotide 
polymorphism in the 5-HTR2A gene promoter (rs6311) in regulating the expression 
of this gene, making rs6311 polymorphism a promising candidate for an 
association study. We looked for a possible association between rs6311 
polymorphism and major depressive disorder (MDD) in a northeastern Thai 
population. We included 180 patients with MDD and 183 unrelated healthy controls 
in our study. Genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP. We found no significant 
differences between the two groups with regard to both genotype distributions 
(chi(2) = 1.32, d.f. = 2, P = 0.516) and allele frequencies (chi(2) = 0.01, d.f. 
= 1, P = 0.913, odds ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.67-1.39). 
Therefore, this single nucleotide polymorphism appears not to be involved in the 
etiology of MDD.
