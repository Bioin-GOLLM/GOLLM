HtaA is a heme-binding protein that is part of the heme uptake system in 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae. HtaA contains two conserved regions (CR1 and CR2). 
It has been previously reported that both domains can bind heme; the CR2 domain 
binds hemoglobin more strongly than the CR1 domain. In this study, we report the 
biophysical characteristics of HtaA-CR2. UV-visible spectroscopy and resonance 
Raman experiments are consistent with this domain containing a single heme that 
is bound to the protein through an axial tyrosine ligand. Mutants of conserved 
tyrosine and histidine residues (Y361, H412, and Y490) have been studied. These 
mutants are isolated with very little heme (≤5%) in comparison to the wild-type 
protein (~20%). Reconstitution after removal of the heme with butanone gave an 
alternative form of the protein. The HtaA-CR2 fold is very stable; it was 
necessary to perform thermal denaturation experiments in the presence of 
guanidinium hydrochloride. HtaA-CR2 unfolds extremely slowly; even in 6.8M 
GdnHCl at 37°C, the half-life was 5h. In contrast, the apo forms of WT HtaA-CR2 
and the aforementioned mutants unfolded at much lower concentrations of GdnHCl, 
indicating the role of heme in stabilizing the structure and implying that heme 
transfer is effected only to a partner protein in vivo.
