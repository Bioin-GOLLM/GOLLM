Engineered T cells expressing tumor-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) are 
emerging as a mode of personalized cancer immunotherapy that requires 
identification of TCRs against the products of known driver mutations and novel 
mutations in a timely fashion. We present a nonviral and non-next-generation 
sequencing platform for rapid, and efficient neoantigen-specific TCR 
identification and evaluation that does not require the use of recombinant 
cloning techniques. The platform includes an innovative method of TCRα detection 
using Sanger sequencing, TCR pairings and the use of TCRα/β gene fragments for 
putative TCR evaluation. Using patients' samples, we validated and compared our 
new methods head-to-head with conventional approaches used for TCR discovery. 
Development of a unique demultiplexing method for identification of TCRα, 
adaptation of synthetic TCRs for gene transfer, and a reliable reporter system 
significantly shortens TCR discovery time over conventional methods and 
increases throughput to facilitate testing prospective personalized TCRs for 
adoptive cell therapy.
