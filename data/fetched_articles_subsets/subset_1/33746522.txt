BACKGROUND: Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the 
leading cause of end stage renal disease in children. Diagnosis by genetic 
testing has proven challenging due to its genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, 
as well as incomplete penetrance. We report a case on a 16-months old female 
with a history of renal cysts and a PAX2 mutation.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with a prenatal diagnosis of Potter 
sequence and a postnatal diagnosis of renal cysts. An ultrasound at 20 weeks 
gestation revealed right renal agenesis and possible left renal dysplasia. Post 
natal genetic analyses identified a novel mutation in PAX2.
CONCLUSION: Cystic kidney disease is often underdiagnosed due to its variable 
expressivity and wide range of clinical manifestations; PAX2 genetic screening 
should be considered for all patients with CAKUT.
