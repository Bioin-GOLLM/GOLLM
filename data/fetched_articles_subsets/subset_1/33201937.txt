The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a serious public health 
problem and will continue to be until effective drugs and/or vaccines are 
available. The rational development of drugs critically depends on our 
understanding of disease mechanisms, that is, the physiology and pathophysiology 
underlying the function of the organ targeted by the virus. Since the beginning 
of the pandemic, tireless efforts around the globe have led to numerous 
publications on the virus, its receptor, its entry into the cell, its cytopathic 
effects, and how it triggers innate and native immunity but the role of apical 
sodium transport mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) during the 
early phases of the infection in the airways has received little attention. We 
propose a pathophysiological model that defines the possible role of ENaC in 
this process.
