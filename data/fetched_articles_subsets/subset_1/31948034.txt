Although tung oil is renewable, with an abundant production and low price in 
China, and it is used to synthesize different polyols for rigid polyurethane 
foam (RPUF), it remains a challenge to improve the properties of RPUF by 
redesigning the formula. Therefore, we propose four novel compounds to 
strengthen the properties of RPUF, such as the catalyst-free synthesis of tung 
oil-based polyol (PTOK), aluminum phosphate micro-capsule (AM), silica 
micro-capsule (SiM), and grafted epoxidized monoglyceride of tung oil on the 
surface of SiO2 (SiE), which were designed and introduced into the RPUF. Because 
of the PTOK with a catalytic function, the foaming process of some RPUF samples 
was catalyst-free. The results show that the incorporation of AM, SiM, and SiE, 
respectively, endow RPUF with a better thermal stability at a high temperature, 
and the T5%, Tmax1, and Tmax2 of RPUF appeared to be reduced, however, the Tmax3 
and residue rate at 800 Â°C were improved, which may have a positive effect on 
the extension of the rescue time in case of fire, and the limiting oxygen index 
(LOI) value was increased to 22.6%. The formula, containing 25% PTOK made the 
RPUF environment-friendly. The results were obtained by comparing the pore size 
and mechanical properties of the RPUF-the AM had a better dispersion in the 
foam, and the foam obtained a better mechanical, thermal, and flame retardancy.
