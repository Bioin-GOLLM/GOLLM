Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders affecting the 
β-globin gene, resulting in the polymerization of hemoglobin and subsequent 
sickling of the red blood cell. Renal disease, the most common complication in 
SCD, begins in childhood with glomerular hyperfiltration and then progresses 
into albuminuria, a fast decline of glomerular filtration, and renal failure in 
adults. This mini-review focuses on glomerular filtration abnormalities and the 
mechanisms of hyperfiltration, explores genetic modifiers and methods of 
estimating glomerular filtration rates, and examines novel biomarkers of 
glomerular filtration in SCD.
