Antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin) binds to and activates V2 receptors 
in renal collecting tubule cells. Subsequent stimulation of the Gs/adenylyl 
cyclase system promotes insertion of water pores into the luminal membrane and 
thereby reabsorption of fluid. In congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 
(CNDI), an X-linked recessive disorder, the kidney fails to respond to arginine 
vasopressin. Here we report that an affected male of a family with CNDI has a 
deletion in the open reading frame of the V2 receptor gene, causing a frame 
shift and premature termination of translation in the third intracellular loop 
of the receptor protein. A normal receptor gene was found in the patient's 
brother. Both the normal and the mutant allele were detected in his mother. A 
different mutation, causing a codon change in the third transmembrane domain of 
the V2 receptor, was found in the open reading frame of an affected male but not 
in the unaffected brother belonging to another family suffering from CNDI.
