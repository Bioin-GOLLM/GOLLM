Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are a group of disorders 
associated with intractable seizures, brain development, and functional 
abnormalities, and in some cases, premature death. Pathogenic human germline 
biallelic mutations in tumor suppressor WW domain-containing oxidoreductase 
(WWOX) are associated with a relatively mild autosomal recessive spinocerebellar 
ataxia-12 (SCAR12) and a more severe early infantile WWOX-related epileptic 
encephalopathy (WOREE). In this study, we generated an in vitro model for DEEs, 
using the devastating WOREE syndrome as a prototype, by establishing brain 
organoids from CRISPR-engineered human ES cells and from patient-derived iPSCs. 
Using these models, we discovered dramatic cellular and molecular CNS 
abnormalities, including neural population changes, cortical differentiation 
malfunctions, and Wnt pathway and DNA damage response impairment. Furthermore, 
we provide a proof of concept that ectopic WWOX expression could potentially 
rescue these phenotypes. Our findings underscore the utility of modeling 
childhood epileptic encephalopathies using brain organoids and their use as a 
unique platform to test possible therapeutic intervention strategies.
