Alveolar epithelial type 2 cell (AEC2) dysfunction is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of adult and pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD), including 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, identification of 
disease-initiating mechanisms has been impeded by inability to access primary 
AEC2s early on. Here, we present a human in vitro model permitting investigation 
of epithelial-intrinsic events culminating in AEC2 dysfunction, using 
patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying an 
AEC2-exclusive disease-associated variant (SFTPCI73T). Comparing syngeneic 
mutant versus gene-corrected iPSCs after differentiation into AEC2s (iAEC2s), we 
find that mutant iAEC2s accumulate large amounts of misprocessed and 
mistrafficked pro-SFTPC protein, similar to in vivo changes, resulting in 
diminished AEC2 progenitor capacity, perturbed proteostasis, altered 
bioenergetic programs, time-dependent metabolic reprogramming, and nuclear 
factor κB (NF-κB) pathway activation. Treatment of SFTPCI73T-expressing iAEC2s 
with hydroxychloroquine, a medication used in pediatric ILD, aggravates the 
observed perturbations. Thus, iAEC2s provide a patient-specific preclinical 
platform for modeling the epithelial-intrinsic dysfunction at ILD inception.
