In the title compound, C(14)H(25)NO(11)·2H(2)O, the primary hydroxyl group 
connected to the anomeric C atom of the N-acetyl-β-d-glucopyran-ose residue 
exhibits positional disorder, with occupancy factors for the α and β anomers of 
0.77 and 0.23, respectively. The two torsion angles (Φ and Ψ) and the bridge 
angle (τ) that describe conformation of the glycosidic linkage between the 
galactopyran-ose and glucopyran-ose rings are Φ = -81.6 (3)°, Ψ = 118.1 (2)° and 
τ = 115.2 (2)°. Two water mol-ecules stabilize the mol-ecular packing by forming 
hydrogen bonds with the saccharide residues.
