Several studies have reported that amyloid fibrils in human semen formed from a 
naturally occurring peptide fragment of prostatic acidic phosphatase 
(PAP248-286), known as semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI), could 
dramatically enhance human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. 
Accordingly, SEVI might serve as a novel target for new antiviral drugs or 
microbicide candidates for the prevention of sexually transmitted HIV. 
Theoretically, a special anti-PAP or anti-SEVI antibody could reduce the 
enhancement of viral infection by blocking the binding of HIV and SEVI fibrils. 
Here, 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride modified anti-PAP248-286 antibody, named 
HP-API, exhibited broad-spectrum and highly effective anti-HIV-1 activities on 
different subtypes and tropism. By using time-of-addition, cell-cell fusion and 
a single-cycle HIV-1 infection assays, we demonstrated that HP-API is an HIV-1 
entry/fusion inhibitor. Mechanism studies suggest that HP-API inhibited HIV-1 
entry/fusion by targeting both HIV-1 gp120 envelop and CD4 receptor on the host 
cell specifically. It is noteworthy that HP-API abrogated the formation of SEVI 
fibrils and partially interfered with SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 
infection. Based on these findings, HP-API could be considered a bifunctional 
HIV-1 entry/fusion inhibitor with high potential.
