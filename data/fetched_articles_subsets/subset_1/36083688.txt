Cell polarity relies on the asymmetric distribution of the conserved PAR 
proteins, which is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. 
While the kinases involved have been well studied, the role of phosphatases 
remains poorly understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, phosphorylation of 
the posterior PAR-2 protein by the atypical protein kinase PKC-3 inhibits PAR-2 
cortical localization. Polarity establishment depends on loading of PAR-2 at the 
posterior cortex. We show that the PP1 phosphatases GSP-1 and GSP-2 are required 
for polarity establishment in embryos. We find that codepletion of GSP-1 and 
GSP-2 abrogates the cortical localization of PAR-2 and that GSP-1 and GSP-2 
interact with PAR-2 via a PP1 docking motif in PAR-2. Mutating this motif in 
vivo, to prevent binding of PAR-2 to PP1, abolishes cortical localization of 
PAR-2, while optimizing this motif extends PAR-2 cortical localization. Our data 
suggest a model in which GSP-1/-2 counteracts PKC-3 phosphorylation of PAR-2, 
allowing its cortical localization at the posterior and polarization of the 
one-cell embryo.
