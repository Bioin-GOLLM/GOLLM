Identification of the initiation site of poliovirus polyprotein synthesis.

Dorner AJ, Dorner LF, Larsen GR, Wimmer E, Anderson CW.

The complete nucleotide sequence of poliovirus RNA has a long open reading frame 
capable of encoding the precursor polyprotein NCVP00. The first AUG codon in 
this reading frame is located 743 nucleotides from the 5' end of the RNA and is 
preceded by eight AUG codons in all three reading frames. Because all proteins 
that map at the amino terminus of the polyprotein (P1-1a, VP0, and VP4) are 
blocked at their amino termini and previous studies of ribosome binding have 
been inconclusive, direct identification of the initiation site of protein 
synthesis was difficult. We separated and identified all of the tryptic peptides 
of capsid protein VP4 and correlated these peptides with the amino acid sequence 
predicted to follow the AUG codon at nucleotide 743. Our data indicate that VP4 
begins with a blocked glycine that is encoded immediately after the AUG codon at 
nucleotide 743. An S1 nuclease analysis of poliovirus mRNA failed to reveal a 
splice in the 5' region. We concluded that synthesis of the poliovirus 
polyprotein is initiated at nucleotide 743, the first AUG codon in the long open 
reading frame.
