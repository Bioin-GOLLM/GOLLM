Methytransferase-like proteins 9 (METTL9) has been characterized as an oncogene 
in several cancers, however, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains 
unknown. Here, we investigated the function and molecular mechanism of METTL9 in 
HCC. We showed that METTL9 expression was elevated in HCC, and its high 
expression was associated with poor survival outcomes. Knockdown of METTL9 
observed a significant inhibition of HCC cell viability, migration, and invasion 
both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, METTL9 overexpression HCC cells obtained 
stronger abilities in cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, we 
discovered that METTL9 knockdown led to a reduction in the expression level of 
SLC7A11, a key suppressor of ferroptosis, in turn, promoted ferroptosis in HCC 
cells, impeding the progression of HCC. Moreover, we have proved that targeting 
METTL9 could significantly restrain the growth of HCC patient-derived xenograft 
(PDX). Our study established METTL9 as a critical role in promoting HCC 
development and provides a foundation for further investigation and potential 
therapeutic interventions targeting ferroptosis in HCC.
