Myofibril breakdown is a fundamental cause of muscle wasting and inevitable 
sequel of aging and disease. We demonstrated that myofibril loss requires 
depolymerization of the desmin cytoskeleton, which is activated by 
phosphorylation. Here, we developed a mass spectrometry-based kinase-trap assay 
and identified glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3-β) as responsible for desmin 
phosphorylation. GSK3-β inhibition in mice prevented desmin phosphorylation and 
depolymerization and blocked atrophy upon fasting or denervation. Desmin was 
phosphorylated by GSK3-β 3 d after denervation, but depolymerized only 4 d later 
when cytosolic Ca2+ levels rose. Mass spectrometry analysis identified GSK3-β 
and the Ca2+-specific protease, calpain-1, bound to desmin and catalyzing its 
disassembly. Consistently, calpain-1 down-regulation prevented loss of 
phosphorylated desmin and blocked atrophy. Thus, phosphorylation of desmin 
filaments by GSK3-β is a key molecular event required for calpain-1-mediated 
depolymerization, and the subsequent myofibril destruction. Consequently, GSK3-β 
represents a novel drug target to prevent myofibril breakdown and atrophy.
