The mechanisms that enable immune evasion at metastatic sites are poorly 
understood. We show that the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) drives 
colonization of the bones and visceral organs in double-negative prostate cancer 
(DNPC). In vivo genetic screening identifies CCL2 as the top prometastatic gene 
induced by PRC1. CCL2 governs self-renewal and induces the recruitment of 
M2-like tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells, thus coordinating 
metastasis initiation with immune suppression and neoangiogenesis. A catalytic 
inhibitor of PRC1 cooperates with immune checkpoint therapy to reverse these 
processes and suppress metastasis in genetically engineered mouse 
transplantation models of DNPC. These results reveal that PRC1 coordinates 
stemness with immune evasion and neoangiogenesis and point to the potential 
clinical utility of targeting PRC1 in DNPC.
