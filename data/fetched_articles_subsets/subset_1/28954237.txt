Quiescence is a non-proliferative cellular state that is critical to tissue 
repair and regeneration. Although often described as the G0 phase, quiescence is 
not a single homogeneous state. As cells remain quiescent for longer durations, 
they move progressively deeper and display a reduced sensitivity to growth 
signals. Deep quiescent cells, unlike senescent cells, can still re-enter the 
cell cycle under physiological conditions. Mechanisms controlling quiescence 
depth are poorly understood, representing a currently underappreciated layer of 
complexity in growth control. Here, we show that the activation threshold of 
a Retinoblastoma (Rb)-E2F network switch controls quiescence depth. 
Particularly, deeper quiescent cells feature a higher E2F-switching threshold 
and exhibit a delayed traverse through the restriction point (R-point). We 
further show that different components of the Rb-E2F network can be 
experimentally perturbed, following computer model predictions, to coarse- or 
fine-tune the E2F-switching threshold and drive cells into varying quiescence 
depths.
