Synthesis of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) is crucial for bacterial cell division. 
FtsW, an indispensable component of the cell division machinery in all walled 
bacterial species, was recently identified in vitro as a peptidoglycan 
glycosyltransferase (PGTase). Despite its importance, the septal PGTase activity 
of FtsW has not been demonstrated in vivo. How its activity is spatiotemporally 
regulated in vivo has also remained elusive. Here, we confirmed FtsW as an 
essential septum-specific PGTase in vivo using an N-acetylmuramic acid analogue 
incorporation assay. Next, using single-molecule tracking coupled with genetic 
manipulations, we identified two populations of processively moving FtsW 
molecules: a fast-moving population correlated with the treadmilling dynamics of 
the essential cytoskeletal FtsZ protein and a slow-moving population dependent 
on active sPG synthesis. We further identified that FtsN, a potential sPG 
synthesis activator, plays an important role in promoting the slow-moving 
population. Our results suggest a two-track model, in which inactive sPG 
synthases follow the 'Z-track' to be distributed along the septum and FtsN 
promotes their release from the Z-track to become active in sPG synthesis on the 
slow 'sPG-track'. This model provides a mechanistic framework for the 
spatiotemporal coordination of sPG synthesis in bacterial cell division.
