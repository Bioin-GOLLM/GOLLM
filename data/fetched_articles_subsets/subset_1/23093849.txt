BACKGROUND: The B2-bradykinin receptor (BDKRB2) has been reported to associate 
with onset and development of Osteoarthritis (OA); however, the role of BDKRB2 
genetic polymorphisms in OA remains unknown.
METHOD: A total of 245 patients with primary knee OA and 264 healthy volunteer 
were recruited. BDKRB2 gene polymorphisms, -58T/C and +9/-9 bp polymorphisms, 
were genotyped.
RESULTS: The genotype distributions and allele frequencies of +9/-9 bp 
polymorphisms significantly differed between OA and control subjects. Logistic 
regression analysis showed carriers with -9/-9 genotype had a significantly 
increased risk for knee OA compared with the +9/+9 genotype (adjusted OR = 
2.356, P < 0.001). The OR for -9 allele carriage was significantly higher than 
+9 allele carriage (adjusted OR = 1.52, P < 0.001). The +9/-9 bp polymorphisms 
also determined the OA radiographic severity. The presence of -9 bp was 
associated with severer OA. The -58T/C polymorphisms did not affect OA risk and 
severity.
CONCLUSION: The +9/-9 bp polymorphisms of BDKRB2 gene may be used as a genetic 
marker for the susceptibility and severity of OA.
