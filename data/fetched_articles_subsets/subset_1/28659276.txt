β-Hemoglobinopathies are among the most common single-locus inherited diseases. 
In this condition, high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels have been found to be 
beneficial, and boosting HbF expression is seen as an attractive therapy. 
Naturally occurring mutations in the fetal globin promoter can result in high 
HbF persisting into adulthood in a benign condition known as hereditary 
persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Individuals with one form of HPFH, 
British HPFH, carry a T to C substitution at position -198 of the fetal globin 
gene promoter. These individuals exhibit HbF levels of up to 20%, enough to 
ameliorate the symptoms of β-hemoglobinopathies. Here, we use clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-mediated genome editing to 
introduce the -198 substitution into human erythroid HUDEP-2 cells and show that 
this mutation is sufficient to substantially elevate expression of HbF. We also 
examined the molecular mechanism underlying the increase in fetal globin 
expression. Through a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we 
demonstrate that the mutation creates a de novo binding site for the important 
erythroid gene activator Krüppel-like factor 1 (KLF1/erythroid KLF). Our results 
indicate that introducing this single naturally occurring mutation leads to 
significantly boosted HbF levels.
