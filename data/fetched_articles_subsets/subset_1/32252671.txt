BACKGROUND: The effects of dietary factors on prognosis of esophageal cancer 
remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the 
association between dietary intake and the risk of mortality among patients with 
esophageal cancer.
METHODS: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, OVID, ProQuest, CNKI 
and Wanfang) were searched for studies published up to Oct. 2019 that examined 
the association between dietary intake and all-cause mortality, esophageal 
cancer-specific mortality and esophageal cancer recurrence. The pooled hazard 
ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived by comparing the 
highest with the lowest categories of each dietary item and by using random 
effect models.
RESULTS: A total of 15 cohort studies were included in this study and all 
reported pre-diagnosis dietary exposure; two focused on dietary folate, 12 on 
alcohol consumption and three on other dietary components (sugary beverages, 
phytochemicals and preserved vegetables). When comparing the highest with the 
lowest categories, dietary folate intake was associated with a reduced risk of 
esophageal cancer-specific mortality in patients with esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25-0.69), with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, 
P = 0.788). When comparing the highest with the lowest categories of alcohol 
consumption, alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of 
all-cause mortality in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR: 
1.29, 95% CI: 1.07-1.55; heterogeneity: I2 = 53%, P = 0.030), but this increased 
risk was not significant in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR = 1.05, 
95% CI: 0.84-1.32).
CONCLUSIONS: This review with pre-diagnostic dietary exposure showed that 
dietary folate intake was associated with a reduced risk of mortality of 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, whereas alcohol consumption was associated 
with an increased risk. More studies are needed to investigate effect of dietary 
factors, especially post-diagnosis dietary consumption, on esophageal cancer 
prognosis.
