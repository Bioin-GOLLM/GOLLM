OBJECTIVE: Anti-PD-1 has dramatically improved the survival of patients with 
advanced melanoma. However, there is a lack of data on maintenance of the 
response after treatment discontinuation. We aimed to evaluate the 
progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with metastatic melanoma after 
anti-PD-1 interruption for objective response (OR) or limiting toxicity during 
clinical trials.
METHODS: All patients with advanced melanoma who stopped single-agent anti-PD-1 
antibodies for objective response or toxicity were included between April 2014 
and January 2019 in our institution (data cut-off, September 10th, 2019). 
Clinical and biological factors associated with relapse were studied.
RESULTS: The median follow-up after introduction of treatment was 36.5 months 
[4.6-62.4], and the median follow-up after discontinuation of treatment was 15.7 
months (2.5-45.1). Out of 65 patients, 28 patients stopped immunotherapy for 
limiting adverse effects (AEs) (43.1%), 25 for complete response (CR) (38.4%), 
and 12 for partial response (PR) or long-term stable disease (SD) (18.5%). 
Twelve patients relapsed (18.5%) after a median time of 9 months [1.9-40.9 
months]. Seven relapsed after discontinuation for AEs, 3 after discontinuation 
for CR, and 2 after discontinuation for PR/SD. The median PFS after therapy 
discontinuation was not reached. No statistical association was found between 
recurrence and age, sex, increased LDH, BRAF status, presence of brain 
metastases, previous treatments, radiotherapy, or time on anti-PD-1 treatment.
CONCLUSION: This cohort shows a global recurrence rate of 18.5% and confirms a 
long-lasting response after anti-PD-1 cessation regardless of the cause of 
discontinuation.
