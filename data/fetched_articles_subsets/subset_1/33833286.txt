Caveolin-1 (CAV1), the caveolae coat protein, also associates with non-caveolar 
scaffold domains. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) network 
analysis distinguishes caveolae and three scaffold domains, hemispherical S2 
scaffolds and smaller S1B and S1A scaffolds. The caveolin scaffolding domain 
(CSD) is a highly conserved hydrophobic region that mediates interaction of CAV1 
with multiple effector molecules. F92A/V94A mutation disrupts CSD function, 
however the structural impact of CSD mutation on caveolae or scaffolds remains 
unknown. Here, SMLM network analysis quantitatively shows that expression of the 
CAV1 CSD F92A/V94A mutant in CRISPR/Cas CAV1 knockout MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 
cells reduces the size and volume and enhances the elongation of caveolae and 
scaffold domains, with more pronounced effects on S2 and S1B scaffolds. Convex 
hull analysis of the outer surface of the CAV1 point clouds confirms the size 
reduction of CSD mutant CAV1 blobs and shows that CSD mutation reduces volume 
variation amongst S2 and S1B CAV1 blobs at increasing shrink values, that may 
reflect retraction of the CAV1 N-terminus towards the membrane, potentially 
preventing accessibility of the CSD. Detection of point mutation-induced changes 
to CAV1 domains highlights the utility of SMLM network analysis for mesoscale 
structural analysis of oligomers in their native environment.
