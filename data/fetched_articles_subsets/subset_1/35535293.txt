Short stature is a main problem in Noonan syndrome (NS). Recombinant human 
growth hormone (GH) has been used to safely improve the growth rate in NS 
patients with short stature. However, there is little information about GH 
therapy for NS associated with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. We 
present the case of a seven-year-old NS patient with severe hypertrophic 
obstructive cardiomyopathy. The patient received GH therapy for six months, at 
which time progressive left ventricular outflow tract stenosis was apparent.
