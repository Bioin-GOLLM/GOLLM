BACKGROUND: Hybrid fixation techniques including the both modified cortical bone 
trajectory (MCBT) and traditional trajectory (TT) at the L4 and L5 lumbar 
segment are firstly proposed by our team. Therefore, the purpose of this study 
is to evaluate and provide specific biomechanical data of the hybrid fixation 
techniques including the MCBT and TT.
METHODS: Four human cadaveric specimens were from the anatomy laboratory of 
Xinjiang Medical University. Four finite-element (FE) models of the L4-L5 lumbar 
spine were generated. For each of them, four implanted models with the following 
fixations were established: TT-TT (TT screw at the cranial and caudal level), 
MCBT-MCBT (MCBT screw at the cranial and caudal level), hybrid MCBT-TT (MCBT 
screw at the cranial level and TT screw at the caudal level), and TT-MCBT (TT 
screw at the cranial level and MCBT screw at the caudal level). A 400-N 
compressive load with 7.5 N/m moments was applied to simulate flexion, 
extension, lateral bending, and rotation, respectively. The range of motion 
(ROM) of the L4-L5 segment and the posterior fixation, the von Mises stress of 
the intervertebral disc, and the posterior fixation were compared.
RESULTS: Compared to the TT-TT group, the MCBT-TT showed a significant lower ROM 
of the L4-L5 segment (p ≤ 0.009), lower ROM of the posterior fixation 
(p < 0.001), lower intervertebral disc stress (p < 0.001), and lower posterior 
fixation stress (p ≤ 0.041). TT-MCBT groups showed a significant lower ROM of 
the L4-L5 segment (p ≤ 0.012), lower ROM of the posterior fixation (p < 0.001), 
lower intervertebral disc stress (p < 0.001), and lower posterior fixation 
stress (p ≤ 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of the hybrid MCBT-TT and TT-MCBT 
techniques at the L4-L5 segment are superior to that of stability MCBT-MCBT and 
TT-TT techniques, and feasibility needs further cadaveric study to verify.
