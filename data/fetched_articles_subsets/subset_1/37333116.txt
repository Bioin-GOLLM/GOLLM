BACKGROUND: The X chromosome is often omitted in disease association studies 
despite containing thousands of genes which may provide insight into well-known 
sex differences in the risk of Alzheimer's Disease.
OBJECTIVE: To model the expression of X chromosome genes and evaluate their 
impact on Alzheimer's Disease risk in a sex-stratified manner.
METHODS: Using elastic net, we evaluated multiple modeling strategies in a set 
of 175 whole blood samples and 126 brain cortex samples, with whole genome 
sequencing and RNA-seq data. SNPs (MAF>0.05) within the cis-regulatory window 
were used to train tissue-specific models of each gene. We apply the best models 
in both tissues to sex-stratified summary statistics from a meta-analysis of 
Alzheimer's disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) studies to identify AD-related 
genes on the X chromosome.
RESULTS: Across different model parameters, sample sex, and tissue types, we 
modeled the expression of 217 genes (95 genes in blood and 135 genes in brain 
cortex). The average model R2 was 0.12 (range from 0.03 to 0.34). We also 
compared sex-stratified and sex-combined models on the X chromosome. We further 
investigated genes that escaped X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to determine if 
their genetic regulation patterns were distinct. We found ten genes associated 
with AD at p 0.05, with only ARMCX6 in female brain cortex (p = 0.008) nearing 
the significance threshold after adjusting for multiple testing (Î± = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We optimized the expression prediction of X chromosome genes, 
applied these models to sex-stratified AD GWAS summary statistics, and 
identified one putative AD risk gene, ARMCX6.
