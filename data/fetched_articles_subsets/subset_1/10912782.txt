Although ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells are the cell type responsible 
for malignant ovarian carcinoma, relatively little is known about either the 
extracellular stimuli or the intracellular signaling mechanisms responsible for 
regulating proliferation in these cells. We have demonstrated that OSE cells 
proliferate in response to elevation of extracellular calcium and that OSE cells 
express functional calcium-sensing receptors (CaR). Here we show that agonists 
of the CaR increase the kinase activity of Src and ERKs (extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases) in rat OSE cells and promote association between 
tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc and p120rasGAP. Expression of an interfering mutant 
CaR inhibited the proliferative response to elevated extracellular calcium, as 
well as CaR agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK activation. 
Transfection with dominant negative mutants of Ras, Raf, and MKK1 also inhibited 
the increase in ERK activity in response to calcium, as did treatment with 
herbimycin, a selective inhibitor for Src family kinases. These results indicate 
that the ability of OSE cells to proliferate in response to increases in 
extracellular calcium involves cross-talk between the G-protein-coupled CaR and 
the activation of a tyrosine kinase-dependent Ras-Raf-ERK signaling pathway.
