The title compound, [PdCl(2){P(C(6)H(11))(2)(C(6)H(5))}(2)], forms a monomeric 
complex with a trans-square-planar geometry. The Pd-P bond lengths are 
2.3343 (5) Å, as the Pd atom lies on an inversion centre, while the Pd-Cl bond 
lengths are 2.3017 (4) Å. The observed structure was found to be closely related 
to [PdCl(2){P(C(6)H(11))(3)}(2)] [Grushin et al. (1994 ▶). Inorg. Chem.33, 
4804-4806], [PdBr(2){P(C(6)H(11))(3)}(2)] [Clarke et al. (2003 ▶). Dalton Trans. 
pp. 4393-4394] and [PdCl(2)P(C(6)H(11))(2)(C(7)H(7))}(2)] [Vuoti et al. (2008 
▶). Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. pp. 397-407] (C(6)H(11) is cyclo-hexyl and C(7)H(7) is 
o-tol-yl). One of the cyclo-hexyl rings is disordered with the phenyl ring in a 
0.587 (9):413 (9) ratio. Five long-range C-H⋯Cl inter-actions were observed 
within the structure.
