Classic galactosemia results from mutations in the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl 
transferase gene and causes infants to present with jaundice after initiation of 
lactose containing formulas. Jaundice associated with galactosemia is often 
thought to have a prominent direct fraction. We report an infant with 
galactosemia who presented with severe jaundice from indirect hyperbilirubinemia 
and met criteria for an exchange transfusion within 48 h after milk ingestion.
