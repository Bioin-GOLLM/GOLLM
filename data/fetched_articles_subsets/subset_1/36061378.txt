OBJECTIVE: To analyze the genotypic characteristics of patients with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated dystrophic scoliosis and to summarize 
the outcomes of the surgical treatment of these patients.
METHODS: Exome sequencing (ES) combined with multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplification (MLPA) was used for genotypic identification. All patients 
underwent surgical treatments for spinal deformities, and the outcomes of the 
surgery was summarized by analyzing the clinical and imaging parameters before 
and after the surgery.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients (six males and eight females) were clinically 
diagnosed as NF1 associated dystrophic scoliosis with common symptoms including 
café-au-lait spots, paravertebral tumors, and dystrophic scoliosis. NF1 
mutations were detected in 12 (85.7%) patients, including four nonsense 
mutations, three splicing mutations, three frameshift mutations, and two exon 
deletions. The first surgical procedure included growing-rod surgery in 10 
patients and posterior spinal fusion in four patients. The follow-up duration 
was 2.3 years (1.0-10.3 years), and the Cobb angle of the main curve improved 
from 61.5° (30°-125°) pre-operatively to 14.5° (0°-42°) at the last follow-up, 
with an average correction rate of 74.0% (44-100%). Instrumentation-related 
complications occurred in four patients during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dystrophic scoliosis who met the clinical 
diagnostic criteria for NF1, the mutation detection rate of ES combined with 
MLPA was 85.7%. There was no mutation hotspot in NF1 gene, molecular diagnosis 
could offer information about genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and 
eugenics. Surgical treatment according to patient's age and severity could 
effectively correct the spinal deformities.
