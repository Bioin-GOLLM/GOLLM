Alpha1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT) is the most abundant circulating inhibitor of 
serine proteases and therefore is essential to normal protease-anti-protease 
homeostasis. Inheritance of two parental alpha1-AT deficiency alleles is 
associated with a substantially increased risk for development of emphysema and 
liver disease. In very rare circumstances individuals may inherit alpha1-AT null 
alleles. Null alpha1-AT alleles are characterized by the total absence of serum 
alpha1-AT. These alleles represent the extreme end in a continuum of alleles 
associated with alpha1-AT deficiency. The molecular mechanisms responsible for 
absence of serum alpha1-AT include splicing abnormalities, deletion of alpha1-AT 
coding exons and premature stop codons. While these alleles comprise only a 
small proportion of alpha1-AT alleles associated with profound alpha1-AT 
deficiency, studies of their molecular mechanisms provide valuable insights into 
the structure, gene expression and intracellular transport of alpha1-AT.
