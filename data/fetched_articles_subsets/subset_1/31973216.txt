Retinoblastoma is the most common pediatric intraocular malignant tumor. 
Unfortunately, low cure rates and low life expectancy are observed in low-income 
countries. Thus, alternative therapies are needed for patients who do not 
respond to current treatments or those with advanced cases of the disease. Ether 
à-go-go-1 (Eag1) is a voltage-gated potassium channel involved in cancer. Eag1 
expression is upregulated by the human papilloma virus (HPV) oncogene E7, 
suggesting that retinoblastoma protein (pRb) may regulate Eag1. Astemizole is an 
antihistamine that is suggested to be repurposed for cancer treatment; it 
targets proteins implicated in cancer, including histamine receptors, ATP 
binding cassette transporters, and Eag channels. Here, we investigated Eag1 
regulation using pRb and Eag1 expression in human retinoblastoma. The effect of 
astemizole on the cell proliferation of primary human retinoblastoma cultures 
was also studied. HeLa cervical cancer cells (HPV-positive and expressing Eag1) 
were transfected with RB1. Eag1 mRNA expression was studied using qPCR, and 
protein expression was assessed using western blotting and immunochemistry. Cell 
proliferation was evaluated with an MTT 
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. RB1 
transfection down-regulated Eag1 mRNA and protein expression. The human 
retinoblastoma samples displayed heterogeneous Eag1 mRNA and protein expression. 
Astemizole decreased cell proliferation in primary retinoblastoma cultures. Our 
results suggest that Eag1 mRNA and protein expression was regulated by pRb in 
vitro, and that human retinoblastoma tissues had heterogeneous Eag1 mRNA and 
protein expression. Furthermore, our results propose that the multitarget drug 
astemizole may have clinical relevance in patients with retinoblastoma, for 
instance, in those who do not respond to current treatments.
