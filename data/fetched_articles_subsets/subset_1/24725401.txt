Autophagy is directed by numerous distinct autophagy-related (Atg) proteins. 
These transmit starvation-induced signals to lipids and regulatory proteins and 
assemble a double-membrane autophagosome sequestering bulk cytoplasm and/or 
selected cargos destined for degradation upon autophagosome fusion with a 
vacuole or lysosome. This Review discusses the structural mechanisms by which 
Atg proteins sense membrane curvature, mediate a PI(3)P-signaling cascade, and 
utilize autophagy-specific ubiquitin-like protein cascades to tether proteins to 
autophagosomal membranes. Recent elucidation of molecular interactions enabling 
vesicle nucleation, elongation, and cargo recruitment provides insights into how 
dynamic protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions may dictate size, 
shape, and contents of autophagosomes.
