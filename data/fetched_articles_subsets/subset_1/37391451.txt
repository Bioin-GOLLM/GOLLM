The failure of melanoma immunotherapy can be mediated by immunosuppression in 
the tumor microenvironment (TME), and insufficient activation of effector T 
cells against the tumor. Here, we show that inhibition of galectin-3 (gal-3) 
enhances the infiltration of T cells in TME and improves the sensitivity of 
anti-PD-L1 therapy. We identify that RNF8 downregulated the expression of gal-3 
by K48-polyubiquitination and promoted gal-3 degradation via the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system. RNF8 deficiency in the host but sufficiency in 
implanted melanoma results in immune exclusion and tumor progression due to the 
upregulation of gal-3. Upregulation of gal-3 decreased the immune cell 
infiltration by restricting IL-12 and IFN-γ. Inhibition of gal-3 reverses 
immunosuppression and induces immune cell infiltration in the tumor 
microenvironment. Moreover, gal-3 inhibitor treatment can increase the 
sensitivity of PD-L1 inhibitors via increasing immune cell infiltration and 
enhancing immune response in tumors. This study reveals a previously 
unrecognized immunoregulation function of RNF8 and provides a promising strategy 
for the therapy of "cold" tumors. Tremendous effects of melanoma treatment can 
be achieved by facilitating immune cell infiltration combined with anti-PD-L1 
treatment.
