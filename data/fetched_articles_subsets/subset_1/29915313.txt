Clinical studies have found that moderate intake of retinol or oleic acid can 
enlarge the lipid droplets of hepatic stellate cells and suppress their 
activation. However, the link between lipid droplets and cell activation is 
unknown. This study compared the dynamics of lipid droplet-associated protein 
expression between activated and reverted stellate cells. Reversion of the 
activated human stellate cell line LX-2 and inhibition of primary mouse stellate 
cell activation were induced by retinol or oleic acid, which resulted in larger 
lipid droplets and the downregulation of cell activation markers. Quantitative 
proteomics and immunoblotting were performed to compare lipid-droplet protein 
profiles between activated and reverted LX-2 cells. Compared to expression in 
activated cells, 50 lipid-droplet proteins were upregulated, whereas 28 were 
downregulated upon reversion. ATG2A was significantly enriched in lipid droplets 
of retinol/oleic acid-treated LX-2 cells and quiescent primary stellate cells. 
Reduced expression of Î±-SMA, increased expression of perilipin-3, enlarged lipid 
droplets, and suppression of autophagic flux were observed in ATG2A-deficient 
LX2 cells. Lipid-droplet protein profile changes during the reversion of 
activated stellate cells might provide new insights into the molecular 
mechanisms linking lipid droplets to liver fibrosis. ATG2A could represent a 
potential new drug target for hepatic fibrosis.
