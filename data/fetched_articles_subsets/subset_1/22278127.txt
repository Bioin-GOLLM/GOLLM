Neuroferritinopathy is an autosomal dominant progressive movement disorder which 
occurs due to mutations in the ferritin light chain gene (FTL1). It presents in 
mid-adult life and is the only autosomal dominant disease in a group of 
conditions termed neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). We 
performed brain MRI scans on 12 asymptomatic descendants of known mutation 
carriers. All three harbouring the pathogenic c.460InsA mutation showed iron 
deposition; these findings show pathological iron accumulation begins in early 
childhood which is of major importance in understanding and developing treatment 
for NBIA.
