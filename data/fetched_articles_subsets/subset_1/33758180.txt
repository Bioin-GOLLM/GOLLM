A wide repertoire of genetic switches has accelerated prokaryotic synthetic 
biology, while eukaryotic synthetic biology has lagged in the model organism 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Eukaryotic genetic switches are larger and more 
complex than prokaryotic ones, complicating the rational design and evolution of 
them. Here, we present a robust workflow for the creation and evolution of yeast 
genetic switches. The selector system was designed so that both ON- and 
OFF-state selection of genetic switches is completed solely by liquid handling, 
and it enabled parallel screen/selection of different motifs with different 
selection conditions. Because selection threshold of both ON- and OFF-state 
selection can be flexibly tuned, the desired selection conditions can be rapidly 
pinned down for individual directed evolution experiments without a prior 
knowledge either on the library population. The system's utility was 
demonstrated using 20 independent directed evolution experiments, yielding 
genetic switches with elevated inducer sensitivities, inverted switching 
behaviours, sensory functions, and improved signal-to-noise ratio (>100-fold 
induction). The resulting yeast genetic switches were readily integrated, in a 
plug-and-play manner, into an AND-gated carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.
