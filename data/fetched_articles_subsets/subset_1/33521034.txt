Faecal proteomics targeting biomarkers of immunity and inflammation have 
demonstrated clinical application for the identification of changes in 
gastrointestinal function. However, there are limited comprehensive analyses of 
the host faecal proteome and how it may be influenced by dietary factors. To 
examine this, the Homo sapiens post-diet proteome of older males was analysed at 
the completion of a 10-week dietary intervention, either meeting the minimum 
dietary protein recommendations (RDA; n = 9) or twice the recommended dietary 
allowance (2RDA, n = 10). The host faecal proteome differed markedly between 
individuals, with only a small subset of proteins present in ≥ 60% of subjects 
(14 and 44 proteins, RDA and 2RDA, respectively, with only 7 common to both 
groups). No differences were observed between the diet groups on the profiles of 
host faecal proteins. Faecal proteins were detected from a wide range of protein 
classes, with high inter-individual variation and absence of obvious impact in 
response to diets with markedly different protein intake. This suggests that 
well-matched whole food diets with two-fold variation in protein intake 
maintained for 10 weeks have minimal impact on human faecal host proteins.
