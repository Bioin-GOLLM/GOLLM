BACKGROUND: Myocardial insulin resistance is a hallmark of diabetic cardiac 
injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent 
studies demonstrate that the diabetic heart is resistant to other 
cardioprotective interventions, including adiponectin and preconditioning. The 
"universal" resistance to multiple therapeutic interventions suggests impairment 
of the requisite molecule(s) involved in broad prosurvival signaling cascades. 
Cav (Caveolin) is a scaffolding protein coordinating transmembrane signaling 
transduction. However, the role of Cav3 in diabetic impairment of cardiac 
protective signaling and diabetic ischemic heart failure is unknown.
METHODS: Wild-type and gene-manipulated mice were fed a normal diet or high-fat 
diet for 2 to 12 weeks and subjected to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. 
Insulin cardioprotection was determined.
RESULTS: Compared with the normal diet group, the cardioprotective effect of 
insulin was significantly blunted as early as 4 weeks of high-fat diet feeding 
(prediabetes), a time point where expression levels of insulin-signaling 
molecules remained unchanged. However, Cav3/insulin receptor-β complex formation 
was significantly reduced. Among multiple posttranslational modifications 
altering protein/protein interaction, Cav3 (not insulin receptor-β) tyrosine 
nitration is prominent in the prediabetic heart. Treatment of cardiomyocytes 
with 5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride reduced the 
signalsome complex and blocked insulin transmembrane signaling. Mass 
spectrometry identified Tyr73 as the Cav3 nitration site. Phenylalanine 
substitution of Tyr73 (Cav3Y73F) abolished 
5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride-induced Cav3 nitration, 
restored Cav3/insulin receptor-β complex, and rescued insulin transmembrane 
signaling. It is most important that adeno-associated virus 9-mediated 
cardiomyocyte-specific Cav3Y73F reexpression blocked high-fat diet-induced Cav3 
nitration, preserved Cav3 signalsome integrity, restored transmembrane 
signaling, and rescued insulin-protective action against ischemic heart failure. 
Last, diabetic nitrative modification of Cav3 at Tyr73 also reduced Cav3/AdipoR1 
complex formation and blocked adiponectin cardioprotective signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Nitration of Cav3 at Tyr73 and resultant signal complex 
dissociation results in cardiac insulin/adiponectin resistance in the 
prediabetic heart, contributing to ischemic heart failure progression. Early 
interventions preserving Cav3-centered signalsome integrity is an effective 
novel strategy against diabetic exacerbation of ischemic heart failure.
