Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common malignant tumor in the world, 
shows multiple complex and pathologies based on the impaired structure and 
function of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Goblet cells secrete mucins, which 
are involved in the formation of the intestinal mucosal barrier and not only 
lubricate and protect the intestinal mucosa but also participate in the 
processes of cell adhesion, intercellular signal transduction, and immune 
regulation. It is accepted that the disordered expression and dysfunction of 
mucins are associated with the occurrence and development of CRC. This article 
focuses on the secretory mucins encoded by a gene cluster located on chromosome 
11p15.5 and systematically reviews their composition, regulation, function, and 
role in CRC, to deepen the understanding of the pathogeneses of CRC and to 
provide a new basis and ideas for the treatment of CRC.
