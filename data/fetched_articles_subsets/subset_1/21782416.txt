Remarkable progress has been made in the field of G protein-coupled receptor 
(GPCR) structural biology during the past four years. Several obstacles to 
generating diffraction quality crystals of GPCRs have been overcome by combining 
innovative methods ranging from protein engineering to lipid-based screens and 
microdiffraction technology. The initial GPCR structures represent energetically 
stable inactive-state conformations. However, GPCRs signal through different G 
protein isoforms or G protein-independent effectors upon ligand binding 
suggesting the existence of multiple ligand-specific active states. These 
active-state conformations are unstable in the absence of specific cytosolic 
signaling partners representing new challenges for structural biology. Camelid 
single chain antibody fragments (nanobodies) show promise for stabilizing active 
GPCR conformations and as chaperones for crystallogenesis.
