BACKGROUND: The study aimed to validate previously discovered plasma biomarkers 
associated with AD, using a design based on imaging measures as surrogate for 
disease severity and assess their prognostic value in predicting conversion to 
dementia.
METHODS: Three multicenter cohorts of cognitively healthy elderly, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants with standardized clinical 
assessments and structural neuroimaging measures were used. Twenty-six candidate 
proteins were quantified in 1148 subjects using multiplex (xMAP) assays.
RESULTS: Sixteen proteins correlated with disease severity and cognitive 
decline. Strongest associations were in the MCI group with a panel of 10 
proteins predicting progression to AD (accuracy 87%, sensitivity 85%, and 
specificity 88%).
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified 10 plasma proteins strongly associated with 
disease severity and disease progression. Such markers may be useful for patient 
selection for clinical trials and assessment of patients with predisease 
subjective memory complaints.
