Vulnerability to depression is increased across the menopause transition and in 
the early years after the final menstrual period. Clinicians should 
systematically screen women in this age group; if depressive symptoms or 
disorder are present, treatment of depression should be initiated. Potential 
treatments include antidepressants for moderate to severe symptoms, 
psychotherapy to target psychological and interpersonal factors, and hormone 
therapy for women with first-onset major depressive disorder or elevated 
depressive symptoms and at low risk for adverse effects. Behavioral 
interventions can improve physical activity and sleep patterns.
