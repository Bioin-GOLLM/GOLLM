When small proteins such as cytokines bind to their associated receptors on the 
plasma membrane, they can activate multiple internal signaling cascades allowing 
information from one cell to affect another. Frequently the signaling cascade 
leads to a change in gene expression that can affect cell functions such as 
proliferation, differentiation and homeostasis. The Janus kinase-signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and the tumor necrosis 
factor receptor (TNFR) are the pivotal mechanisms employed for such 
communication. When deregulated, the JAK-STAT and the TNF receptor signaling 
pathways can induce chronic inflammatory phenotypes by promoting more cytokine 
production. Furthermore, these signaling pathways can promote replication, 
survival and metastasis of cancer cells. This review will summarize the 
essentials of the JAK/STAT and TNF signaling pathways and their regulation and 
the molecular mechanisms that lead to the dysregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway. 
The consequences of dysregulation, as ascertained from founding work in 
haematopoietic malignancies to more recent research in solid 
oral-gastrointestinal cancers, will also be discussed. Finally, this review will 
highlight the development and future of therapeutic applications which modulate 
the JAK-STAT or the TNF signaling pathways in cancers.
