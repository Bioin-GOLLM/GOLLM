Human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (h15-LOX-1 or h12/15-LOX) reacts with polyunsaturated 
fatty acids and produces bioactive lipid derivatives that are implicated in many 
important human diseases. One such disease is stroke, which is the fifth leading 
cause of death and the first leading cause of disability in America. The 
discovery of h15-LOX-1 inhibitors could potentially lead to novel therapeutics 
in the treatment of stroke, however, little is known about the inhibitor/active 
site interaction. This study utilizes site-directed mutagenesis, guided in part 
by molecular modeling, to gain a better structural understanding of inhibitor 
interactions within the active site. We have generated eight mutants (R402L, 
R404L, F414I, F414W, E356Q, Q547L, L407A, I417A) of h15-LOX-1 to determine 
whether these active site residues interact with two h15-LOX-1 inhibitors, ML351 
and an ML094 derivative, compound 18. IC50 values and steady-state inhibition 
kinetics were determined for the eight mutants, with four of the mutants 
affecting inhibitor potency relative to wild type h15-LOX-1 (F414I, F414W, E356Q 
and L407A). The data indicate that ML351 and compound 18, bind in a similar 
manner in the active site to an aromatic pocket close to F414 but have subtle 
differences in their specific binding modes. This information establishes the 
binding mode for ML094 and ML351 and will be leveraged to develop 
next-generation inhibitors.
