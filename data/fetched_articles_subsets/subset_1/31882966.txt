Physical activity is an important contributor to muscle adaptation and metabolic 
health. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) is established as cellular and 
nutritional stress-induced cytokine but its physiological role in response to 
active lifestyle or acute exercise is unknown. Here, we investigated the 
metabolic phenotype and circulating GDF15 levels in lean and obese male C57Bl/6J 
mice with long-term voluntary wheel running (VWR) intervention. Additionally, 
treadmill running capacity and exercise-induced muscle gene expression was 
examined in GDF15-ablated mice. Active lifestyle mimic via VWR improved 
treadmill running performance and, in obese mice, also metabolic phenotype. The 
post-exercise induction of skeletal muscle transcriptional stress markers was 
reduced by VWR. Skeletal muscle GDF15 gene expression was very low and only 
transiently increased post-exercise in sedentary but not in active mice. Plasma 
GDF15 levels were only marginally affected by chronic or acute exercise. In 
obese mice, VWR reduced GDF15 gene expression in different tissues but did not 
reverse elevated plasma GDF15. Genetic ablation of GDF15 had no effect on 
exercise performance but augmented the post exercise expression of 
transcriptional exercise stress markers (Atf3, Atf6, and Xbp1s) in skeletal 
muscle. We conclude that skeletal muscle does not contribute to circulating 
GDF15 in mice, but muscle GDF15 might play a protective role in the exercise 
stress response.
