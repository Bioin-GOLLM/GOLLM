Immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (HC) class switch recombination (CSR) is a late 
B cell process that involves intrachromosomal DNA rearrangement. Ku70 and Ku80 
form a DNA end-binding complex required for DNA double strand break repair and 
V(D)J recombination. Ku70(-/-) (K70T) mice, like recombination activating gene 
(RAG)-1- or RAG-2-deficient (R1T or R2T) mice, have impaired B and T cell 
development at an early progenitor stage, which is thought to result at least in 
part from defective V(D)J recombination (Gu, Y., K.J. Seidl, G.A. Rathbun, C. 
Zhu, J.P. Manis, N. van der Stoep, L. Davidson, H.L. Cheng, J.M. Sekiguchi, K. 
Frank, et al. 1997. Immunity. 7:653-665; Ouyang, H., A. Nussenzweig, A. 
Kurimasa, V.C. Soares, X. Li, C. Cordon-Cardo, W. Li, N. Cheong, M. Nussenzweig, 
G. Iliakis, et al. 1997. J. Exp. Med. 186:921-929). Therefore, to examine the 
potential role of Ku70 in CSR, we generated K70T mice that carry a germline Ig 
HC locus in which the JH region was replaced with a functionally rearranged 
VH(D)JH and Ig lambda light chain transgene (referred to as K70T/HL mice). 
Previously, we have shown that B cells from R1T or R2T mice carrying these 
rearranged Ig genes (R1T/HL or R2T/HL mice) can undergo CSR to IgG isotypes 
(Lansford, R., J. Manis, E. Sonoda, K. Rajewsky, and F. Alt. 1998. Int. Immunol. 
10:325-332). K70T/HL mice had significant numbers of peripheral surface IgM+ B 
cells, which generated serum IgM levels similar to those of R2T/HL mice. 
However, in contrast to R2T/HL mice, K70T/HL mice had no detectable serum IgG 
isotypes. In vitro culture of K70T/HL B cells with agents that induce CSR in 
normal or R2T/HL B cells did lead to the induction of germline CH transcripts, 
indicating that initial signaling pathways for CSR were intact in K70T/HL cells. 
However, treatment with such agents did not lead to detectable CSR by K70T/HL B 
cells, and instead, led to cell death within 72 h. We conclude that Ku70 is 
required for the generation of B cells that have undergone Ig HC class 
switching. Potential roles for Ku70 in the CSR process are discussed.
