In an attempt to understand ribosome-induced GTP hydrolysis on eEF2, we 
determined a 12.6-A cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the eEF2-bound 
80S ribosome in the presence of aluminum tetrafluoride and GDP, with aluminum 
tetrafluoride mimicking the gamma-phosphate during hydrolysis. This is the first 
visualization of a structure representing a transition-state complex on the 
ribosome. Tight interactions are observed between the factor's G domain and the 
large ribosomal subunit, as well as between domain IV and an intersubunit 
bridge. In contrast, some of the domains of eEF2 implicated in small subunit 
binding display a large degree of flexibility. Furthermore, we find support for 
a transition-state model conformation of the switch I region in this complex 
where the reoriented switch I region interacts with a conserved rRNA region of 
the 40S subunit formed by loops of the 18S RNA helices 8 and 14. This complex is 
structurally distinct from the eEF2-bound 80S ribosome complexes previously 
reported, and analysis of this map sheds light on the GTPase-coupled 
translocation mechanism.
