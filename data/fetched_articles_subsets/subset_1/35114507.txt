OBJECTIVES: Although asbestos exposure is the most common cause of malignant 
mesothelioma (MM), an aggressive cancer of the pleura or peritoneum, up to 7% of 
patients harbor a genetic predisposition to MM. Pathogenic germline variants in 
the BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene cause a dominantly inherited tumor 
predisposition syndrome, BAP1-TPDS, in which MM is the second most common 
associated cancer. Other frequent cancers in BAP1-TPDS are uveal melanoma (UM), 
cutaneous melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Additionally patients can exhibit 
benign skin lesions, BAP1-inactivated nevi (BIN). Most BINs arise sporadically, 
but patients with BAP1-TPDS may harbor multiple BINs before other tumors or as 
the only indication of the syndrome. Our objective was to establish the 
frequency of pathogenic germline BAP1 variants in Finnish patients with MM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 56 DNA samples archived in the Helsinki Biobank from 
Finnish patients with MM were sequenced for germline BAP1 variations. Formalin 
fixed paraffin embedded nevi from a pathogenic variant carrier were subjected to 
immunohistochemistry and exome sequencing.
RESULTS: Sanger sequencing identified one patient with Finnish founder mutation 
c.1780_1781insT, p.(G549Vfs*49) in BAP1. The carrier was diagnosed with MM over 
fifteen years before the cohorts mean onset age (mean 68, range 27 to 82) 
although the patient had no asbestos exposure or family history of BAP1-TPDS. 
However, the patient had three BINs removed prior to the MM. The c.1780_1781insT 
is now found from five Finnish BAP1-TPDS families with unknown common ancestor.
CONCLUSION: The frequency of pathogenic germline BAP1 variants in Finnish 
patients with MM is 1.8 % (95 % CI, 0.04 to 9.2), comparable to the frequency in 
Finnish patients with UM (1.9 %). The frequency of recurring BINs in patients 
with BAP1-TPDS should be studied further and genetic testing for BAP1 variants 
considered if the patient has ≥ 2 BAP1-TPDS core tumors, including BINs.
