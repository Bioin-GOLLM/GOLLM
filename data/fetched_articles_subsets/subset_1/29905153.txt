Proximal duplication of chromosome 14q, including the FOXG1 gene located on 
14q12, is a rare condition characterised by developmental delay, dysmorphic 
craniofacial features, epilepsy, and severe speech delay. Here, we report a 
patient with West syndrome whose chromosome analysis revealed 14q11.2-21.1 
duplication. The patient was admitted due to infantile epileptic spasms at eight 
months of age, motor developmental delay, and dysmorphic features. Chromosome 
and array-CGH analysis revealed de novo 14q11.2-21.1 duplication, spanning 
∼20 Mb (minimal interval chr14:20203610_40396835). The patient was followed up 
to 13 years of age, and at the last examination was shown to have severe speech 
delay, seizures, and continuous spike-and-wave activity on EEG. The possibility 
of this chromosomal abnormality should be kept in mind in patients with 
developmental delay, epilepsy, and hypsarrtyhmia, in the absence of any 
structural brain lesion or metabolic aetiology.
