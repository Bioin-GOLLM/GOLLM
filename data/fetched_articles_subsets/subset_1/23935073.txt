Human DNA polymerases mu (Polµ) and lambda (Polλ) are X family members involved 
in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA during non-homologous end joining. 
Crucial abilities of these enzymes include bridging of the two 3' 
single-stranded overhangs and trans-polymerization using one 3' end as primer 
and the other as template, to minimize sequence loss. In this context, we have 
studied the importance of a previously uncharacterised sequence ('brooch'), 
located at the N-terminal boundary of the Polß-like polymerase core, and formed 
by Tyr(141), Ala(142), Cys(143), Gln(144) and Arg(145) in Polµ, and by Trp(239), 
Val(240), Cys(241), Ala(242) and Gln(243) in Polλ. The brooch is potentially 
implicated in the maintenance of a closed conformation throughout the catalytic 
cycle, and our studies indicate that it could be a target of Cdk phosphorylation 
in Polµ. The brooch is irrelevant for 1 nt gap filling, but of specific 
importance during end joining: single mutations in the conserved residues 
reduced the formation of two ended synapses and strongly diminished the ability 
of Polµ and polymerase lambda to perform non-homologous end joining reactions in 
vitro.
