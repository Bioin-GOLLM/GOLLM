Although Barrett's metaplasia of the esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor 
lesion to esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs), drivers of cellular transformation 
in BE remain incompletely understood. We use an artificial intelligence-guided 
network approach to study EAC initiation and progression. Key predictions are 
subsequently validated in a human organoid model, in patient-derived biopsy 
specimens of BE, a case-control study of genomics of BE progression, and in a 
cross-sectional study of 113 patients with BE and EACs. Our model classified 
healthy esophagus from BE and BE from EACs in several publicly available gene 
expression data sets (n = 932 samples). The model confirmed that all EACs must 
originate from BE and pinpointed a CXCL8/IL8↔neutrophil immune microenvironment 
as a driver of cellular transformation in EACs and gastroesophageal junction 
adenocarcinomas. This driver is prominent in White individuals but is notably 
absent in African Americans (AAs). Network-derived gene signatures, independent 
signatures of neutrophil processes, CXCL8/IL8 expression, and an absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) are associated with risk of progression. SNPs associated 
with changes in ANC by ethnicity (e.g., benign ethnic neutropenia [BEN]) modify 
that risk. Findings define a racially influenced immunological basis for cell 
transformation and suggest that BEN in AAs may be a deterrent to BE→EAC 
progression.
