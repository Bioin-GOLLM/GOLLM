Aging is characterized by clonal expansion of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem 
cells and by increased risk of myeloid malignancies. Exome sequencing of three 
elderly females with clonal hematopoiesis, demonstrated by X-inactivation 
analysis, identified somatic TET2 mutations. Recurrence testing identified TET2 
mutations in 10 out of 182 individuals with X-inactivation skewing. TET2 
mutations were specific to individuals with clonal hematopoiesis without 
hematological malignancies and were associated with alterations in DNA 
methylation.
