We report a C/T dimorphism in the thrombomodulin (TM) gene that predicts an 
Ala455----Val replacement in the sixth EGF-like domain of TM. This dimorphism 
has allelic frequencies of 82 (Ala) and 18% (Val) in a normal population. In a 
group of protein C deficient patients and in a group of subjects with 
unexplained thrombophilia the allelic frequencies were found to be the same as 
in the normal population. This indicates that with respect to thrombophilia the 
dimorphism is essentially neutral.
