BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare multisystem developmental 
disorder. In this study, we report the genetic causes and clinical 
manifestations in two Chinese families with BBS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two families were recruited in this study. Family A was a 
four-generation family with four affected and 15 unaffected members 
participating in the study, and family B was a consanguineous family with one 
affected and three unaffected members participating. Whole exome sequencing was 
performed in the two families, followed by a multistep bioinformatics analysis. 
Sanger sequencing was used to verify the variants and to perform a segregation 
analysis. Comprehensive ocular and systemic examinations were also conducted.
RESULTS: Novel compound heterozygous variants c.235T > G (p.T79P) and 
c.534 + 1G > T were detected in the BBS2 gene in family A, and known homozygous 
variant c.748G > A (p.G250R) was detected in the MKKS gene in family B. Both 
families presented with retinitis pigmentosa; however, except for polydactyly, 
all other systemic manifestations were different. All of the affected family 
members in family A were overweight with a high body mass index (range from 26.5 
to 41.9) and high blood pressure. Family A also presented with a delay in the 
onset of secondary sex characteristics and genital anomalies, while other 
systemic abnormalities were absent in family B.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents one family with two novel BBS2 variants, 
expanding the variant spectrum of BBS, and one family with a known homozygous 
MKKS variant. The different phenotypes seen between the families with BBS2 and 
MKKS variants will contribute to the literature and our overall understanding of 
BBS.
