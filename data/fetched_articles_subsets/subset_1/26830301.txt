BACKGROUND: France is one of the European countries that spend the most on 
oncology drugs. To keep pharmaceutical expenditure under control, Health 
Authorities highly scrutinize market access of costly medicines.
OBJECTIVE: To assess current and future trends in French health technology 
assessment (HTA) of antineoplastic drugs indicated in the treatment of solid 
tumours.
METHODS: A review of the SMR and ASMR drivers of the Transparency Committee (CT) 
opinions issued for antineoplastic drugs indicated in the treatment of solid 
tumours and approved between 2009 and 2014 was performed to assess current 
trends in French health technology assessment (HTA), complemented by an expert 
board consultation to capture the critical issues on the future of 
antineoplastic drugs HTA.
RESULTS: Thirty-one drugs indicated for the treatment of solid tumours were 
identified (77 % targeted therapies). Initial CT assessments were available for 
26 drugs. Four key items in the CT assessment were identified: 1) Clinical trial 
methodology; 2) Acceptance of progression-free survival (PFS) as a valuable 
endpoint; 3) Transferability of clinical trials in clinical practice; 4) 
Unpredictability of CT decisions. Experts raised the important development of 
personalised medicines in oncology and key challenges for oncology products to 
generate information expected from HTA perspective.
CONCLUSION: The French system remains committed to its values and philosophy 
(access of all innovations for everybody) which are threatened by the increasing 
launch of innovative therapies and budget constraint. Both HTA decision 
framework evolution and revision of the current pricing process should be 
considered in France to cope with these new challenges.
