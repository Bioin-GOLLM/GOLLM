Morphologically, an inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) is usually centred in the 
submucosa. Extension of an IFP to the subserosa with destruction of the 
muscularis propria is exceedingly rare. Herein, we describe a 70-year-old woman 
who presented with right lower abdominal pain but was finally diagnosed with an 
IFP. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a target-like structure with 
a hypovascular mass at the leading edge, which was consistent with 
intussusception due to a tumour. Following surgery, the resected specimen 
displayed a mass measuring 4 × 3 × 3 cm that was protruding into the lumen. 
Microscopically, the mass was centred in the submucosa, extending up to the 
mucosal surface and down to the subserosa and serosa. The muscularis mucosae and 
muscularis propria were destroyed focally. A PDGFRA gene mutation in exon 2 
(1837_1851 del) that was found in this case, as well as a highly infiltrative 
growth pattern, strongly supported the neoplastic nature of IFP.
