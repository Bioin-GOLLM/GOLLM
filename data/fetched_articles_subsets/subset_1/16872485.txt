BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of polygenic 
etiology. Dissection of its genetic background is a complex problem, because of 
the combinatorial possibilities of gene-gene interactions. As genotyping methods 
improve throughput, approaches that can explore multigene interactions 
appropriately should lead to improved understanding of MS.
METHODS: 286 unrelated patients with definite MS and 362 unrelated healthy 
controls of Russian descent were genotyped at polymorphic loci (including SNPs, 
repeat polymorphisms, and an insertion/deletion) of the DRB1, TNF, LT, TGFbeta1, 
CCR5 and CTLA4 genes and TNFa and TNFb microsatellites. Each allele carriership 
in patients and controls was compared by Fisher's exact test, and 
disease-associated combinations of alleles in the data set were sought using a 
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo-based method recently developed by our group.
RESULTS: We identified two previously unknown MS-associated tri-allelic 
combinations:-509TGFbeta1*C, DRB1*18(3), CTLA4*G and -238TNF*B1,-308TNF*A2, 
CTLA4*G, which perfectly separate MS cases from controls, at least in the 
present sample. The previously described DRB1*15(2) allele, the microsatellite 
TNFa9 allele and the biallelic combination CCR5Delta32, DRB1*04 were also 
reidentified as MS-associated.
CONCLUSION: These results represent an independent validation of MS association 
with DRB1*15(2) and TNFa9 in Russians and are the first to find the interplay of 
three loci in conferring susceptibility to MS. They demonstrate the efficacy of 
our approach for the identification of complex-disease-associated combinations 
of alleles.
