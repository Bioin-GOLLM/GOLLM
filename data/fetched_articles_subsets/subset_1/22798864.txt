11-[1-(4-Meth-oxy-phen-yl)-4-oxo-3-phen-oxy-azetidin-2-yl]-14-methyl-12-oxa-8,14-diaza-tetra-cyclo-[8.3.3.0(1,10).0(2,7)]hexa-deca-2(7),3,5-triene-9,13-dione.

In the title compound, C(30)H(27)N(3)O(6), the furan and pyrrolidine rings adopt 
envelope conformations (with C and N atoms as the flaps, respectively). The 
piperidine ring is in a distorted boat conformation. The β-lactam ring is planar 
[maximum deviation = 0.0044 (16) Å] and forms dihedral angles of 30.61 (9) and 
85.51 (9)°, respectively, with the attached meth-oxy-phenyl and phen-oxy rings. 
The crystal packing is stabilized by N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O inter-actions forming R(2) 
(2)(8), R(2) (2)(20) and R(2) (2)(14) ring motifs. The crystal structure is 
further consolidated by weak C-H⋯π inter-actions.
