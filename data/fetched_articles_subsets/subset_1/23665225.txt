Pore-forming proteins containing the structurally conserved membrane attack 
complex/perforin fold play an important role in immunity and host-pathogen 
interactions. Intermedilysin (ILY) is an archetypal member of a 
cholesterol-dependent cytolysin subclass that hijacks the complement receptor 
CD59 to make cytotoxic pores in human cells. ILY directly competes for the 
membrane attack complex binding site on CD59, rendering cells susceptible to 
complement lysis. To understand how these bacterial pores form in lipid bilayers 
and the role CD59 plays in complement regulation, we determined the crystal 
structure of human CD59 bound to ILY. Here, we show the ILY-CD59 complex at 
3.5 Å resolution and identify two interfaces mediating this host-pathogen 
interaction. An ILY-derived peptide based on the binding site inhibits pore 
formation in a CD59-containing liposome model system. These data provide insight 
into how CD59 coordinates ILY monomers, nucleating an early prepore state, and 
suggest a potential mechanism of inhibition for the complement terminal pathway.
