We developed a new reporter cell line for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drug 
susceptibility testing. This cell line was obtained by incorporating the 
luciferase reporter gene under the control of an HCMV-specific promoter into the 
genome of astrocytoma cells (U373MG). We then used our reporter cell line to 
evaluate phenotypic changes conferred by the sequential emergence of HCMV UL54 
and UL97 mutations following long-term drug exposure. The laboratory strain 
AD169 was passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of ganciclovir 
(one viral line) or foscarnet (two viral lines). Resistant viruses were plaque 
purified at five different concentrations of ganciclovir and at three different 
concentrations of foscarnet. In addition to the previously described M460I and 
L595S UL97 mutations and the L545S and V812L UL54 mutations, exposition to 
ganciclovir (up to 3,000 microM) resulted in the selection of two unreported 
UL54 mutations (P829S and D879G). Passages in the presence of foscarnet (up to 
3,000 microM) resulted in the selection of seven not previously described UL54 
mutations (K500N, T552N, S585A, N757K, L802V, L926V, and L957F) in addition to 
the N408D mutation that has been associated with ganciclovir and cidofovir 
resistance. Long-term exposure of HCMV to either ganciclovir or foscarnet 
ultimately resulted in the selection of multiple UL54 mutations that conferred 
high levels of resistance to all approved HCMV DNA polymerase inhibitors, i.e., 
ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet. Emergence of each viral mutation 
conferred stepwise increases in drug 50% inhibitory concentrations that could be 
objectively measured with the new reporter cell assay.
