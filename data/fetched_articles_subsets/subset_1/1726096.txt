The polymerase chain reaction technique combined with restriction map analysis 
with Msp I and hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotide probes has been used 
to identify Hb Quong Sze [alpha 125(H8)Leu----Pro] in a Chinese family in 
Guangxi (Quong Sze), P. R. China. Our data and those described in an earlier 
publication (1) indicate that the Hb Quong Sze carriers originate from the same 
province of the People's Republic of China, namely Guangxi.
