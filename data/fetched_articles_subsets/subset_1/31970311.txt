BACKGROUND: Cell banking of initial outgrowths from newly derived human 
embryonic stem cells (hESCs) requires an efficient freezing method. 
Vitrification is used for the preservation of gametes and early embryos in 
assisted reproduction techniques (ART). Moreover, vitrification was applied for 
cryopreservation of hESCs using open pulled straws.
OBJECTIVE: To derive and characterize new hESC lines and then use Cryotech and 
Cryowin tools for their vitrification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human ESC lines were generated in a microdrop culture 
system using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as the feeder layer; this was 
later scaled up using both MEFs and Yazd human foreskin fibroblasts batch 8 
(YhFF#8). To bank the cell lines, master cell banks of 100 Cryotech and Cryowin 
tools were produced for each individual cell line using the vitrification 
method; flasks of hESC lines were also cryopreserved using a conventional 
slow-freezing method.
RESULTS: The pluripotency of cell lines was assessed by their expression of 
pluripotency-associated genes (OCT4/POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2) and markers such as 
SSEA4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-2-49. Their in vitro capacity to differentiate into 
germ layers and germ cells using embryoid body (EB) formation and monolayer 
culture was assessed by screening the expression of differentiation-associated 
genes. The chromosomal constitution of each hESC line was assessed by G-banding 
karyotyping.
CONCLUSION: Cryotech and Cryowin tools used to vitrify new hESCs at an early 
stage of derivation is an efficient method of preserving hESCs.
