A hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the accumulation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) 
peptide in the brain. Considerable evidence suggests that soluble Aβ oligomers 
are responsible for the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficit observed in 
AD. However, the mechanism by which these oligomers exert their neurotoxic 
effect remains unknown. Recently, it was reported that Aβ oligomers bind to the 
cellular prion protein with high affinity. Here, we show that N1, the main 
physiological cleavage fragment of the cellular prion protein, is necessary and 
sufficient for binding early oligomeric intermediates during Aβ polymerization 
into amyloid fibrils. The ability of N1 to bind Aβ oligomers is influenced by 
positively charged residues in two sites (positions 23-31 and 95-105) and is 
dependent on the length of the sequence between them. Importantly, we also show 
that N1 strongly suppresses Aβ oligomer toxicity in cultured murine hippocampal 
neurons, in a Caenorhabditis elegans-based assay, and in vivo in a mouse model 
of Aβ-induced memory dysfunction. These data suggest that N1, or small peptides 
derived from it, could be potent inhibitors of Aβ oligomer toxicity and 
represent an entirely new class of therapeutic agents for AD.
