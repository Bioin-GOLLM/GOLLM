BACKGROUND: Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv) has evolved 
resistance to the acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor penoxsulam which is used 
to control weeds in rice fields in China. The present study is conducted to 
identify the target-site resistance (TSR) mechanisms conferring resistance in a 
penoxsulam-resistant population.
RESULTS: The ALS sensitivity in vitro of the resistant population was sixfold 
lower to penoxsulam than that of the sensitive population. ALS sequencing 
revealed that no known mutation conferring ALS herbicide resistance was 
detected. However, a novel mutation Phe-206-Leu was identified in the ALS gene. 
Additionally, ALS gene expression level of the resistant population was lower 
than that of the sensitive population. Therefore, the penoxsulam resistance was 
not due to the overexpression of ALS gene. Molecular docking revealed that this 
mutation may change the interaction of the penoxsulam-ALS binding and weaken its 
mutual affinity by approximately 10%. Arabidopsis thaliana transformed with 
mutant ALS had fourfold greater resistance to penoxsulam and varied 
cross-resistance to other ALS herbicides than those transformed with sensitive 
ALS. Mutant and sensitive ALS proteins expressed by the baculovirus system 
exhibited different in vitro penoxsulam sensitivity levels. Mutant ALS had 
eightfold lower sensitivity to penoxsulam than sensitive ALS.
CONCLUSION: This report provides clear evidence that the ALS mutation at 
position 206 (Phe-206-Leu) confers penoxsulam resistance in barnyardgrass. 
Phe-206 was confirmed to be the ninth amino acid residue related to ALS 
herbicide resistance in weeds. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.
