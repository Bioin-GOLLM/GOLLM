BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile ribotype (RT) 019/sequence type (ST) 67 
strains belong to a hypervirulent lineage closely related to RT027/ST1; however, 
limited data are available for hypervirulent clade 2 lineages in Japan. Herein, 
we report the draft genome of a C. difficile strain B18-123 belonging to clade 
2, RT019/ST67 for the first time in Japan.
RESULTS: The pathogenicity locus carried by B18-123 (19.6 kb) showed higher 
homology (97.29% nucleotide identity) with strain R20291 (RT027/ST1) than the 
reference strain 630 (RT012/ST54), and B18-123 harbored 8-nucleotide 
substitutions in tcdC. However, it did not contain an 18-base pair (bp) deletion 
or a single-bp deletion at position 117 in tcdC, which was identified in the 
previous strain R20291. A cytotoxicity assay revealed similar cytotoxicity 
levels between strains B18-123 and ATCC BAA-1870 (RT027/ST1). The B18-123 strain 
was found to be susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin.
CONCLUSION: Our findings contribute to the further understanding of the 
characteristics of hypervirulent clade 2 including RT019/ST67 lineages.
