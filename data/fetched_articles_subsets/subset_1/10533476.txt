We analysed microsatellite instability (MSI) in a consecutive series of 165 
rectal carcinomas. Data on a personal and/or family history of cancer were 
collected from all patients and revealed metachronous cancer in 9 patients, 2 of 
whom had developed colorectal cancer, and a suspected familial aggregation of 
colorectal cancer in three families. Only three of the 165 (2%) rectal cancers 
showed MSI. The patients whose tumours displayed MSI had clinical histories 
suggesting hereditary cancer--a family history of colorectal cancer and/or 
synchronous colorectal cancers. Denaturing gradient gel (DGGE) analysis was used 
to screen the MSI+ patients for mutations in the hMLH1 and hMSH2 genes and 
revealed two new germline mutations; a 1 bp deletion in exon 10 of hMSH2 
creating a premature stop-codon and a splice donor site mutation in intron 16 of 
hMLH1. Considering colorectal carcinomas as a group, MSI has been reported to 
occur in approximately 10-20% of the tumours and thus can not, per se be used 
for clinical detection of hereditary tumours. This study shows, however, that 
MSI is rare in rectal carcinomas and when present strongly suggests a hereditary 
predisposition for colorectal cancer development.
