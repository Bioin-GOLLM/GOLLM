We review recent theoretical and algorithmic advances for the modeling of 
protein ligand binding free energies. We first describe a statistical mechanics 
theory of noncovalent association, with particular focus on deriving the 
fundamental formulas on which computational methods are based. The second part 
reviews the main computational models and algorithms in current use or 
development, pointing out the relations with each other and with the theory 
developed in the first part. Particular emphasis is given to the modeling of 
conformational reorganization and entropic effect. The methods reviewed are free 
energy perturbation, double decoupling, the Binding Energy Distribution Analysis 
Method, the potential of mean force method, mining minima and MM/PBSA. These 
models have different features and limitations, and their ranges of 
applicability vary correspondingly. Yet their origins can all be traced back to 
a single fundamental theory.
