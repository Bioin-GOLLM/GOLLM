PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report a case of metastatic cutaneous 
melanoma to the choroid with rapid and complete resolution of associated 
choroidal elevation and subretinal fluid after the initiation of combined 
targeted therapy.
METHODS: We describe a case of a 41-year-old man diagnosed with a metastatic 
cutaneous melanoma to the choroid of his right eye, for which treatment with 
dabrafenib/trametinib was initiated.
RESULTS: A 41-year-old man with a medical history of a BRAF 
V600E/V600E2/V600D-mutated invasive superficial spreading cutaneous melanoma 
presented with acute metamorphopsia and blurred vision in his right eye. 
Examination revealed a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/22 and two 
elevated choroidal lesions temporal to the fovea with subretinal exudation to 
the fovea on fundoscopy. On repeat examination 3 days later, his vision had 
further decreased to 20/50 with an increase of subretinal fluid. Treatment with 
BRAF/MEK inhibitor dabrafenib/trametinib was initiated, with complete resolution 
of the choroidal masses and subretinal exudation and improvement of the BCVA to 
20/22 after only 15 days. An 8-week follow-up after the start of therapy showed 
stable fundoscopic and tomographic findings, with further improvement of BCVA to 
20/17 and no ocular side effects.
CONCLUSION: A case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma to the choroid with 
choroidal elevation and subretinal exudation to the fovea, for which treatment 
with dabrafenib/trametinib was initiated. Rapid and complete resolution of 
choroidal metastasis and the associated subretinal exudation after the 
initiation of combined targeted therapy was seen, without any ocular side 
effects.
