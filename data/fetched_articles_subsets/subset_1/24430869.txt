Proto-oncogenic Src homology and collagen (Shc) proteins have been considered 
archetypal adaptors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated 
signaling. We report that in addition to its role as an EGFR-binding partner and 
Grb2 platform, ShcD acts noncanonically to promote phosphorylation of select 
EGFR residues. Unexpectedly, Y1068, Y1148, and Y1173 are subject to 
ShcD-induced, cell-autonomous hyperphosphorylation in the absence of external 
stimuli. This response is not elicited by other Shc proteins and requires the 
intrinsic EGFR kinase, as well as the ShcD phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. 
Assessments of Erk, Akt, phospholipase C 1Î³, and FAK pathways reveal no apparent 
distal signaling targets of ShcD. Nevertheless, the capacity of cultured cells 
to repopulate a wounded monolayer is markedly accelerated by ShcD in an EGFR 
kinase-dependent manner. Furthermore, detection of overexpressed ShcD coincident 
with EGFR phosphorylation in human gliomas suggests a clinical application for 
these findings. We thus demonstrate unique and relevant synergy between ShcD and 
EGFR that is unprecedented among signaling adaptors.
