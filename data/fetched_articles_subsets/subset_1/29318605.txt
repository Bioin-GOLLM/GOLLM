Telomeres are crucial in the maintenance of chromosome integrity and genomic 
stability. Critically short telomeres can trigger programed cell death while 
cells with longer telomeres may have increased likelihood of replicative errors, 
resulting in genetic mutations and chromosomal alterations, and ultimately 
promoting oncogenesis. Data on telomere length and lung cancer risk from large 
prospective cohort studies are spare. Relative telomere length in peripheral 
blood leukocytes was quantified using a validated monochrome multiplex 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method in 26,540 participants of 
the Singapore Chinese Health Study. After a follow-up of 12 years, 654 
participants developed lung cancer including 288 adenocarcinoma, 113 squamous 
cell carcinoma and 253 other/unknown histological type. The Cox proportional 
hazard regression was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI). HR of lung adenocarcinoma for individuals in the highest 
comparing the lowest 20 percentile of telomere length was 2.84 (95% CI 
1.94-4.14, ptrend  < 0.0001). This positive association was present in never 
smokers (ptrend  < 0.0001), ever smokers (ptrend  = 0.0010), men (ptrend 
 = 0.0003), women (ptrend  < 0.0001), and in shorter (ptrend  = 0.0002) and 
longer (ptrend  = 0.0001) duration of follow-up. There was no association 
between telomere length and risk of squamous cell carcinoma or other 
histological type of lung cancer in all or subgroups of individuals. The 
agreement of results from this prospective cohort study with those of previous 
prospective studies and Mendelian randomization studies suggest a possible 
etiological role of telomere length in the development of lung adenocarcinoma.
