Kawasaki disease (KD) is a vasculitis of young childhood that particularly 
affects the coronary arteries. Molecular analysis of the oligoclonal IgA 
response in acute KD led to production of synthetic KD antibodies. These 
antibodies identify intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in acute KD tissues. Light 
and electron microscopic studies indicate that the inclusion bodies are 
consistent with aggregates of viral proteins and RNA. Advances in molecular 
genetic analysis and completion of the Human Genome Project have sparked a 
worldwide effort to identify genes associated with KD. A polymorphism of one 
such gene, ITPKC, a negative regulator of T cell activation, confers 
susceptibility to KD in Japanese populations and increases the risk of 
developing coronary artery abnormalities in both Japanese and U.S. children. 
Identification of the etiologic agent and of genes conferring KD susceptibility 
are the best means of improving diagnosis and therapy and enabling prevention of 
this important disorder of childhood.
