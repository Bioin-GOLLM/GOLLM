Massive activation of dopamine neurons is critical for natural reward and drug 
abuse. In contrast, the significance of their spontaneous activity remains 
elusive. In Drosophila melanogaster, depolarization of the protocerebral 
anterior medial (PAM) cluster dopamine neurons en masse signals reward to the 
mushroom body (MB) and drives appetitive memory. Focusing on the functional 
heterogeneity of PAM cluster neurons, we identified that a single class of PAM 
neurons, PAM-γ3, mediates sugar reward by suppressing their own activity. PAM-γ3 
is selectively required for appetitive olfactory learning, while activation of 
these neurons in turn induces aversive memory. Ongoing activity of PAM-γ3 gets 
suppressed upon sugar ingestion. Strikingly, transient inactivation of basal 
PAM-γ3 activity can substitute for reward and induces appetitive memory. 
Furthermore, we identified the satiety-signaling neuropeptide Allatostatin A 
(AstA) as a key mediator that conveys inhibitory input onto PAM-γ3. Our results 
suggest the significance of basal dopamine release in reward signaling and 
reveal a circuit mechanism for negative regulation.
