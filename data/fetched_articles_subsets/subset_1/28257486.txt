PURPOSE: Exertional rhabdomyolysis can occur in individuals performing various 
types of exercise but it is unclear why some individuals develop this condition 
while others do not. Previous investigations have determined the role of several 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explain inter-individual variability 
of serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations after exertional muscle damage. 
However, there has been no research about the interrelationship among these 
SNPs. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze seven SNPs that are 
candidates for explaining individual variations of CK response after a marathon 
competition (ACE = 287bp Ins/Del, ACTN3 = p.R577X, CKMM = NcoI, IGF2 = C13790G, 
IL6 = 174G>C, MLCK = C37885A, TNFα = 308G>A).
METHODS: Using Williams and Folland's model, we determined the total genotype 
score from the accumulated combination of these seven SNPs for marathoners with 
a low CK response (n = 36; serum CK <400 U·L-1) vs. marathoners with a high CK 
response (n = 31; serum CK ≥400 U·L-1).
RESULTS: At the end of the race, low CK responders had lower serum CK (290±65 
vs. 733±405 U·L-1; P<0.01) and myoglobin concentrations (443±328 vs. 1009±971 
ng·mL-1, P<0.01) than high CK responders. Although the groups were similar in 
age, anthropometric characteristics, running experience and training habits, 
total genotype score was higher in low CK responders than in high CK responders 
(5.2±1.4 vs. 4.4±1.7 point, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Marathoners with a lower CK response after the race had a more 
favorable polygenic profile than runners with high serum CK concentrations. This 
might suggest a significant role of genetic polymorphisms in the levels of 
exertional muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. Yet other SNPs, in addition to 
exercise training, might also play a role in the values of CK after damaging 
exercise.
