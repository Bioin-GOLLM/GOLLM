There are two independent mol-ecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit of the 
title compound C11H10BrClO2, which represents the Z isomer. The methyl-acrylate 
moieties are essentially planar, within 0.084 (2) and 0.027 (5) Å in mol-ecules 
A and B, respectively. The benzene ring makes dihedral angles of 13.17 (7) and 
27.89 (9)° with the methyl-acrylate moiety in mol-ecules A and B, respectively. 
The methyl-bromide moiety is almost orthogonal to the benzene ring, making 
dihedral angles of 81.46 (16)° in mol-ecule A and 79.61 (16)° in mol-ecule B. 
The methyl-acrylate moiety exhibits an extended trans conformation in both 
mol-ecules. In the crystal, pairs of C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds result in the 
formation of quasi-centrosymmetric R 2 (2)(14) AB dimers.
