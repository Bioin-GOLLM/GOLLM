Pancreatic β-cell mass is known to be considerably altered during pregnancy and 
after parturition in rodents and humans. While β-cell mass increases during 
pregnancy and starts to return toward its original level after parturition, the 
cellular mechanisms by which β-cell mass during this period is regulated remains 
unclear. To address this issue in mice, we quantified β-cell mass and 
investigated the mechanisms underlying its regulation throughout the perinatal 
and postpartum period. The increased β-cell size and proliferation during 
pregnancy were significantly reduced shortly after parturition, whereas there 
was no evidence of β-cell reprogramming or increased apoptosis. Direct RNA 
sequencing of islets from pregnant and postpartum mice demonstrated dynamic 
changes in gene expression patterns, showing robust downregulation of cell 
cycle-related genes 1 day after parturition, and the reupregulation of serotonin 
metabolism-related genes at postpartum day 7. Serotonin synthesis was activated 
only in lactating females, accompanied by increased β-cell mass. Taken together, 
these findings demonstrate that β-cell mass is decreased shortly after 
parturition owing to reduced β-cell size and proliferation, and is subsequently 
increased, in association with lactation and serotonin biosynthesis.
