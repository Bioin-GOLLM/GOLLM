The parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes a persistent infection, Chagas disease, 
affecting millions of persons in endemic areas of Latin America. As a result of 
immigration, this disease has now been diagnosed in non-endemic areas worldwide. 
Although, the heart and gastrointestinal tract are the most studied, the 
insulin-secreting β cell of the endocrine pancreas is also a target of 
infection. In this review, we summarize available clinical and laboratory 
evidence to determine whether T. cruzi-infection-mediated changes of β cell 
function is likely to contribute to the development of hyperglycemia and 
diabetes. Our literature survey indicates that T. cruzi infection of humans and 
of experimental animals relates to altered secretory behavior of β cells. The 
mechanistic basis of these observations appears to be a change in 
stimulus-secretion pathway function rather than the loss of insulin-producing β 
cells. Whether this attenuated insulin release ultimately contributes to the 
pathogenesis of diabetes in human Chagas disease, however, remains to be 
determined. Since the etiologies of diabetes are multifactorial including 
genetic and lifestyle factors, the use of cell- and animal-based investigations, 
allowing direct manipulation of these factors, are important tools in testing if 
reduced insulin secretion has a causal influence on diabetes in the setting of 
Chagas disease. Long-term clinical investigations will be required to 
investigate this link in humans.
