The genetic basis of severe hypofibrinogenemia was analyzed in a 57-year-old 
Italian woman. She turned out to be a compound heterozygote for a novel putative 
missense mutation (Leu172Gln) and a previously described nonsense mutation 
(Arg17Stop) in the fibrinogen Bbeta-chain gene. The pathogenetic role of 
Leu172Gln was analyzed by in vitro expression of the mutant recombinant protein 
in COS-1 cells. These experiments demonstrated that mutant Bbeta-Leu172Gln 
fibrinogen was normally assembled and secreted. Inspection of the nucleotide 
sequence surrounding the mutation suggested a possible role on pre-messenger RNA 
(mRNA) splicing. Production of the mutant transcript in HeLa cells confirmed 
that the mutation activates a cryptic acceptor splice site in exon 4, resulting 
in a truncated Bbeta chain, lacking approximately 70% of the C-terminal region. 
This represents the first exonic splicing mutation identified in the fibrinogen 
genes. These findings strengthen the importance to analyze potentially 
pathogenetic nucleotide variations at both the protein and the mRNA level.
