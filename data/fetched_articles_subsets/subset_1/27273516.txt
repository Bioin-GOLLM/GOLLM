Maintenance of genome integrity requires that branched nucleic acid molecules be 
accurately processed to produce double-helical DNA. Flap endonucleases are 
essential enzymes that trim such branched molecules generated by 
Okazaki-fragment synthesis during replication. Here, we report crystal 
structures of bacteriophage T5 flap endonuclease in complexes with intact DNA 
substrates and products, at resolutions of 1.9-2.2 Ã…. They reveal 
single-stranded DNA threading through a hole in the enzyme, which is enclosed by 
an inverted V-shaped helical arch straddling the active site. Residues lining 
the hole induce an unusual barb-like conformation in the DNA substrate, thereby 
juxtaposing the scissile phosphate and essential catalytic metal ions. A series 
of complexes and biochemical analyses show how the substrate's single-stranded 
branch approaches, threads through and finally emerges on the far side of the 
enzyme. Our studies suggest that substrate recognition involves an unusual 
'fly-casting, thread, bend and barb' mechanism.
