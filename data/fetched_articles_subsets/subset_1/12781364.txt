FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha causes hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and is inhibited by 
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec). Imatinib is a potent inhibitor 
of ABL, ARG, PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, and KIT and induces durable hematologic 
responses in HES patients. However, we observed relapse with resistance to 
imatinib as consequence of a T674I mutation in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, analogous to 
the imatinib-resistant T315I mutation in BCR-ABL. We developed a murine bone 
marrow transplant model of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-induced myeloproliferative disease 
to evaluate the efficacy of PKC412, an alternative inhibitor of PDGFRalpha, for 
the treatment of HES. PKC412 is effective for treatment of 
FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-induced disease and of imatinib-induced resistance due to the 
T674I mutation. Our data establish PKC412 as molecularly targeted therapy for 
HES and other diseases expressing activated PDGFRalpha and demonstrate the 
potential of alternative kinase inhibitors to overcome resistance in target 
tyrosine kinases.
