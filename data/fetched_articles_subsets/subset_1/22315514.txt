Regulatory sequences with endosperm specificity are essential for foreign gene 
expression in the desired tissue for both grain quality improvement and 
molecular pharming. In this study, promoters of seed storage α-kafirin genes 
coupled with signal sequence (ss) were isolated from Sorghum bicolor L. Moench 
genomic DNA by PCR. The α-kafirin promoter (α-kaf) contains endosperm 
specificity-determining motifs, prolamin-box, the O2-box 1, CATC, and TATA boxes 
required for α-kafirin gene expression in sorghum seeds. The constructs 
pMB-Ubi-gfp and pMB-kaf-gfp were microprojectile bombarded into various sorghum 
and sweet corn explants. GFP expression was detected on all explants using the 
Ubi promoter but only in seeds for the α-kaf promoter. This shows that the α-kaf 
promoter isolated was functional and demonstrated seed-specific GFP expression. 
The constructs pMB-Ubi-ss-gfp and pMB-kaf-ss-gfp were also bombarded into the 
same explants. Detection of GFP expression showed that the signal peptide 
(SP)::GFP fusion can assemble and fold properly, preserving the fluorescent 
properties of GFP.
