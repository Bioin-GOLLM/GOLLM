The formation of nanodomains in the plasma membrane are thought to be part of 
membrane proteins regulation and signaling. Plasma membrane proteins are often 
investigated by analyzing the lateral mobility. k-space ICS (kICS) is a powerful 
image correlation spectroscopy (ICS) technique and a valuable supplement to 
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Here, we study the diffusion of 
aquaporin-9 (AQP9) in the plasma membrane, and the effect of different membrane 
and cytoskeleton affecting drugs, and therefore nanodomain perturbing, using 
kICS. We measured the diffusion coefficient of AQP9 after addition of these 
drugs using live cell Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence imaging on HEK-293 
cells. The actin polymerization inhibitors Cytochalasin D and Latrunculin A do 
not affect the diffusion coefficient of AQP9. Methyl-β-Cyclodextrin decreases 
GFP-AQP9 diffusion coefficient in the plasma membrane. Human epidermal growth 
factor led to an increase in the diffusion coefficient of AQP9. These findings 
led to the conclusion that kICS can be used to measure diffusion AQP9, and 
suggests that the AQP9 is not part of nanodomains.
