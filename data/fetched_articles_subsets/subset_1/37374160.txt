Bone mechanics is well understood at every length scale except the nano-level. 
We aimed to investigate the relationship between bone nanoscale and tissue-level 
mechanics experimentally. We tested two hypotheses: (1) nanoscale strains were 
lower in hip fracture patients versus controls, and (2) nanoscale mineral and 
fibril strains were inversely correlated with aging and fracture. A 
cross-sectional sample of trabecular bone sections was prepared from the 
proximal femora of two human donor groups (aged 44-94 years): an aging 
non-fracture control group (n = 17) and a hip-fracture group (n = 20). Tissue, 
fibril, and mineral strain were measured simultaneously using synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction during tensile load to failure, then compared between groups using 
unpaired t-tests and correlated with age using Pearson's correlation. Controls 
exhibited significantly greater peak tissue, mineral, and fibril strains than 
the hip fracture (all p < 0.05). Age was associated with a decrease in peak 
tissue (p = 0.099) and mineral (p = 0.004) strain, but not fibril strain (p = 
0.260). Overall, hip fracture and aging were associated with changes in the 
nanoscale strain that are reflected at the tissue level. Data must be 
interpreted within the limitations of the observational cross-sectional study 
design, so we propose two new hypotheses on the importance of nanomechanics. (1) 
Hip fracture risk is increased by low tissue strain, which can be caused by low 
collagen or mineral strain. (2) Age-related loss of tissue strain is dependent 
on the loss of mineral but not fibril strain. Novel insights into bone nano- and 
tissue-level mechanics could provide a platform for the development of bone 
health diagnostics and interventions based on failure mechanisms from the 
nanoscale up.
