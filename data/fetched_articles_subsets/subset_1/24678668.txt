Peridinin-Chlorophyll-α-Proteins (PCPs) are water-soluble light harvesting 
complexes from dinoflagellates. They have unique light-harvesting and energy 
transfer properties which have been studied in details in the last 15 years. 
This review aims to give an overview on all the main aspects of PCPs 
photophysics, with an emphasis on some aspects which have not been reviewed in 
details so far, such as vibrational spectroscopy studies, theoretical 
calculations, and magnetic resonance studies. A paragraph on the present 
development of PCPs towards technological applications is also included.
