Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions that affect 
predominantly microvasculature in the brain and spinal cord. CCM can occur 
either in sporadic or familial form, characterized by autosomal dominant 
inheritance and development of multiple lesions throughout the patient's life. 
Three genes associated with CCM are known: CCM1/KRIT1 (krev interaction trapped 
1), CCM2/MGC4607 (encoding a protein named malcavernin), and CCM3/PDCD10 
(programmed cell death 10). All the mutations identified in these genes cause a 
loss of function and compromise the protein functions needed for maintaining the 
vascular barrier integrity. Loss of function of CCM proteins causes molecular 
disorganization and dysfunction of endothelial adherens junctions. In this 
review, we provide an overall vision of the CCM pathology, starting with the 
genetic bases of the disease, describing the role of the proteins, until we 
reach the cellular level. Thus, we summarize the genetics of CCM, providing a 
description of CCM genes and mutation features, provided an updated knowledge of 
the CCM protein structure and function, and discuss the molecular mechanisms 
through which CCM proteins may act within endothelial cells, particularly in 
endothelial barrier maintenance/regulation and in cellular signaling.
