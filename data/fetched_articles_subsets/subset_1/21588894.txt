Hexamethyl-phospho-ramide (hmp), tetra-thio-molybdate, silver sulfide and 
dysprosium nitrate were self-assembled to form an anionic [AgMoS(4)](n) (n-) 
chain in the title complex, {[Dy(NO(3))(2)(C(6)H(18)N(3)OP)(4)][AgMoS(4)]}(n). 
The central Dy atom in the cation is coordinated by eight O atoms from two 
nitrate and four hmp ligands, resulting in a distorted square-anti-prismatic 
environment. Together with the two nitrate ligands, the cation is monovalent, 
which leads to the anionic chain having an [AgMoS(4)] repeat unit. The polymeric 
anionic chain, with Mo-Ag-Mo and Ag-Mo-Ag angles of 161.911 (13) and 
154.014 (13)°, respectively, presents a distorted linear configuration. The 
title complex is isostructural with the W analogue.
