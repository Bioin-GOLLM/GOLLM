Plant pathogens secrete effector molecules during host invasion to promote 
colonization. However, some of these effectors become recognized by host 
receptors to mount a defence response and establish immunity. Recently, a novel 
resistance was identified in wild tomato, mediated by the single dominant V2 
locus, to control strains of the soil-borne vascular wilt fungus Verticillium 
dahliae that belong to race 2. With comparative genomics of race 2 strains and 
resistance-breaking race 3 strains, we identified the avirulence effector that 
activates V2 resistance, termed Av2. We identified 277 kb of race 2-specific 
sequence comprising only two genes encoding predicted secreted proteins that are 
expressed during tomato colonization. Subsequent functional analysis based on 
genetic complementation into race 3 isolates and targeted deletion from the race 
1 isolate JR2 and race 2 isolate TO22 confirmed that one of the two candidates 
encodes the avirulence effector Av2 that is recognized in V2 tomato plants. Two 
Av2 allelic variants were identified that encode Av2 variants that differ by a 
single acid. Thus far, a role in virulence could not be demonstrated for either 
of the two variants.
