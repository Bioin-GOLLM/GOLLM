Mitochondria play a critical role in providing energy, maintaining cellular 
metabolism, and regulating cell survival and death. To carry out these crucial 
functions, mitochondria employ more than 1500 proteins, distributed between two 
membranes and two aqueous compartments. An extensive network of dedicated 
proteins is engaged in importing and sorting these nuclear-encoded proteins into 
their designated mitochondrial compartments. Defects in this fundamental system 
are related to a variety of pathologies, particularly engaging the most 
energy-demanding tissues. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art 
knowledge about the mitochondrial protein import machinery and describe the 
known interrelation of its failure with age-related neurodegenerative and 
cardiovascular diseases.
