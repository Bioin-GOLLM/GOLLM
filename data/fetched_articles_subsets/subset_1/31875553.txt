Antibodies targeting the receptor binding site (RBS) of the influenza virus 
hemagglutinin (HA) protein are usually not broadly reactive because their 
footprints are typically large and extend to nearby variable HA residues. Here, 
we identify several human H3N2 HA RBS-targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
that are sensitive to substitutions in conventional antigenic sites and are 
therefore not broadly reactive. However, we also identify an H3N2 HA 
RBS-targeting mAb that is exceptionally broadly reactive despite being sensitive 
to substitutions in residues outside of the RBS. We show that similar antibodies 
are present at measurable levels in the sera of some individuals but that they 
are inefficiently elicited by conventional vaccines. Our data indicate that HA 
RBS-targeting antibodies can be effective against variable viral strains even 
when they are somewhat sensitive to substitutions in HA residues adjacent to the 
RBS.
