INTRODUCTION: 5alpha-Steroid reductase deficiency (5alphaSRD) is an autosomal 
recessive enzymatic deficiency. Mutations in the 5alpha-steroid reductase type 2 
gene (SRD5A2) result in male pseudohermaphroditism caused by decreased 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) synthesis--a key hormone of virilization of male 
external genitalia.
AIM: To study for the first time patients from the Greek Cypriot population, 
describe their clinical characteristics, and identify the genetic mutations of 
the SRD5A2 gene.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three unrelated patients with 46,XY karyotype born with 
ambiguous genitalia were examined. Patient 1 was raised as a girl and was 
diagnosed with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, based on the clinical 
picture and incomplete laboratory investigation at the age of 4 years, and 
underwent gonadectomy. For this patient sequencing analysis of all five exons of 
the SRD5A2 gene and exons 2 to 8 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene was 
performed. Patients 2 and 3 were also born with ambiguous genitalia. The hCG 
test for these two patients was informative of 5alphaSRD, as it showed elevated 
T/DHT ratio after stimulation. Despite genetic counseling, both families decided 
to raise their infants as females because of severe under-virilization. 
Sequencing of the SRD5A2 gene was also completed for both patients.
RESULTS: No mutations were found in the AR sequence for patient 1. Patients 1 
and 3 were found homozygous for the mutation A/G at splice junction intron 
1/exon 2 and patient 2 was found heterozygous for the same A/G substitution and 
also heterozygous for an additional mutation, Pro181Leu, in exon 3.
CONCLUSIONS: The same mutation in the SRD5A2 gene was identified in three 
unrelated patients, in both homozygous and heterozygous form. This splice 
mutation was previously reported in Turkish patients. This underlying genetic 
abnormality may be characteristic for the Eastern Mediterranean region and is 
likely due to an ancestor effect.
