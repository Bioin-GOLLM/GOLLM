BACKGROUND: Toll like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in innate immunity 
and various studies suggest that TLRs play a crucial role in pathogenesis of 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The present study aims in looking into the 
status of crucial host and viral gene expression on inciting TLR7.
METHODS: The transcription of TLR7 pathway signaling molecules and HBV DNA viral 
load were quantified by Real Time-PCR after stimulation of TLR7 with its 
imiquimod based ligand, R837. Cell cycle analysis was performed using 
flow-cytometry. Expression of TLR7 and chief cell cycle regulator governing G1/S 
transition, p53 was also seen in liver biopsysss samples of CHB patients. HBV 
induced alteration in histone modifications in HepG2 cells and its restoration 
on TLR7 activation was determined using western blot.
RESULTS: The TLR7 expression remains downregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells and in 
liver biopsy samples from CHB patients. Interestingly HBV DNA viral load showed 
an inverse relationship with the TLR7 expression in the biopsy samples. We also 
evaluated the anti-viral activity of R837, an agonist of TLR7. It was observed 
that there was a suppression of HBV replication and viral protein production 
upon TLR7 stimulation. R837 triggers the anti-viral action probably through the 
Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway. We also observed a downregulation of 
histone H3K9Me3 repression mark upon R837 treatment in HBV replicating 
HepG2.2.15 cells, mimicking that of un-infected HepG2 cells. Additionally, the 
G1/S cell cycle arrest introduced by HBV in HepG2.2.15 cells was released upon 
ligand treatment.
CONCLUSION: The study thus holds a close insight into the changes in hepatocyte 
micro-environment on TLR7 stimulation in HBV infection.
