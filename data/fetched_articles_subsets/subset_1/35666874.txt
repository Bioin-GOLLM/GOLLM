Single-cell transcriptomics has revealed specific glial activation states 
associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. While these findings may eventually lead to 
new therapeutic opportunities, little is known about how these glial responses 
are reflected by biomarker changes in bodily fluids. Such knowledge, however, 
appears crucial for patient stratification, as well as monitoring disease 
progression and treatment responses in clinical trials. Here, we took advantage 
of well-described mouse models of β-amyloidosis and α-synucleinopathy to explore 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome changes related to their respective 
proteopathic lesions. Nontargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
revealed that the majority of proteins that undergo age-related changes in CSF 
of either mouse model were linked to microglia and astrocytes. Specifically, we 
identified a panel of more than 20 glial-derived proteins that were increased in 
CSF of aged β-amyloid precursor protein- and α-synuclein-transgenic mice and 
largely overlap with previously described disease-associated glial genes 
identified by single-cell transcriptomics. Our results also show that enhanced 
shedding is responsible for the increase of several of the identified glial CSF 
proteins as exemplified for TREM2. Notably, the vast majority of these proteins 
can also be quantified in human CSF and reveal changes in Alzheimer’s disease 
cohorts. The finding that cellular transcriptome changes translate into 
corresponding changes of CSF proteins is of clinical relevance, supporting 
efforts to identify fluid biomarkers that reflect the various functional states 
of glial responses in cerebral proteopathies, such as Alzheimer’s and 
Parkinson’s disease.
