Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is highly and 
specifically expressed in a subset of lethal glioblastoma (GBM), making the 
receptor a unique therapeutic target for GBM. Recently, bispecific antibodies 
(BsAbs) have shown exciting clinical benefits in cancer immunotherapy. Here, we 
report remarkable results for GBM treatment with a BsAb constructed by the 
"BAPTS" method. The BsAb was characterized through LC/MS, SEC-HPLC, and SPR. 
Furthermore, the BsAb was evaluated in vitro for bioactivities through FACS, 
antigen-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and a cytokine secretion assay, 
as well as in vivo for antitumor activity and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters 
through immunodeficient NOD/SCID and BALB/c mouse models. The results indicated 
that the EGFRvIII-BsAb eliminated EGFRvIII-positive GBM cells by recruiting and 
stimulating effector T cells secreting cytotoxic cytokines that killed GBM cells 
in vitro. The results demonstrated the antitumor potential and long circulation 
time of EGFRvIII-BsAb in NOD/SCID mice bearing de2-7 subcutaneously heterotopic 
transplantation tumors and BALB/c mice. In conclusion, our experiments in both 
in vitro and in vivo have shown the remarkable antitumor activities of 
EGFRvIII-BsAb, highlighting its potential in clinical applications for the 
treatment of GBM. Additional merits, including a long circulation time and low 
immunogenicity, have also made the novel BsAb a promising therapeutic candidate.
