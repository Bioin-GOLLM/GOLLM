Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays important roles in the 
pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Several single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP) of the VEGF gene have been identified and are associated 
with the aberrant secretion of VEGF protein. This meta-analysis aimed to 
evaluate the impact of the VEGF +405G>C (rs2010963), -460C>T (rs833061) and 
-2578A>C (rs699947) polymorphisms on PCOS susceptibility. A systematic search of 
the Embase, PubMed, Web of Science and Wanfang databases was carried out to 
identify relevant studies published before 19 July 2019. Seven eligible studies 
were included in this meta-analysis involving 1100 patients with PCOS and 1141 
control individuals. The pooled analysis revealed no significant association 
between PCOS risk and the +405G>C (rs2010963), -460C>T (rs833061) or -2578A>C 
(rs699947) polymorphisms in women. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity indicated that 
Asian women carrying the VEGF +405C allele had a lower risk of PCOS (C versus G: 
odds ratio [OR] 0.731, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.544-0.982, P < 0.05, 
I2 = 46.4%; CG versus GG: OR 0.667, 95% CI 0.469-0.948, P < 0.05, I2 = 18.4%; CC 
versus GG: OR 0.611, 95% CI 0.390-0.958, P < 0.05, I2 = 24.3%). The study 
demonstrates that for all women regardless of ethnicity, no significant 
associations between VEGF SNP and PCOS were observed; however, +405G>C 
(rs2010963) may protect Asian women from PCOS.
