BACKGROUND AND AIMS: GLCCI1 variations are found to be associated with response 
to glucocorticoid therapy in non-Hispanic white subjects with asthma. However, 
there are also other relevant studies that were not consistent with this 
finding. In this study we aimed to evaluate the association of GLCCI1 variations 
with asthma susceptibility and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) response in a 
Chinese adult Han population.
METHODS: We genotyped 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms of GLCCI1 in 182 
asthmatic patients and 180 healthy controls. Furthermore, we analyzed the 
association of GLCCI1 variations with ICS response in 30 mild-to-moderate 
asthmatics.
RESULTS: rs11976862 homozygote mutant genotype GG was nominally associated with 
increased asthma risk (OR = 2.435, 95% CI: 1.221-4.854, p = 0.01148, 
p(corr) = 0.0127). Recessive model of rs37972, rs37973 and rs11976862 showed 
that the rare alleles were correlated with less improvement in FEV1 after 
fluticasone treatment for 12 weeks (p = 0.004, p = 0.009 and p = 0.039, 
respectively). The GLCCI1 mRNA expression level decreased obviously in 
asthmatics than in healthy controls (0.037663 ± 0.0216833 vs. 
0.046352 ± 0.0235812, p = 0.000). For asthmatics, GLCCI1 mRNA expression level 
significantly increased after fluticasone treatment for 12 weeks 
(0.067641 ± 0.031547 vs. 0.030048 ± 0.014613, p = 0.000). Moreover, changes of 
GLCCI1 mRNA expression were significantly related with rs37973 and rs11976862 in 
a recessive model (p = 0.014 and p = 0.033, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: GLCCI1 variations are associated with asthma susceptibility and ICS 
response in a Chinese Han adult population. GLCCI1 variations may affect ICS 
response by modulating GLCCI1 expression.
