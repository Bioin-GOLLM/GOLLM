The Cold Neutron Depth Profiling (CNDP) instrument at the NIST Cold Neutron 
Research Facility (CNRF) is now operational. The neutron beam originates from a 
16 L D2O ice cold source and passes through a filter of 135 mm of single crystal 
sapphire. The neutron energy spectrum may be described by a 65 K Maxwellian 
distribution. The sample chamber configuration allows for remote controlled 
scanning of 150 Ã— 150 mm sample areas including the varying of both sample and 
detector angle. The improved sensitivity over the current thermal depth 
profiling instrument has permitted the first nondestructive measurements of 17O 
profiles. This paper describes the CNDP instrument, illustrates the neutron 
depth profiling (NDP) technique with examples, and gives a separate bibliography 
of NDP publications.
