Although the role of astrocyte glutamate transporters in glutamate clearance is 
well illustrated, the role of glutamine synthetase (GS) that influences this 
process remains to be elucidated. We examined whether GS affected the uptake of 
glutamate in astrocytes in vitro. The glutamate uptake was assessed by measuring 
the concentration of glutamate and glutamine in culture medium in the presence 
or absence of glutamate. We demonstrated that inhibition of GS in astrocytes by 
MSO significantly impaired glutamate uptake and glutamine release. Conversely, 
induction of GS expression in astrocytes by gene transfer significantly enhanced 
the glutamate uptake and glutamine release. When an inflammatory cytokine tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was applied to the cultures, it significantly 
reduced GS expression and inhibited glutamate-induced GS activation resulting in 
increased excitotoxicity to neurons. These results suggest that GS in astrocytes 
may represent a novel target for neuroprotection against neuronal dysfunction 
and death that occur in many neurological disorders.
