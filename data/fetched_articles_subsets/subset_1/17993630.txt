Voltage-dependent potassium KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) channels play a prominent role in the 
control of neuronal excitability. These channels must associate with calmodulin 
to function correctly and, indeed, a mutation (R353G) that impairs this 
association provokes the onset of a form of human neonatal epilepsy known as 
benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC). We show here that perturbation of 
calmodulin binding leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of KCNQ2, 
reducing the number of channels that reach the plasma membrane. Interestingly, 
elevating the expression of calmodulin in the BFNC mutant partially restores the 
intracellular distribution of the KCNQ channel. In contrast, overexpression of a 
Ca(2+)-binding incompetent calmodulin or sequestering of calmodulin promotes the 
retention of wild-type channels in the ER. Thus, a direct interaction with 
Ca(2+)-calmodulin appears to be critical for the correct activity of KCNQ2 
potassium channels as it controls the channels' exit from the ER.
