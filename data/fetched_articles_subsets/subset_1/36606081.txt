Visualization of genomic loci with open chromatin state has been reported in 
mammalian tissue culture cells using a CRISPR/Cas9-based system that utilizes an 
EGFP-tagged endonuclease-deficient Cas9 protein (dCas9::EGFP) (Chen et al. 
2013). Here, we adapted this approach for use in Caenorhabditis elegans . We 
generated a C. elegans strain that expresses the dCas9 protein fused to two 
nuclear-localized EGFP molecules (dCas9::NLS::2xEGFP::NLS) in an inducible 
manner. Using this strain, we report the visualization in live C. elegans 
embryos of two endogenous repetitive loci, rrn-4 and rrn-1 , from which 5S and 
18S ribosomal RNAs are constitutively generated.
