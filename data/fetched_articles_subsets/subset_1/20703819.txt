BACKGROUND: In colorectal cancer (CRC), microsatellite instability (MSI) is a 
valuable marker of defective DNA mismatch repair that identifies cancers with 
distinct phenotypic properties, including favorable survival. However, the 
optimal assay for MSI status is unknown. We have evaluated a simplified 3-marker 
assay for MSI and compared it with the 5-marker (NCI) assay to see if technical 
variations in MSI testing are important.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA samples from 357 CRCs were evaluated for MSI using 
the 5 microsatellite markers recommended for the NCI assay (BAT 25, BAT26, 
D2S123, D5S346, and D17S250). Results were compared with a simplified 3-marker 
assay (BAT25, BAT26, and D2S123). CRCs identified as MSI were evaluated for 
their clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics.
RESULTS: The 5-marker assay identified 96 cancers as MSI. Only 56 of these were 
MSI by the 3-marker assay (3-marker+ group), leaving 40 cases identified as MSI 
only by NCI criteria (3-marker- group). The remaining 261 cancers were 
microsatellite stable (MSS). The 3-marker+ MSI tumors had features 
characteristic of MSI tumors: more proximal, poorly differentiated, associated 
with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), more BRAF mutations, 
fewer KRAS mutations, better 5-year disease-specific survival, more frequent 
mismatch repair (MMR) protein loss, and less likely to be metastatic on 
presentation (P < .05). Chromosomal arm loss was observed only in 3-marker- MSI 
and MSS cancers (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The 3-marker MSI assay outperforms the traditional 5-marker assay 
for identifying patients with favorable prognosis and homogeneous clinical and 
genetic features. More accurate MSI testing should improve prognostic and 
predictive scoring systems for colorectal cancer.
