BACKGROUND: Most high-throughput screening (HTS) systems studying the cytotoxic 
effect of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells on tumor cells rely on 
two-dimensional cell culture that does not recapitulate the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). Tumor spheroids, however, can recapitulate the TME and 
have been used for cytotoxicity assays of CAR T cells. But a major obstacle to 
the use of tumor spheroids for cytotoxicity assays is the difficulty in 
separating unbound CAR T and dead tumor cells from spheroids. Here, we present a 
three-dimensional hanging spheroid plate (3DHSP), which facilitates the 
formation of spheroids and the separation of unbound and dead cells from 
spheroids during cytotoxicity assays.
RESULTS: The 3DHSP is a 24-well plate, with each well composed of a hanging 
dripper, spheroid wells, and waste wells. In the dripper, a tumor spheroid was 
formed and mixed with CAR T cells. In the 3DHSP, droplets containing the 
spheroids were deposited into the spheroid separation well, where unbound and 
dead T and tumor cells were separated from the spheroid through a gap into the 
waste well by tilting the 3DHSP by more than 20°. Human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumor cells (BT474 and SKOV3) formed spheroids of 
approximately 300-350 μm in diameter after 2 days in the 3DHSP. The cytotoxic 
effects of T cells engineered to express CAR recognizing HER2 (HER2-CAR T cells) 
on these spheroids were directly measured by optical imaging, without the use of 
live/dead fluorescent staining of the cells. Our results suggest that the 3DHSP 
could be incorporated into a HTS system to screen for CARs that enable T cells 
to kill spheroids formed from a specific tumor type with high efficacy or for 
spheroids consisting of tumor types that can be killed efficiently by T cells 
bearing a specific CAR.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the 3DHSP could be incorporated into a HTS 
system for the cytotoxic effects of CAR T cells on tumor spheroids.
