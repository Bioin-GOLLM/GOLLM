The common variants in the fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene have been 
previously found to be associated with obesity in various adult populations. The 
objective of the present study was to investigate whether the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks in various regions 
of the FTO gene are associated with predisposition to obesity in Malaysian 
Malays. Thirty-one FTO SNPs were genotyped in 587 (158 obese and 429 non-obese) 
Malaysian Malay subjects. Obesity traits and lipid profiles were measured and 
single-marker association testing, LD testing, and haplotype association 
analysis were performed. LD analysis of the FTO SNPs revealed the presence of 57 
regions with complete LD (D' = 1.0). In addition, we detected the association of 
rs17817288 with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The FTO gene may therefore 
be involved in lipid metabolism in Malaysian Malays. Two haplotype blocks were 
present in this region of the FTO gene, but no particular haplotype was found to 
be significantly associated with an increased risk of obesity in Malaysian 
Malays.
