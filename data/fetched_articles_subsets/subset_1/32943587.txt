Coronavirus family has caused several human illnesses, the latest caused by 
SARS-CoV-2, has led to COVID-19 pandemic posing serious threat to global health. 
A SARS-CoV-2 variant encoding a D614G mutation in the viral spike (S) protein 
has now become the most prevalent form of the virus worldwide, suggesting a 
fitness advantage for the mutant. The G614 variant is associated with higher 
upper respiratory tract viral load, higher infectivity, increased total S 
protein incorporation into the virion, reduced S1 shedding and a conformational 
change leading to a more ACE2- binding and fusion- competent state. However, it 
does not seem to be correlated to increased disease severity or escape 
neutralizing antibodies.
