BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Several brands of calcium silicate-based cements (CSBCs) are 
currently marketed. Here we compared physicochemical and biological properties 
of new products Ortho MTA (BioMTA), Retro MTA (BioMTA), and EZ-Seal (Ezekiel) to 
widely used ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Tulsa).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CSBCs were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry and examined 
by scanning electron microscopy. Elemental composition was determined by energy 
dispersive spectroscopy. Particle size was measured by particle size analyzer. 
Human stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) were incubated with eluates from 
CSBCs. Survival of SCAP cells was evaluated with MTT assay. The Alizarin red S 
stain was used to identify calcified nodules formed in SCAP cultures. The 
effects of CSBC eluates on SCAP proliferation and migration were examined using 
an in-vitro scratch "wound-healing" assay.
RESULTS: All CSBC specimens showed similar X-ray diffraction patterns. The 
average particle size of EZ-Seal was smaller than ProRoot MTA, Ortho MTA, and 
Retro MTA (P < 0.001). The least cytotoxicity of eluates was found for EZ-Seal. 
In the Alizarin red S staining test, calcified nodules were observed in cultures 
with ProRoot MTA, Ortho MTA, and Retro MTA, however, no calcified nodules were 
observed in cultures with EZ-Seal. SCAP proliferation and migration capacity in 
presence of EZ-Seal was higher than with ProRoot MTA, Ortho MTA, and Retro MTA 
(P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: EZ-Seal has a smaller average particle size and a better 
cytocompatibility than all other examined CSBCs.
