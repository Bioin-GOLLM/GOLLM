Multiple covalent modifications of Trg, a sensory transducer of Escherichia 
coli.

The sensory transducers of Escherichia coli are integral membrane proteins that 
mediate the tactic response of cells to chemical stimuli. Adaptation to 
environmental stimuli is correlated with methylation of the transducer proteins. 
Two transducer genes, tsr and tar, exhibit extensive homologies while no 
homology has been detected between a third transducer, trg, and those genes. The 
Tsr and Tar proteins have been shown to contain multiple sites for methylation 
as well as two sites for another modification that requires an active cheB gene 
product and is designated the CheB-dependent modification. In this study, 
covalent modifications of the Trg protein were characterized by analysis of 
tryptic peptides. We found that methylation occurred at several sites on the Trg 
protein and that the protein contained at least three sites for CheB-dependent 
modification, two of which were located on a tryptic peptide that contains both 
methionine and lysine. This tryptic peptide is analogous to the methionine- and 
lysine-containing methyl-accepting peptides isolated from the Tsr and Tar 
proteins and like those peptides may contain several methyl-accepting sites. We 
estimated the pKa of the group created by the CheB-dependent modification on the 
methionine- and lysine-containing peptide of Trg to be between pH 2.2 and 5.8. 
This result supports the idea that the CheB-dependent modification is an 
enzymatic deamidation of glutamine to glutamic acid.
