ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification that can alter the 
physical and chemical properties of target proteins and that controls many 
important cellular processes. Macrodomains are evolutionarily conserved 
structural domains that bind ADP-ribose derivatives and are found in proteins 
with diverse cellular functions. Some proteins from the macrodomain family can 
hydrolyze ADP-ribosylated substrates and therefore reverse this 
post-translational modification. Bacteria and Streptomyces, in particular, are 
known to utilize protein ADP-ribosylation, yet very little is known about their 
enzymes that synthesize and remove this modification. We have determined the 
crystal structure and characterized, both biochemically and functionally, the 
macrodomain protein SCO6735 from Streptomyces coelicolor This protein is a 
member of an uncharacterized subfamily of macrodomain proteins. Its crystal 
structure revealed a highly conserved macrodomain fold. We showed that SCO6735 
possesses the ability to hydrolyze PARP-dependent protein ADP-ribosylation. 
Furthermore, we showed that expression of this protein is induced upon DNA 
damage and that deletion of this protein in S. coelicolor increases antibiotic 
production. Our results provide the first insights into the molecular basis of 
its action and impact on Streptomyces metabolism.
