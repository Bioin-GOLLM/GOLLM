The α3 Na+,K+-ATPase (α3NKA) is one of four known α isoforms of the mammalian 
transporter. A deficiency in α3NKA is linked to severe movement control 
disorders. Understanding the pathogenesis of these disorders is limited by an 
incomplete knowledge of α3NKA expression in the brain as well as the challenges 
associated with identifying living cells that express the isoform for subsequent 
electrophysiological studies. To address this problem, transgenic mice were 
generated on the C57BL/6 genetic background, which utilize the mouse α3 subunit 
gene (Atp1a3) promoter to drive the expression of ZsGreen1 fluorescent protein. 
Consistent with published results on α3NKA distribution, a ZsGreen1 signal was 
detected in the brain, but not in the liver, with Atp1a3-ZsGreen1 transgenic 
mice. The intensity of ZsGreen1 fluorescence in neuronal cell bodies varied 
considerably in the brain, being highest in the brainstem, deep cerebellar and 
select thalamic nuclei, and relatively weak in cortical regions. Fluorescence 
was not detected in astrocytes or white matter areas. ZsGreen1-positive neurons 
were readily observed in fresh (unfixed) brain sections, which were amenable to 
patch-clamp recordings. Thus, the α3NKA-ZsGreen1 mouse model provides a powerful 
tool for studying the distribution and functional properties of α3NKA-expressing 
neurons in the brain.
