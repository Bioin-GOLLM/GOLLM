Preeclampsia (PE) is a common vascular disease of pregnancy with genetic 
predisposition. Dysregulation of the complement system has been implicated, but 
molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this study, we determined 
the potential linkage of severe PE to the most central complement gene, C3. 
Three cohorts of Finnish patients and controls were recruited for a genetic 
case-control study. Participants were genotyped using Sequenom genotyping and 
Sanger sequencing. Initially, we studied 259 Finnish patients with severe PE and 
426 controls from the Southern Finland PE and the Finnish population-based PE 
cohorts. We used a custom-made single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping 
assay consisting of 98 SNPs in 18 genes that encode components of the complement 
system. Following the primary screening, C3 was selected as the candidate gene 
and consequently Sanger sequenced. Fourteen SNPs from C3 were also genotyped by 
a Sequenom panel in 960 patients with severe PE and 705 controls, including 
already sequenced individuals. Three of the 43 SNPs observed within C3 were 
associated with severe PE: rs2287845 (p = 0.038, OR = 1.158), rs366510 
(p = 0.039, OR = 1.158), and rs2287848 (p = 0.041, OR = 1.155). We also 
discovered 16 SNP haplotypes with extreme linkage disequilibrium in the middle 
of the gene with a protective (p = 0.044, OR = 0.628) or a predisposing 
(p = 0.011, OR = 2.110) effect to severe PE depending on the allele combination. 
Genetic variants associated with PE are located in key domains of C3 and could 
thereby influence the function of C3. This is, as far as we are aware, the first 
candidate gene in the complement system with an association to a clinically 
relevant PE subphenotype, severe PE. The result highlights a potential role for 
the complement system in the pathogenesis of PE and may help in defining 
prognostic and therapeutic subgroups of preeclamptic women.
