BACKGROUND: The knowledge about the impact of oral motor impairment in 
neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) is limited but increasing.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to collect and compile knowledge on how 
muscle weakness in congenital or early developing NMDs directly or indirectly 
affects feeding, swallowing, speech and saliva control.
METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed from January 1, 1998, to 
August 31, 2021. The keywords "feeding", "dysphagia", "swallowing", 
"dysarthria", "speech", "drooling" and "sialorrhea" were used in combination 
with "paediatric neuromuscular disease" or specific diagnoses.
RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were selected for the review, 33 focused on feeding 
and swallowing, 11 on speech, four on a combination of feeding, swallowing, 
saliva control or speech and 17 general descriptions. Most of the studies 
reported on patients with a disorder affecting muscles. These studies show that 
muscle weakness and impaired motility affecting the muscles innervated by the 
cranial nerves may influence feeding, swallowing, and speech, and that 
respiratory function, general health and neurodevelopmental delay also influence 
these functions. Feeding impairment and breathing difficulties are common in 
NMDs. Lifesaving interventions such as tube feeding and ventilatory support are 
common in severe cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Feeding impairment, dysphagia and dysarthria are prevalent in NMDs 
with congenital or early age of onset. Feeding and swallowing has been studied 
more than speech and saliva control. More children with NMD survive thanks to 
new treatment options and it is therefore urgent to follow up how these 
therapies may impact the development of feeding, swallowing, and speech.
