We investigated whether β-adrenergic antagonists attenuates dietary fat 
absorption through the regulation of pancreatic lipase (PNLIP) expression in 
pancreatic acinar cells in the context of high fat diet feeding. Male 
six-week-old C57BL/6 mice were assigned into an ad libitum fed control diet 
(CON) and a high fat diet (HIGH). Within each diet group, subgroups of mice were 
treated with vehicle (VEH) or propranolol, a β-adrenergic antagonist (BB). Over 
12 weeks, body weight gain observed in HIGHVEH was mitigated in HIGHBB (+103% 
vs. +72%). Increase in fecal fat amount observed in HIGHVEH was further 
increased in HIGHBB. Increase in PNLIP expressions observed in HIGHVEH 
pancreatic tissues was abolished in HIGHBB. PNLIP expression in mouse primary 
pancreatic acinar cells and 266-6 cell lines increased with isoproterenol 
treatment, which was blocked by propranolol. Isoproterenol increased PNLIP 
expression in a cAMP/protein kinase A/ cyclic AMP response element binding 
protein (CREB)-dependent manner. CREB directly bound to the CRE on the mouse 
PNLIP promoter and transactivated PNLIP expression. These results suggest that 
sympathetic activation increases dietary fat absorption through the upregulation 
of PNLIP expression and that a β-adrenergic antagonist attenuates obesity 
development partly through the downregulation of PNLIP expression and inhibition 
of dietary fat absorption in the context of high fat diet feeding.
