BACKGROUND: The incidence of kidney disease caused by thyroid cancer is rising 
worldwide. Observational studies cannot recognize whether thyroid cancer is 
independently associated with kidney disease. We performed the Mendelian 
randomization (MR) approach to genetically investigate the causality of thyroid 
cancer on immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We explored the causal effect of thyroid cancer on IgAN by 
MR analysis. Fifty-two genetic loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms were 
related to thyroid cancer. The primary approach in this MR analysis was the 
inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and MR‒Egger was the secondary method. 
Weighted mode and penalized weighted median were used to analyze the 
sensitivity. In this study, the random-effect IVW models showed the causal 
impact of genetically predicted thyroid cancer across the IgAN risk (OR, 1.191; 
95% CI, 1.131-1.253, P < 0.001). Similar results were also obtained in the 
weighted mode method (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 0.980-1.120, P = 0.179) and penalized 
weighted median (OR, 1.185; 95% CI, 1.110-1.264, P < 0.001). However, the 
MR‒Egger method revealed that thyroid cancer decreased the risk of IgAN, but 
this difference was not significant (OR, 0.948; 95% CI, 0.855-1.051, P = 0.316). 
The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis did not reveal the driving influence of 
any individual SNP on the association between thyroid cancer and IgAN.
CONCLUSION: The IVW model indicated a significant causality of thyroid cancer 
with IgAN. However, MR‒Egger had a point estimation in the opposite direction. 
According to the MR principle, the evidence of this study did not support a 
stable significant causal association between thyroid cancer and IgAN. The 
results still need to be confirmed by future studies.
