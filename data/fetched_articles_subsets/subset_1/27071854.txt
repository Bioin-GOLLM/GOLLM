BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors 
in China and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been found to be highly 
related to GC carcinogenesis. Glypican-4 (GPC4), a member of the heparan 
sulphate proteoglycan family, plays an important role in the regulation of cell 
growth and differentiation. However, little is known about polymorphisms of GPC4 
gene and their associated susceptibility to GC, especially to Epstein-Barr 
virus-associated GC (EBVaGC). Here we studied the GPC4 polymorphism (rs1048369) 
in GC individuals, especially those with EBVaGC, and we explored an association 
between the GPC4 gene polymorphism (rs1048369) and susceptibility to EBVaGC and 
Epstein-Barr virus-negative GC (EBVnGC) in a population from Northern China.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The GPC4 gene polymorphism (rs1048369) was detected in 54 
cases of EBVaGC and 73 cases of EBVnGC using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
One hundred and seven peripheral blood samples from healthy individuals were 
also measured as a control group.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in both the genotype and allelic 
frequency of GPC4 gene (rs1048369) between the EBVaGC and EBVnGC patients. 
Meanwhile, the distribution of genotype and allelic frequency of GPC4 
(rs1048369) differed between EBVaGC and control groups. Distribution of the GPC4 
genotype also revealed differences between EBVnGC and control groups, no 
significant differences in the allelic frequency of the GPC4 gene (rs1048369) 
were observed. The frequency of the T allele in EBVaGC group was significantly 
higher than that in control and EBVnGC groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The GPC4 gene polymorphism and the allele of GPC4 are both 
associated with susceptibility to EBVaGC. The T allele of GPC4 may represent a 
risk factor for EBVaGC.
