Five point mutations were identified in unrelated Japanese Fabry disease 
hemizygotes: three new missense mutations, C142Y (425 G-->A), A156V (467 C-->T), 
and L166V (496 C-->G) in exon 3; one new splice site mutation at the 3' end of 
the consensus sequence in exon 4; one previously reported nonsense mutation, 
W44X (131 G-->A). C142Y expressed 50% of the normal enzyme protein in COS-1 
cells, but catalytic activity was not detected. Both A156V and L166V expressed 
significant amounts of residual enzyme activity (6.7% and 9.8%) and enzyme 
proteins (10% each), the latter were more thermolabile at neutral pH than at 
acid pH, in vitro.
