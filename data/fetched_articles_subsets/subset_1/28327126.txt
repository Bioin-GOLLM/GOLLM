BACKGROUND: Polygonum chinense Linn. is a common medicinal plant in Southeast 
Asia and has been used in traditional medicine in Vietnam. The plant contains 
phytochemicals with various biological properties; however, its antiviral effect 
has not yet been demonstrated. This study was aimed to evaluate the 
anti-influenza virus activity of crude extracts of P. chinense, to characterize 
antiviral metabolites therefrom and to investigate their mechanisms of antiviral 
action.
METHODS: The methanol (MeOH) extract and organic solvent layers of P. chinense 
were prepared by extraction and partition with relevant solvents. The ethyl 
acetate (EtOAc) layer showing antiviral activity was chromatographed repeatedly 
on SiO2 and Sephadex LH-20 columns to give eight pure metabolites. Their 
chemical structures were determined by NMR and MS spectral data. Anti-influenza 
virus activity of the eight metabolites against virus strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 
(H1N1, PR8), A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2, HK) and B/Lee/40 (Lee) was evaluated on the 
basis of cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque inhibition assays. Time-of-addition, 
confocal microscopy and neuraminidase inhibition assay were performed for 
mode-of-action studies of active ingredients.
RESULTS: The MeOH extract of P. chinense showed anti-influenza virus activity 
with EC50 values ranging from 38.4 to 55.5 μg/mL in a CPE inhibition assay. 
Among the eight pure metabolites isolated from P. chinense, ellagic acid (PC5), 
methyl gallate (PC7) and caffeic acid (PC8) significantly inhibited viral 
replication in a dose-dependent manner in both plaque inhibition and CPE 
inhibition assays with EC50 values ranging from 14.7 to 81.1 μg/mL and CC50 
values higher than 300 μg/mL. Mode-of-action studies suggested that PC5 and PC7 
suppress virus entry into or replication in cells, while PC8 targets influenza 
viral neuraminidase, even oseltamivir-resistant one.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that P. chinense and its metabolites 
possess effective anti-influenza virus activities. The botanical materials of P. 
chinense could be a promising multitargeted inhibitor of influenza A and B 
viruses and applied to development of a novel herbal medicine.
