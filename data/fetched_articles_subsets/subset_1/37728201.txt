Objectives: Immune checkpoint (ICP) expression in tumor cells could directly or 
indirectly affect the results of immunotherapy. ICP ligands on tumor cells 
usually bind their immune cell receptors to inhibit the activity, resulting in 
tumor immune escape. Thus, the purpose of this study was to ascertain the impact 
of various chemotherapeutic drugs on ICP expression in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with different pathological subtypes to provide a 
basis for the development of a superior regimen of chemotherapy combined with 
ICP blockade. Methods: Several first-line chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, 
carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and pemetrexed) were selected 
to treat different NSCLC cell lines (squamous carcinoma H1703, adenocarcinoma 
A549, and large cell cancer H460) for 72 hours, and then the changes in ICP 
expression in the tumor cells were observed through flow cytometry. Results: 
Cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel upregulated the expressions of programmed 
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2) in A549 
and H460 cell lines. Meanwhile, vinorelbine and pemetrexed upregulated PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 in H1703, A549, and H460 cell lines. Paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, 
and pemetrexed significantly upregulated the expressions of both galectin-9 and 
high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) in the A549 cell line. Cisplatin and 
paclitaxel significantly upregulated the expressions of major histocompatibility 
complex-II (MHC-II), galectin-3, α-synuclein, and fibrinogen-like protein 1 
(FGL1) in A549 and H460 cell lines. In addition, cisplatin and vinorelbine 
significantly upregulated the expressions of both CD155 and CD112 in the H460 
cell line. Vinorelbine upregulated MHC-I in all three cell lines. Conclusion: 
Chemotherapy agents have different effects on the expression of ICP ligands in 
tumor cells with different pathological types, and this may affect the efficacy 
of combined immunotherapy. These results provide a theoretical basis for further 
selection and optimization of the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
