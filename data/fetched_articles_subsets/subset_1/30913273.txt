Due to its ease of genetic manipulation and transparency, Caenorhabditis elegans 
(C. elegans) has become a preferred model system to study gene function by 
microscopy. The use of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused 
to proteins or targeting sequences of interest, further expanded upon the 
utility of C. elegans by labeling subcellular structures, which enables 
following their disposition during development or in the presence of genetic 
mutations. Fluorescent proteins with excitation and emission spectra different 
from that of GFP accelerated the use of multifluorophore imaging in real time. 
We have expanded the repertoire of fluorescent proteins for use in C. elegans by 
developing a codon-optimized version of Orange2 (CemOrange2). Proteins or 
targeting motifs fused to CemOrange2 were distinguishable from the more common 
fluorophores used in the nematode; such as GFP, YFP, and mKate2. We generated a 
panel of CemOrange2 fusion constructs, and confirmed they were targeted to their 
correct subcellular addresses by colocalization with independent markers. To 
demonstrate the potential usefulness of this new panel of fluorescent protein 
markers, we showed that CemOrange2 fusion proteins could be used to: 1) monitor 
biological pathways, 2) multiplex with other fluorescent proteins to determine 
colocalization and 3) gain phenotypic knowledge of a human ABCA3 orthologue, 
ABT-4, trafficking variant in the C. elegans model organism.
