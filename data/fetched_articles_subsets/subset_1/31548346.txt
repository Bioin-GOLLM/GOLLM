PURPOSE: The outgrowth of antigen-negative variants is a significant challenge 
for adoptive therapy with T cells that target a single specificity. Chimeric 
antigen receptors (CAR) are typically designed with one or two scFvs that impart 
antigen specificity fused to activation and costimulation domains of T-cell 
signaling molecules. We designed and evaluated the function of CARs with up to 
three specificities for overcoming tumor escape using Designed Ankyrin Repeat 
Proteins (DARPins) rather than scFvs for tumor recognition.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A monospecific CAR was designed with a DARPin binder (E01) 
specific for EGFR and compared with a CAR designed using an anti-EGFR scFv. CAR 
constructs in which DARPins specific for EGFR, EpCAM, and HER2 were linked 
together in a single CAR were then designed and optimized to achieve 
multispecific tumor recognition. The efficacy of CAR-T cells bearing a 
multispecific DARPin CAR for treating tumors with heterogeneous antigen 
expression was evaluated in vivo.
RESULTS: The monospecific anti-EGFR E01 DARPin conferred potent tumor regression 
against EGFR+ targets that was comparable with an anti-EGFR scFv CAR. Linking 
three separate DARPins in tandem was feasible and in an optimized format 
generated a single tumor recognition domain that targeted a mixture of 
heterogeneous tumor cells, each expressing a single antigen, and displayed 
synergistic activity when tumor cells expressed more than one target antigen.
CONCLUSIONS: DARPins can serve as high-affinity recognition motifs for CAR 
design, and their robust architecture enables linking of multiple binders 
against different antigens to achieve functional synergy and reduce antigen 
escape.
