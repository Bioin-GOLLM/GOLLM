Cholesterol is a vital lipid for cellular functions. It is necessary for 
membrane biogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. In addition to 
maintaining cell integrity and permeability, increasing evidence indicates a 
strict link between cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation, and hematological 
tumors. This makes cholesterol homeostasis an optimal therapeutic target for 
hematopoietic malignancies. Manipulating cholesterol homeostasis by either 
interfering with its synthesis or activating the reverse cholesterol transport 
via the engagement of liver X receptors affects the integrity of tumor cells 
both in vitro and in vivo. Cholesterol homeostasis has also been manipulated to 
restore antitumor immune responses in preclinical models. These observations 
have prompted clinical trials involving acute myeloid leukemia to test the 
combination of chemotherapy with drugs interfering with cholesterol synthesis 
(ie, statins). We review the role of cholesterol homeostasis in hematopoietic 
malignancies as well as in cells of the tumor microenvironment and discuss the 
potential use of lipid modulators for therapeutic purposes.
