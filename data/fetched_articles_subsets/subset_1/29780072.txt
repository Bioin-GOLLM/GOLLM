In this article, the authors review the literature related to long-term outcome 
of pediatric moyamoya disease, focusing on late cerebrovascular events and 
social outcome of pediatric patients once they reach adulthood. Late-onset de 
novo hemorrhage is rare but more serious than recurrence of ischemic stroke. 
Long-term follow-up data on Asian populations suggest that the incidence of de 
novo hemorrhage might increase at age 20 or later, even more than 10 years after 
bypass surgery. Social adaptation difficulty, possibly related to cognitive 
impairment caused by frontal ischemia, continues in 10-20% of patients after 
they reach adulthood, even if no significant disability is present in daily 
life. A treatment strategy aimed at improving long-term outcome and careful 
follow-up might be required.
