BACKGROUND: Persistence of latent, replication-competent provirus is the main 
impediment towards the cure of HIV infection. One of the critical questions 
concerning HIV latency is the role of integration site selection in HIV 
expression. Inhibition of the interaction between HIV integrase and its 
chromatin tethering cofactor LEDGF/p75 is known to reduce integration and to 
retarget residual provirus to regions resistant to reactivation. LEDGINs, small 
molecule inhibitors of the interaction between HIV integrase and LEDGF/p75, 
provide an interesting tool to study the underlying mechanisms. During early 
infection, LEDGINs block the interaction with LEDGF/p75 and allosterically 
inhibit the catalytic activity of IN (i.e. the early effect). When present 
during virus production, LEDGINs interfere with proper maturation due to 
enhanced IN oligomerization in the progeny virions (i.e. the late effect).
RESULTS: We studied the effect of LEDGINs present during virus production on the 
transcriptional state of the residual virus. Infection of cells with viruses 
produced in the presence of LEDGINs resulted in a residual reservoir that was 
refractory to activation. Integration of residual provirus was less favored near 
epigenetic markers associated with active transcription. However, integration 
near H3K36me3 and active genes, both targeted by LEDGF/p75, was not affected. 
Also in primary cells, LEDGIN treatment induced a reservoir resistant to 
activation due to a combined early and late effect.
CONCLUSION: LEDGINs present a research tool to study the link between 
integration and transcription, an essential question in retrovirology. LEDGIN 
treatment during virus production altered integration of residual provirus in a 
LEDGF/p75-independent manner, resulting in a reservoir that is refractory to 
activation.
