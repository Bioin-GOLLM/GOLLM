Replication stress (RS) is a cancer hallmark; chemotherapeutic drugs targeting 
RS are widely used as treatments for various cancers. To develop next-generation 
RS-inducing anticancer drugs, cell division cycle 7 (CDC7) has recently 
attracted attention as a target. We have developed an oral CDC7-selective 
inhibitor, TAK-931, as a candidate clinical anticancer drug. TAK-931 induced S 
phase delay and RS. TAK-931-induced RS caused mitotic aberrations through 
centrosome dysregulation and chromosome missegregation, resulting in 
irreversible antiproliferative effects in cancer cells. TAK-931 exhibited 
significant antiproliferative activity in preclinical animal models. 
Furthermore, in indication-seeking studies using large-scale cell panel data, 
TAK-931 exhibited higher antiproliferative activities in RAS-mutant versus 
RAS-wild-type cells; this finding was confirmed in pancreatic patient-derived 
xenografts. Comparison analysis of cell panel data also demonstrated a unique 
efficacy spectrum for TAK-931 compared with currently used chemotherapeutic 
drugs. Our findings help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for TAK-931 and 
identify potential target indications.
