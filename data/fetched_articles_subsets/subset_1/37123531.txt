Autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES) is linked to dominant negative 
mutations of the STAT3 protein whose molecular basis for dysfunction is unclear 
and presenting with a variety of clinical manifestations with only supportive 
treatment. To establish the relationship between the impact of STAT3 mutations 
in different domains and the severity of the clinical manifestations, 105 STAT3 
mutations were analyzed for their impact on protein stability, flexibility, 
function, and binding affinity using in Silico approaches. Our results showed 
that 73% of the studied mutations have an impact on the physicochemical 
properties of the protein, altering the stability, flexibility and function to 
varying degrees. In particular, mutations affecting the DNA binding domain (DBD) 
and the Src Homology 2 (SH2) have a significant impact on the protein structure 
and disrupt its interaction either with DNA or other STAT3 to form a 
heterodomain complex, leading to severe clinical phenotypes. Collectively, this 
study suggests that there is a close relationship between the domain involving 
the mutation, the degree of variation in the properties of the protein and the 
degree of loss of function ranging from partial loss to complete loss, 
explaining the variability of clinical manifestations between mild and severe.
