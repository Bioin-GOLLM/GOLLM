The importance of oligosaccharides in myriad biological processes is becoming 
increasingly clear. However, these carbohydrate-mediated processes are often 
challenging to dissect due to the often poor affinity, stability and selectivity 
of the oligosaccharides involved. To circumvent these issues, non-natural 
carbohydrates-carbohydrate mimics-are being designed as innovative tools to 
modify biomolecules of interest or to understand biological pathways using 
fluorescence microscopy, X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 
This review focuses on key examples of recently developed non-natural sugars to 
answer specific biological needs.
