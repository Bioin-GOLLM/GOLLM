BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is no doubt that the dramatic worldwide 
increase in obesity prevalence is due to changes in environmental factors. 
However, twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for the 
major part of the variation in body mass index (BMI) and other measures of body 
fatness within populations. Several recent studies suggest that the genetic 
effects on adiposity may be stronger when combined with presumed risk factors 
for obesity. We tested the hypothesis that a higher prevalence of obesity and 
overweight and a higher BMI mean is associated with a larger genetic variation 
in BMI.
METHODS: The data consisted of self-reported height and weight from two Danish 
twin surveys in 1994 and 2002. A total of 15,017 monozygotic and dizygotic twin 
pairs were divided into subgroups by year of birth (from 1931 through 1982) and 
sex. The genetic and environmental variance components of BMI were calculated 
for each subgroup using the classical twin design. Likewise, the prevalence of 
obesity, prevalence of overweight and the mean of the BMI distribution was 
calculated for each subgroup and tested as explanatory variables in a random 
effects meta-regression model with the square root of the additive genetic 
variance (equal to the standard deviation) as the dependent variable.
RESULTS: The size of additive genetic variation was positively and significantly 
associated with obesity prevalence (p = 0.001) and the mean of the BMI 
distribution (p = 0.015). The association with prevalence of overweight was 
positive but not statistically significant (p = 0.177).
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the genetic variation in BMI increases as 
the prevalence of obesity, prevalence of overweight and the BMI mean increases. 
The findings suggest that the genes related to body fatness are expressed more 
aggressively under the influence of an obesity-promoting environment.
