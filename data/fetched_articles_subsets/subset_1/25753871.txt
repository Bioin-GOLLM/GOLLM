OBJECTIVE: The -2518A/G polymorphism in the Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 
(MCP-1) gene may play an important role in regulating immunological reactions 
and may be associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). However, the 
relationship for the populations in Sichuan province of China remains unknown. 
The objective of the current study was to analysis that association.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 386 PTB patients and 398 controls were 
recruited. The genotypes were identified using PCR-RFLP and sequencing method. 
Data was analyzed using SPSS 11.0 software.
RESULTS: Significant association was found between the polymorphism and the risk 
of PTB: AG vs. AA: OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 0.98-1.92 and p = 0.06; GG vs. AA: OR = 
1.69, 95% CI = 1.14-2.50 and p = 0.009; AG+GG vs. AA: OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 
1.07-2.01 and p = 0.02; G vs. A: OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.08-1.60 and p = 0.007.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggested that the 2518A/G polymorphism in the 
MCP-1 gene was associated with risk of PTB in population of Sichuan province in 
China.
