The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Brazil was driven mainly by 
the spread of Gamma (P.1), a locally emerged variant of concern (VOC) that was 
first detected in early January 2021. This variant was estimated to be 
responsible for more than 96 per cent of cases reported between January and June 
2021, being associated with increased transmissibility and disease severity, a 
reduction in neutralization antibodies and effectiveness of treatments or 
vaccines, and diagnostic detection failure. Here we show that, following several 
importations predominantly from the USA, the Delta variant rapidly replaced 
Gamma after July 2021. However, in contrast to what was seen in other countries, 
the rapid spread of Delta did not lead to a large increase in the number of 
cases and deaths reported in Brazil. We suggest that this was likely due to the 
relatively successful early vaccination campaign coupled with natural immunity 
acquired following prior infection with Gamma. Our data reinforce reports of the 
increased transmissibility of the Delta variant and, considering the increasing 
concern due to the recently identified Omicron variant, argues for the necessity 
to strengthen genomic monitoring on a national level to quickly detect the 
emergence and spread of other VOCs that might threaten global health.
