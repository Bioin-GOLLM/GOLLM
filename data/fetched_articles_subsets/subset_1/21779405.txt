Group II chaperonins found in archaea and in eukaryotic cytosol mediate protein 
folding without a GroES-like cofactor. The function of the cofactor is 
substituted by the helical protrusion at the tip of the apical domain, which 
forms a built-in lid on the central cavity. Although many studies on the change 
in lid conformation coupled to the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides have 
been conducted, the molecular mechanism of lid closure remains poorly 
understood. Here, we performed a single-molecule polarization modulation to 
probe the rotation of the helical protrusion of a chaperonin from a 
hyperthermophilic archaeum, Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1. We detected 
approximately 35° rotation of the helical protrusion immediately after 
photorelease of ATP. The result suggests that the conformational change from the 
open lid to the closed lid state is responsible for the approximately 35° 
rotation of the helical protrusion.
