Previous studies in native tissues have produced conflicting data on the 
localization and metabolic fate of WT and deltaF508 cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane regulator (CFTR) in the lung. Combining immunocytochemical and 
biochemical studies utilizing new high-affinity CFTR mAbs with ion transport 
assays, we examined both 1) the cell type and region specific expression of CFTR 
in normal airways and 2) the metabolic fate of deltaF508 CFTR and associated ERM 
proteins in the cystic fibrosis lung. Studies of lungs from a large number of 
normal subjects revealed that WT CFTR protein localized to the apical membrane 
of ciliated cells within the superficial epithelium and gland ducts. In 
contrast, other cell types in the superficial, gland acinar, and alveolar 
epithelia expressed little WT CFTR protein. No deltaF508 CFTR mature protein or 
function could be detected in airway specimens freshly excised from a large 
number of deltaF508 homozygous subjects, despite an intact ERM complex. In sum, 
our data demonstrate that WT CFTR is predominantly expressed in ciliated cells, 
and deltaF508 CFTR pathogenesis in native tissues, like heterologous cells, 
reflects loss of normal protein processing.
