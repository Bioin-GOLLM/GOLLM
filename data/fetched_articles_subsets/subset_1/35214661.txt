Drug abuse is a common comorbidity in people infected with HIV. HIV-infected 
individuals who abuse drugs are a key population who frequently experience 
suboptimal outcomes along the HIV continuum of care. A modest proportion of 
HIV-infected individuals develop HIV-associated neurocognitive issues, the 
severity of which further increases with drug abuse. Moreover, the tendency of 
the virus to go into latency in certain cellular reservoirs again complicates 
the elimination of HIV and HIV-associated illnesses. Antiretroviral therapy 
(ART) successfully decreased the overall viral load in infected people, yet it 
does not effectively eliminate the virus from all latent reservoirs. Although 
ART increased the life expectancy of infected individuals, it showed 
inconsistent improvement in CNS functioning, thus decreasing the quality of 
life. Research efforts have been dedicated to identifying common mechanisms 
through which HIV and drug abuse lead to neurotoxicity and CNS dysfunction. 
Therefore, in order to develop an effective treatment regimen to treat 
neurocognitive and related symptoms in HIV-infected patients, it is crucial to 
understand the involved mechanisms of neurotoxicity. Eventually, those 
mechanisms could lead the way to design and develop novel therapeutic strategies 
addressing both CNS HIV reservoir and illicit drug use by HIV patients.
