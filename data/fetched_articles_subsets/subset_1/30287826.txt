The growth of the chemical industry has brought tremendous challenges to 
chemical sensing technology. Chemical sensors based on metamaterials have great 
potential because of their label-free and non-destructive characteristics. 
However, metamaterials applied in chemical sensing have mainly been investigated 
from the measurement of sample concentration or the determination of the 
dielectric properties at a fixed frequency. Here we present a metamaterial 
integrated microfluidic (MIM) sensor for the multi-band sensing for dielectric 
property of chemicals, which is promising for the identification of chemicals. 
The MIM sensor mainly consists of multiple pair of high sensitive symmetrical 
double split-ring resonators (DSRRs) and meandering microfluidic channels with a 
capacity of only 4 μL. A dielectric model has been innovatively established and 
experimentally verified to accurately estimate the complex permittivity and thus 
realize the multi-band sensing of dielectric property of chemicals. With the 
increase in the number of resonators in the sensor, a dielectric spectrum like 
curve could be obtained for more detailed dielectric information. This work 
delivers a miniaturized, reusable, label-free and non-destructive 
metamaterial-microfluidic solution and paves a way of the multi-band sensing for 
dielectric property of chemicals.
