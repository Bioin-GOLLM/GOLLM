To identify amino acid residues interacting with tyramine (TA) in the Bombyx 
mori TA (BmTA) receptor, several mutant receptors were expressed in HEK-293 
cells and examined for their abilities to bind TA and to attenuate 
forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in response to TA. The D134A BmTA receptor 
showed no specific [3H]TA binding and no TA-attenuation of cAMP levels. Although 
the S218A and S222A BmTA receptors showed no specific [3H]TA binding, they still 
had the ability to mediate the attenuation of cAMP levels in response to the 
high concentration (100 microM) of TA. The double mutation of Ser218 and Ser222 
to Ala, however, led to the loss of TA-attenuation of cAMP levels. The present 
study thus confirms that at least three amino acid residues play key roles in 
interaction with TA in the BmTA receptor.
