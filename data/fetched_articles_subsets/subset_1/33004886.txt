In vivo pharmacokinetics (PK) studies using mice and monkeys are the main 
approaches for evaluating and predicting the PK of antibodies, and there is a 
strong demand for methods that do not require animal experiments. In this work, 
we focused on quantitatively predicting the nonlinear PK of an antibody based on 
cell-based assays. An anti-mouse Fc gamma receptor IIB antibody was used as a 
model antibody. To determine the PK parameters related to nonspecific 
elimination in vivo, the plasma concentration profile at 100 mg/kg, at which 
target-specific clearance is saturated, was analyzed by a 2-compartment model. 
To estimate the parameters related to target-specific elimination, the 
Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximum elimination rate (Vmax) were 
determined by an uptake assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing 
the target receptor. Finally, the integration of all of these parameters 
permitted the PK to be predicted at doses ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg regardless 
of whether target-specific clearance was saturated or nonsaturated. The findings 
presented herein show that in vitro assays using target-expressing cells are 
useful tools for obtaining PK parameters and predicting PK profiles and, in some 
cases, eliminate the need for in vivo PK studies using experimental animals.
