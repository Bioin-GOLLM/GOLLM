Previous clinical studies have suggested that pachychoroid can induce macular 
neovascularization (MNV) to develop pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV) and that 
PNV can progress to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Recent studies 
based on the pachychoroid concept are now gradually revealing the true nature 
of, at least some part of, PCV. However, previous studies on PNV and/or PCV have 
used different frameworks for the classification of PNV, PCV, and neovascular 
age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). These have hampered the rapid overhaul 
of the understanding of PCV. Some investigators have assumed that all PCV is 
pachychoroid-driven whereas other investigators have classified PCV into 
"pachychoroid PCV" and "non-pachychoroid PCV". Furthermore, since there is no 
consensus as to whether PNV includes PCV, some studies have included PCV with 
PNV, while other studies have excluded PCV from PNV. To address these gaps, we 
summarize previous studies on PCV and pachychoroid. Even before the proposal of 
the pachychoroid concept, previous studies had suggested that PCV could be 
divided into two subtypes, of which one was characterized by pachychoroid 
features. Previous studies had also provided keys to understand relationship 
between PCV and PNV. We here recommend a refined conceptual framework for future 
studies on PNV, PCV, and nAMD. Considering the current inconsistent 
understanding of PCV, we should be cautious about using the term PCV until we 
understand the true nature of PCV.
