PURPOSE: Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a key signaling 
molecule regulating cell growth in some tumors, but its function and mechanism 
in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. Our study investigated the 
relationship between the expression of IFITM3 and HCC development. Material and 
Methods. IFITM3 expression was identified via multiple gene expression databases 
and investigated in HCC tissue samples. Then, PLC/PRF/5 cells were transfected 
with lentivirus to knock down and overexpress the expression of IFITM3. IFITM3 
expression, cell proliferation, and migration were detected by qRT-PCR, western 
blotting, QuantiGene Plex 2.0 assay, immunohistochemistry, CCK-8, and wound 
healing tests. RNA-seq technology identified the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as an 
IFITM3-related signaling pathway for investigation.
RESULTS: IFITM3 expression was higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent normal 
tissues, and the level of IFITM3 was higher in HCC tissues with low 
differentiation and metastatic potential than in those with high/medium 
differentiation and without metastatic potential. A higher RNA level of IFITM3 
was found in samples with IFITM3 rs12252-CC genotype rather than the TT 
genotype. Knockdown of IFITM3 in PLC/PRF/5 cells inhibited cell proliferation 
and migration, blocked the expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, 
and decreased the expression of vimentin. The results were opposite with the 
overexpression of IFITM3.
CONCLUSION: Upregulation of IFITM3 plays a role in the development of HCC. 
Possibly through regulating HCC cell proliferation and migration, these effects 
are associated with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Upregulation of IFITM3 
is also associated with the IFITM3 rs12252-CC genotype.
