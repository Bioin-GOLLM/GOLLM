The current era of advanced computing has allowed for the development and 
implementation of the field of radiomics. In pediatric neuro-oncology, radiomics 
has been applied in determination of tumor histology, identification of 
disseminated disease, prognostication, and molecular classification of tumors 
(ie, radiogenomics). The field also comes with many challenges, such as 
limitations in study sample sizes, class imbalance, generalizability of the 
methods, and data harmonization across imaging centers. The aim of this review 
paper is twofold: first, to summarize existing literature in radiomics of 
pediatric neuro-oncology; second, to distill the themes and challenges of the 
field and discuss future directions in both a clinical and technical context.
