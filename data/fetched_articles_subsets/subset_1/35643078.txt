Gene therapy offers great promise in addressing neuropathologies associated with 
the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS). However, genetic 
access remains difficult, reflecting the critical need for the development of 
effective and non-invasive gene delivery vectors across species. To that end, we 
evolved adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid in mice and validated 
two capsids, AAV-MaCPNS1 and AAV-MaCPNS2, across rodent species (mice and rats) 
and non-human primate (NHP) species (marmosets and rhesus macaques). Intravenous 
administration of either AAV efficiently transduced the PNS in rodents and both 
the PNS and CNS in NHPs. Furthermore, we used AAV-MaCPNS1 in mice to 
systemically deliver the following: (1) the neuronal sensor jGCaMP8s to record 
calcium signal dynamics in nodose ganglia and (2) the neuronal actuator DREADD 
to dorsal root ganglia to mediate pain. This conclusively demonstrates the 
translatability of these two systemic AAVs across four species and their 
functional utility through proof-of-concept studies in mice.
