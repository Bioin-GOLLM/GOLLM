We investigated the relationship among ERK signaling, histone modifications, and 
transcription factor activity, focusing on the ERK-regulated ternary complex 
factor family of SRF partner proteins. In MEFs, activation of ERK by TPA 
stimulation induced a common pattern of H3K9acS10ph, H4K16ac, H3K27ac, 
H3K9acK14ac, and H3K4me3 at hundreds of transcription start site (TSS) regions 
and remote regulatory sites. The magnitude of the increase in histone 
modification correlated well with changes in transcription. H3K9acS10ph preceded 
the other modifications. Most induced changes were TCF dependent, but 
TCF-independent TSSs exhibited the same hierarchy, indicating that it reflects 
gene activation per se. Studies with TCF Elk-1 mutants showed that TCF-dependent 
ERK-induced histone modifications required Elk-1 to be phosphorylated and 
competent to activate transcription. Analysis of direct TCF-SRF target genes and 
chromatin modifiers confirmed this and showed that H3S10ph required only Elk-1 
phosphorylation. Induction of histone modifications following ERK stimulation is 
thus directed by transcription factor activation and transcription.
