OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of napping with incident diabetes risk 
and glycaemic control in people with diabetes.
DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library 
were searched for studies published from database inception to 9 May 2023.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Observational studies reporting the relationship of 
napping with diabetes or glycaemic control in patients with diabetes in adult 
populations were included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently screened the 
literature, extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies. The 
results were reported as ORs and 95% CIs, which were pooled by using fixed and 
random effects models, and subgroup analyses were performed. The Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method was used to assess 
the quality of the evidence.
RESULTS: Forty studies were included in our review. Habitual napping was 
associated with an increased diabetes risk (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.27) and 
poor glycaemic control in patients with diabetes (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.55 to 2.73). 
Nap durations less than 30 min were unrelated to diabetes (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 
to 1.14). Nap durations of 30-60 min were associated with diabetes risk (OR 
1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17), but there were differences in the subgroup analysis 
results. Nap durations of more than 60 min significantly increased the risk of 
diabetes (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.44).
CONCLUSIONS: Napping is associated with increased diabetes risk and poor 
glycaemic control, and future research will need to confirm whether there are 
sex and regional differences. Nap durations of more than 60 min significantly 
increases the risk of diabetes, and the relationship between nap duration and 
glycaemic control in patients with diabetes needs to be further explored in the 
future.
