This study investigates the thermal decomposition initiation mechanisms and 
kinetics of poly(α-methylstyrene) (PαMS) under isothermal conditions, using 
molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF reactive force field. The 
unimolecular pyrolysis simulations show that the thermal decomposition of the 
PαMS molecule is initiated mainly by carbon-carbon backbone cleavage in two 
types at random points along the main chain that leads to different 
intermediates, and is accompanied by depolymerization reactions that lead to the 
formation of the final products. The time evolution of typical species in the 
process of PαMS thermal decomposition at various temperatures presents specific 
evolution profiles and shows a temperature-dependence effect. Isothermal 
decomposition kinetic analysis based on PαMS pyrolysis shows that the activation 
energy varies with the degree of conversion during the thermal decomposition 
processes, which infers that the decomposition process at different conversions 
may have different reaction mechanisms.
