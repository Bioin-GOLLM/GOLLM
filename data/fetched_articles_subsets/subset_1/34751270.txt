With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, there is urgent need to develop 
broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here, we isolate two V H H nanobodies (7A3 and 
8A2) from dromedary camels by phage display, which have high affinity for the 
receptor-binding domain (RBD) and broad neutralization activities against 
SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants. Cryo-EM complex structures reveal that 8A2 
binds the RBD in its up mode and 7A3 inhibits receptor binding by uniquely 
targeting a highly conserved and deeply buried site in the spike regardless of 
the RBD conformational state. 7A3 at a dose of â‰¥5 mg/kg efficiently protects 
K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from the lethal challenge of B.1.351 or B.1.617.2, 
suggesting that the nanobody has promising therapeutic potentials to curb the 
COVID-19 surge with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARY: Dromedary camel ( Camelus dromedarius ) V H H phage 
libraries were built for isolation of the nanobodies that broadly neutralize 
SARS-CoV-2 variants.
