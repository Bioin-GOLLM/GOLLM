Hb variants are structurally abnormal haemoglobins which can originate a wide 
range of phenotypes from clinically silent conditions to very severe disorders. 
In many cases, diagnosis is very difficult due to the instability of Hb mutants 
or the occurrence of misleading symptoms, such as cyanosis or hypoxia. Here we 
report the case of a young female with undiagnosed chronic haemolytic anaemia 
and low oxygen saturation in the absence of respiratory distress. High 
performance liquid chromatography showed the occurrence of an abnormal peak in 
the HbA2 region, which disappeared few days after blood sampling. Genetic 
analysis of both α genes revealed the -α3.7 deletion in heterozygous state and a 
novel mutation c.130 T > C leading to the substitution of Phenylalanine at codon 
43 with Leucine in the α1 gene. This substitution originated a new Hb variant, 
named Hb Vanvitelli, with a molecular mass of 15,092.2 ± 0.4 Da. Biochemical and 
laboratory tests described a hyper unstable Hb variant with altered oxygen 
affinity that was clinically significant only when co-inherited with genetic 
defects affecting the α2 locus. This case highlights the genetic complexity and 
diagnostic pitfalls of Hb variants, defined "experiments of nature" which can 
generate severe clinical conditions.
