Recent integrative epigenome analyses highlight the importance of functionally 
distinct chromatin states for accurate cell function. How these states are 
established and maintained is a matter of intense investigation. Here, we 
present evidence for DNA damage as an unexpected means to shape a protective 
chromatin environment at regions of recurrent replication stress (RS). Upon 
aberrant fork stalling, DNA damage signaling and concomitant H2AX 
phosphorylation coordinate the FACT-dependent deposition of macroH2A1.2, a 
histone variant that promotes DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). 
MacroH2A1.2, in turn, facilitates the accumulation of the tumor suppressor and 
HR effector BRCA1 at replication forks to protect from RS-induced DNA damage. 
Consequently, replicating primary cells steadily accrue macroH2A1.2 at fragile 
regions, whereas macroH2A1.2 loss in these cells triggers DNA damage 
signaling-dependent senescence, a hallmark of RS. Altogether, our findings 
demonstrate that recurrent DNA damage contributes to the chromatin landscape to 
ensure the epigenomic integrity of dividing cells.
