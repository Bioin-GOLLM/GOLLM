Networks of circadian timekeeping in the brain display marked daily changes in 
neuronal morphology. In Drosophila melanogaster, the striking daily structural 
remodeling of the dorsal medial termini of the small ventral lateral neurons has 
long been hypothesized to mediate endogenous circadian timekeeping. To test this 
model, we have specifically abrogated these sites of daily neuronal remodeling 
through the reprogramming of neural development and assessed the effects on 
circadian timekeeping and clock outputs. Remarkably, the loss of these sites has 
no measurable effects on endogenous circadian timekeeping or on any of the major 
output functions of the small ventral lateral neurons. Rather, their loss 
reduces sites of glutamatergic sensory neurotransmission that normally encodes 
naturalistic time cues from the environment. These results support an 
alternative model: structural plasticity in critical clock neurons is the basis 
for proper integration of light and temperature and gates sensory inputs into 
circadian clock neuron networks.
