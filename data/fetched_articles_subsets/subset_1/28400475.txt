Multiple myeloma remains treatable but incurable. Despite a growing 
armamentarium of effective agents, choice of therapy, especially in relapse, 
still relies almost exclusively on clinical acumen. We have developed a system, 
Ex vivo Mathematical Myeloma Advisor (EMMA), consisting of patient-specific 
mathematical models parameterized by an ex vivo assay that reverse engineers the 
intensity and heterogeneity of chemosensitivity of primary cells from multiple 
myeloma patients, allowing us to predict clinical response to up to 31 drugs 
within 5 days after bone marrow biopsy. From a cohort of 52 multiple myeloma 
patients, EMMA correctly classified 96% as responders/nonresponders and 
correctly classified 79% according to International Myeloma Working Group 
stratification of level of response. We also observed a significant correlation 
between predicted and actual tumor burden measurements (Pearson r = 0.5658, P < 
0.0001). Preliminary estimates indicate that, among the patients enrolled in 
this study, 60% were treated with at least one ineffective agent from their 
therapy combination regimen, whereas 30% would have responded better if treated 
with another available drug or combination. Two in silico clinical trials with 
experimental agents ricolinostat and venetoclax, in a cohort of 19 multiple 
myeloma patient samples, yielded consistent results with recent phase I/II 
trials, suggesting that EMMA is a feasible platform for estimating clinical 
efficacy of drugs and inclusion criteria screening. This unique platform, 
specifically designed to predict therapeutic response in multiple myeloma 
patients within a clinically actionable time frame, has shown high predictive 
accuracy in patients treated with combinations of different classes of drugs. 
The accuracy, reproducibility, short turnaround time, and high-throughput 
potential of this platform demonstrate EMMA's promise as a decision support 
system for therapeutic management of multiple myeloma. Cancer Res; 77(12);
