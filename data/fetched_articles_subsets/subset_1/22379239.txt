STUDY OBJECTIVES: EEG slow waves are the hallmark of deep NREM sleep and may 
reflect the restorative functions of sleep. Evidence suggests that increased 
sleep slow waves after sleep deprivation reflect plastic synaptic processes, and 
that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is causally involved in their 
homeostatic regulation. The functional Val66Met polymorphism of the gene 
encoding pro-BDNF causes impaired activity-dependent secretion of mature BDNF 
protein. We investigated whether this polymorphism contributes to the pronounced 
inter-individual variation in sleep slow wave activity (SWA) in humans.
SETTING: Sleep laboratory in temporal isolation unit.
PARTICIPANTS: Eleven heterozygous Met allele carriers and 11 individually sex- 
and age-matched Val/Val homozygotes.
INTERVENTIONS: Forty hours prolonged wakefulness.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Cognitive performance, subjective state, and waking 
and sleep EEG in baseline and after sleep deprivation were studied. Val/Val 
homozygotes showed better response accuracy than Met allele carriers on a verbal 
2-back working memory task. This difference did not reflect genotype-dependent 
differences in sleepiness, well-being, or sustained attention. In baseline and 
recovery nights, deep stage 4 sleep and NREM sleep intensity as quantified by 
EEG SWA (0.75-4.5 Hz) were higher in Val/Val compared to Val/Met genotype. 
Similar to sleep deprivation, the difference was most pronounced in the first 
NREM sleep episode. By contrast, increased activity in higher EEG frequencies (> 
6 Hz) in wakefulness and REM sleep was distinct from the effects of prolonged 
wakefulness.
CONCLUSION: BDNF contributes to the regulation of sleep slow wave oscillations, 
suggesting that genetically determined variation in neuronal plasticity 
modulates NREM sleep intensity in humans.
