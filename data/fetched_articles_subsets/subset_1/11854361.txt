The low frequency of self-peptide-specific T cells in the human preimmune 
repertoire has so far precluded their direct evaluation. Here, we report an 
unexpected high frequency of T cells specific for the self-antigen 
Melan-A/MART-1 in CD8 single-positive thymocytes from human histocompatibility 
leukocyte antigen-A2 healthy individuals, which is maintained in the peripheral 
blood of newborns and adults. Postthymic replicative history of 
Melan-A/MART-1-specific CD8 T cells was independently assessed by quantifying T 
cell receptor excision circles and telomere length ex vivo. We provide direct 
evidence that the large T cell pool specific for the self-antigen Melan-A/MART-1 
is mostly generated by thymic output of a high number of precursors. This 
represents the only known naive self-peptide-specific T cell repertoire directly 
accessible in humans.
