Lafora's disease (LD; OMIM 254780) is an autosomal recessive form of progressive 
myoclonus epilepsy characterized by seizures and cumulative neurological 
deterioration. Onset occurs during late childhood and usually results in death 
within ten years of the first symptoms. With few exceptions, patients follow a 
homogeneous clinical course despite the existence of genetic heterogeneity. 
Biopsy of various tissues, including brain, revealed characteristic polyglucosan 
inclusions called Lafora bodies, which suggested LD might be a generalized 
storage disease. Using a positional cloning approach, we have identified at 
chromosome 6q24 a novel gene, EPM2A, that encodes a protein with consensus amino 
acid sequence indicative of a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). mRNA 
transcripts representing alternatively spliced forms of EPM2A were found in 
every tissue examined, including brain. Six distinct DNA sequence variations in 
EPM2A in nine families, and one homozygous microdeletion in another family, have 
been found to cosegregate with LD. These mutations are predicted to cause 
deleterious effects in the putative protein product, named laforin, resulting in 
LD.
