Limited digestion of guinea pig myelin basic protein and its carboxy-terminal 
fragment (residues 89-169) with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease.

Diebler GE, Nomura K, Kies MW.

Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease has been reported to have a strict specificity 
for cleavage of the Glu-X bond in ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9). With myelin 
basic protein and one of its major peptic fragments (residues 89-169) as 
substrates, selective cleavage of Asp(32)-Thr(33), Asp(37)-Ser(38), and 
Glu(118-Gly(119) bonds was observed, as well as the unusual cleavage of the 
Gly(127)-Gly(128) bond. The Asp-Glu and Glu-Asn bonds in the sequence of 
Gln-Asp-Glu-Asn-Pro(81-84) were resistant to V8 protease attack. The following 
peptides were identified as products of limited cleavage of basic protein by V8 
protease: (1-32), (1-37), (33-169), (38-169), (33-118), (38-118), (33-127), 
(38-127), (119-169), and (128-169). Cleavage of the peptic peptide (89-169) 
yielded fragments (89-118), (89-127), (119-169), and (128-169). All peptides 
were identified by amino acid analysis, as well as NH2- and COOH-terminal 
analyses. Time course studies with basic protein showed that V8 protease 
initially attacked the bonds between Asp(32) and Thr(33) and Asp(37) and 
Ser(38). With peptide (89-169) the initial cleavage was between Glu(118) and 
Gly(119). Peptides (89-118) and (89-127) were encephalitogenic in the Lewis rat. 
The activity of these peptides in the rat confirms the presence of a minor 
encephalitogenic site in guinea pig basic protein. Peptide (89-127) was 
encephalitogenic in the guinea pig, as expected, because it contains the intact 
encephalitogenic site. V8 protease digestion of basic protein yields some 
interesting new fragments, not previously available for biologic studies.
