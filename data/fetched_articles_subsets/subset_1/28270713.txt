OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility of promoting safe Ramadan 
fasting through diabetes self-management education (DSME) and to determine the 
effect of such education on hypoglycemic episodes.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study included subjects attending Ramadan 
reinforcement sessions for participants in the Educational Program for People 
with Diabetes (EPPWD) at the Ain-Shams University Diabetes Center in Cairo, 
Egypt. The DSME sessions started 2-3 weeks before Ramadan and included one 
experimental fasting day during the first week and one during the second week. 
Participants' A1C and serum fructosamine levels were measured before and after 
Ramadan, and they completed weekly self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) logs.
RESULTS: Among 21 participants who were intending to fast for Ramadan, 14 
completed the program. Their mean A1C was 6.7 ± 1.6%, and SMBG results showed a 
statistically nonsignificant difference in mean blood glucose levels before and 
after Ramadan (123.84 ± 39.96 and 123.84 ± 25.92 mg/dL, respectively; P >0.05). 
Serum fructosamine after Ramadan declined by 10% from pre-Ramadan levels. The 
mean number of hypoglycemic events before Ramadan was 3 ± 1.04, which declined 
to 1.4 ± 0.5 during Ramadan. Differences between group 1 (those without 
hypoglycemia, n = 8) and group 2 (those with hypoglycemia, n = 6) were 
nonsignificant for all variables, including A1C.
CONCLUSION: Ramadan fasting is feasible for people with diabetes who are on a 
multiple daily injection insulin regimen and participate in the EPPWD. The 
number of hypoglycemic events per month declined with the attainment of DSME.
