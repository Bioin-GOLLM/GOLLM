Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces cytopathic effects in the form of hepatocytes 
apoptosis thought to be resulted from the interaction between viral proteins and 
host factors. Using pathway specific PCR array, we identified 9 
apoptosis-related genes that are dysregulated during HCV infection, of which the 
BH3-only pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, BIK, was consistently up-regulated 
at the mRNA and protein levels. Depletion of BIK protected host cells from 
HCV-induced caspase-3/7 activation but not the inhibitory effect of HCV on cell 
viability. Furthermore, viral RNA replication and release were significantly 
suppressed in BIK-depleted cells and over-expression of the RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase, NS5B, was able to induce BIK expression. Immunofluorescence and 
co-immunoprecipitation assays showed co-localization and interaction of BIK and 
NS5B, suggesting that BIK may be interacting with the HCV replication complex 
through NS5B. These results imply that BIK is essential for HCV replication and 
that NS5B is able to induce BIK expression.
