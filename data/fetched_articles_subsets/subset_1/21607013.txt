Scopolamine, an anticholinergic, is an attractive amnesic agent for discerning 
the action of candidate antiamnesic drugs. Bacopa monniera Linn (Syn. Brahmi) is 
one such antiamnesic agent that is frequently used in the ancient Indian medical 
system. We have earlier reported the reversal of diazepam-induced amnesia with 
B. monniera. In this study we wanted to test if scopolamine-induced impairment 
of spatial memory can also be ameliorated by B. monniera using water maze mouse 
model. The objective of study was to study the effect of B. monniera on 
scopolamine-induced amnesia. We employed Morris water maze scale to test the 
amnesic effect of scopolamine and its reversal by B. monniera. Rotarod test was 
conducted to screen muscle coordination activity of mice. Scopolamine 
significantly impaired the acquisition and retrieval of memory producing both 
anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Bacopa monniera extract was able to reverse 
both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. We propose that B. monniera's effects 
on cholinergic system may be helpful for developing alternative therapeutic 
approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
