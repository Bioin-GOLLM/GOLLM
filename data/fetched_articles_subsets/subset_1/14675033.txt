BACKGROUND: Gitel syndrome is an inherited tubular disorder characterized by 
metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia of renal origin and 
hypocalciuria. The majority of patients with Gitelman syndrome carry 
inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene encoding the sodium-chloride 
cotransporter located in the distal convoluted tubule. The purpose of this study 
was to investigate the underlying mutation in Gitelman syndrome patients of 
Gypsy race from different geographic origin.
METHODS: Twenty Gypsy patients with clinical and biochemical features of 
Gitelman syndrome were investigated by mutational analysis. The patients 
belonged to 12 unrelated Gypsy families living in four different European 
countries. The parents and unaffected siblings of each patient, as well as the 
DNA of a population of 200 healthy control patients, were also analyzed.
RESULTS: All patients were homozygous for the same splice site mutation, guanine 
to thymine in the first position of intron 9 of SLC12A3 gene. This mutation was 
not found in the control population. Parents were heterozygous for the mutation. 
Despite sharing a common mutation, the clinical manifestations of the syndrome 
in the patients varied from lack of symptoms in six children to severe growth 
retardation in four.
CONCLUSION: Demonstration of a novel point mutation within the SLC12A3 gene in 
our cohort of Gypsy families with Gitelman syndrome is highly suggestive of a 
founder effect. This finding will facilitate the identification of the genetic 
defect in further cases of Gitelman syndrome among the Gypsy population. Our 
study represents the largest series ever published of patients with Gitelman 
syndrome having the same underlying mutation, and supports the lack of 
correlation between genotype and clinical phenotype in this disease.
