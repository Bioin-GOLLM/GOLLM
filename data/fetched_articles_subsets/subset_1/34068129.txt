Liposomes have become successful nanostructured systems used in clinical 
practices. These vesicles are able to carry important drug loadings with 
noteworthy stability. The aim of this work was to develop iron oxide-loaded 
stealth liposomes as a prospective alternative for the treatment of lung cancer. 
In this study, citric acid iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs-Ac) were synthesized 
and encapsulated in stealth liposomes. Their cytotoxicity and selectivity 
against lung tumor cells were assessed. Stealth liposomal vesicles, with 
relevant content of IONPs-Ac, named ferri-liposomes (SL-IONPs-Ac), were produced 
with an average size of 200 nm. They displayed important cytotoxicity in a human 
lung cancer cells model (A549 cells), even at low concentrations, whereas free 
IONPs-Ac displayed adequate biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the treatment at the 
same concentration of ferri-liposomes against HEK-293 cells, a normal human cell 
lineage, was not significantly cytotoxic, revealing a probable lung tumor 
selectiveness of the fabricated formulation. Furthermore, from the flow 
cytometry studies, it was possible to infer that ferri-liposomes were able to 
induce A549 tumor cells death through apoptosis/ferroptosis processes, evidenced 
by a significant reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential.
