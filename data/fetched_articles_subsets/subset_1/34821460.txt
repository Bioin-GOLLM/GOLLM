We describe clinical details, including novel findings, of two further children 
with the newly defined TLK2-related disorder. One patient was recruited to the 
Deciphering Developmental Delay (DDD) Study to identify underlying etiology of 
global developmental delay. The other was detected on whole-exome sequencing as 
part of second line investigations following normal microarray. Both patients 
were found to have de novo heterozygous pathogenic TLK2 variants. A novel c.6del 
p.(Glu3Lysfs*) loss-of-function frameshift variant was found in Patient 1. A 
c.1121+1G>A splice-donor variant was detected in Patient 2. TLK2-related 
neurodevelopmental disorder is a specific syndrome that has been recently 
described. Global developmental delay, behavioral problems, gastrointestinal 
disorders, and typical facial dysmorphism are common features. Neuropsychiatric 
disorders, ophthalmic, musculoskeletal and cranial abnormalities, as well as 
short stature, have also all been described. The novel findings we describe 
include sleep disturbance, nondifferentiation of lateral semi-circular canals 
(where asymmetric semi-circular canals were a feature in the previous cohort), 
vesico-ureteric reflux, and bilateral periauricular skin tags. Here, we report a 
novel TLK2 variant and previously undescribed features of TLK2-related disorder, 
to expand the clinical phenotype and provide further genotype-phenotype 
correlation.
