Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy with pleiotropic effects on multiple 
tissues, including the kidney. Here we have compared renal differentiation of 
iPS cells from healthy and BBS donors. High content image analysis of 
WT1-expressing kidney progenitors showed that cell proliferation, 
differentiation and cell shape were similar in healthy, BBS1, BBS2, and BBS10 
mutant lines. We then examined three patient lines with BBS10 mutations in a 3D 
kidney organoid system. The line with the most deleterious mutation, with low 
BBS10 expression, expressed kidney marker genes but failed to generate 3D 
organoids. The other two patient lines expressed near normal levels of BBS10 
mRNA and generated multiple kidney lineages within organoids when examined at 
day 20 of organoid differentiation. However, on prolonged culture (day 27) the 
proximal tubule compartment degenerated. Introducing wild type BBS10 into the 
most severely affected patient line restored organoid formation, whereas 
CRISPR-mediated generation of a truncating BBS10 mutation in a healthy line 
resulted in failure to generate organoids. Our findings provide a basis for 
further mechanistic studies of the role of BBS10 in the kidney.
