CONTEXT: Information on the prevalence of pathogenic BRCA1 mutation carriers in 
racial/ethnic minority populations is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate BRCA1 carrier prevalence in Hispanic, African American, 
and Asian American female breast cancer patients compared with non-Hispanic 
white patients with and without Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We estimated race/ethnicity-specific 
prevalence of BRCA1 in a population-based, multiethnic series of female breast 
cancer patients younger than 65 years at diagnosis who were enrolled at the 
Northern California site of the Breast Cancer Family Registry during the period 
1996-2005. Race/ethnicity and religious ancestry were based on self-report. 
Weighted estimates of prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were based 
on Horvitz-Thompson estimating equations.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimates of BRCA1 prevalence.
RESULTS: Estimates of BRCA1 prevalence were 3.5% (95% CI, 2.1%-5.8%) in Hispanic 
patients (n = 393), 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.6%) in African American patients (n = 
341), and 0.5% (95% CI, 0.1%-2.0%) in Asian American patients (n = 444), 
compared with 8.3% (95% CI, 3.1%-20.1%) in Ashkenazi Jewish patients (n = 41) 
and 2.2% (95% CI, 0.7%-6.9%) in other non-Hispanic white patients (n = 508). 
Prevalence was particularly high in young (<35 years) African American patients 
(5/30 patients [16.7%]; 95% CI, 7.1%-34.3%). 185delAG was the most common 
mutation in Hispanics, found in 5 of 21 carriers (24%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among African American, Asian American, and Hispanic patients in 
the Northern California Breast Cancer Family Registry, the prevalence of BRCA1 
mutation carriers was highest in Hispanics and lowest in Asian Americans. The 
higher carrier prevalence in Hispanics may reflect the presence of unrecognized 
Jewish ancestry in this population.
