Protein aggregation is a process in which identical proteins self-associate into 
imperfectly ordered macroscopic entities. Such aggregates are generally 
classified as amorphous, lacking any long-range order, or highly ordered 
fibrils. Protein fibrils can be composed of native globular molecules, such as 
the hemoglobin molecules in sickle-cell fibrils, or can be reorganized 
beta-sheet-rich aggregates, termed amyloid-like fibrils. Amyloid fibrils are 
associated with several pathological conditions in humans, including Alzheimer 
disease and diabetes type II. We studied the structure of bacterial inclusion 
bodies, which have been believed to belong to the amorphous class of aggregates. 
We demonstrate that all three in vivo-derived inclusion bodies studied are 
amyloid-like and comprised of amino-acid sequence-specific cross-beta structure. 
These findings suggest that inclusion bodies are structured, that amyloid 
formation is an omnipresent process both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and that 
amino acid sequences evolve to avoid the amyloid conformation.
