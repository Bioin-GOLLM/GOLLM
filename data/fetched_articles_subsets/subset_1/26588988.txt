p53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor and a major barrier against cancer. We now 
report that silencing of the Hippo pathway tumor suppressors LATS1 and LATS2 in 
nontransformed mammary epithelial cells reduces p53 phosphorylation and 
increases its association with the p52 NF-κB subunit. Moreover, it partly shifts 
p53's conformation and transcriptional output toward a state resembling 
cancer-associated p53 mutants and endows p53 with the ability to promote cell 
migration. Notably, LATS1 and LATS2 are frequently down-regulated in breast 
cancer; we propose that such down-regulation might benefit cancer by converting 
p53 from a tumor suppressor into a tumor facilitator.
