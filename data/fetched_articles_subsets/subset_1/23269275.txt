The mechanisms through which the metastasis suppressor gene BRMS1 functions are 
poorly understood. Herein, we report the identification of a previously 
undescribed E3 ligase function of BRMS1 on the histone acetyltransferase p300. 
BRMS1 induces polyubiquitination of p300, resulting in its proteasome-mediated 
degradation. We identify BRMS1 as the first eukaryote structural mimic of the 
bacterial IpaH E3 ligase family and establish that the evolutionarily conserved 
CXD motif located in BRMS1 is responsible for its E3 ligase function. Mutation 
of this E3 ligase motif not only abolishes BRMS1-induced p300 polyubiquitination 
and degradation, but importantly, dramatically reduces the metastasis suppressor 
function of BRMS1 in both in vitro and in vivo models of lung cancer metastasis.
