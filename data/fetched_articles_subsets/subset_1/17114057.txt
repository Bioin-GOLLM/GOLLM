Release of ubiquitin-charged Cdc34 from the SCF ubiquitin ligase followed by 
diffusion-driven collision with substrate has been proposed to underlie 
ubiquitination of the canonical SCF substrate Sic1. Cdc34 F72V, reported to be 
defective in dissociation from SCF, served as key validation. Here, we test 
predictions of this "hit-and-run" hypothesis. We find that Cdc34 F72V is 
generally defective in SCF-mediated activation but, contrary to expectation, 
does not compete with wild-type Cdc34 in vitro or in vivo and can fulfill the 
physiological role of Cdc34 with only moderate delay in Sic1 turnover. Whereas a 
hit-and-run mechanism might explain how Cdc34 can transfer ubiquitin to the ends 
of growing ubiquitin chains on SCF-bound substrates, molecular modeling suggests 
that an E2 docked to SCF can do so without dissociating. We propose that 
interactions between Cdc34 approximately Ub and SCF directly activate ubiquitin 
transfer within a substrate-SCF-Cdc34 approximately Ub ternary complex.
