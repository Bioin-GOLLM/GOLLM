Aberrant activation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) has 
been implicated in tumorigenesis and radioiodine resistance of thyroid cancer, 
indicating its therapeutic potential. In the present study, we confirmed the 
association between PDGFRA and radioiodine resistance in thyroid cancer using 
bioinformatics analysis and constructed a prediction model of PDGFRA inhibitors 
using machine learning and molecular docking approaches. We then performed a 
virtual screening of a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) derived compound 
library and successfully identified 4',5,7-trimethoxyflavone as a potential 
PDGFRA inhibitor. Further characterization revealed a significant inhibitory 
effect of 4',5,7-trimethoxyflavone on PDGFRA-MAPK pathway activation, and that 
it could upregulate expression of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as well as 
improve radioiodine uptake capacity of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer 
(RAIR-TC), suggesting it a potential drug lead for the development of new 
RAIR-TC therapy.
