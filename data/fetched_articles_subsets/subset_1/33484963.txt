Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) is a monogenic disease of ammonia 
metabolism in hepatocytes. Severe disease is frequently treated by orthotopic 
liver transplantation. An attractive approach is the correction of a patient's 
own cells to regenerate the liver with gene-repaired hepatocytes. This study 
investigates the efficacy and safety of ex vivo correction of primary human 
hepatocytes. Hepatocytes isolated from an OTCD patient were genetically 
corrected ex vivo, through the deletion of a mutant intronic splicing site 
achieving editing efficiencies >60% and the restoration of the urea cycle 
in vitro. The corrected hepatocytes were transplanted into the liver of FRGN 
mice and repopulated to high levels (>80%). Animals transplanted and liver 
repopulated with genetically edited patient hepatocytes displayed normal 
ammonia, enhanced clearance of an ammonia challenge and OTC enzyme activity, as 
well as lower urinary orotic acid when compared to mice repopulated with 
unedited patient hepatocytes. Gene expression was shown to be similar between 
mice transplanted with unedited or edited patient hepatocytes. Finally, a 
genome-wide screening by performing CIRCLE-seq and deep sequencing of >70 
potential off-targets revealed no unspecific editing. Overall analysis of 
disease phenotype, gene expression, and possible off-target editing indicated 
that the gene editing of a severe genetic liver disease was safe and effective.
