In neurons, specific mRNAs are transported in a translationally repressed manner 
along dendrites or axons by transport ribonucleic-protein complexes called RNA 
granules. ZBP1 is one RNA binding protein present in transport RNPs, where it 
transports and represses the translation of cotransported mRNAs, including 
β-actin mRNA. The release of β-actin mRNA from ZBP1 and its subsequent 
translation depends on the phosphorylation of ZBP1 by Src kinase, but little is 
known about how this process is regulated. Here we demonstrate that the 
ribosomal-associated protein RACK1, another substrate of Src, binds the β-actin 
mRNA/ZBP1 complex on ribosomes and contributes to the release of β-actin mRNA 
from ZBP1 and to its translation. We identify the Src binding and 
phosphorylation site Y246 on RACK1 as the critical site for the binding to the 
β-actin mRNA/ZBP1 complex. Based on these results we propose RACK1 as a 
ribosomal scaffold protein for specific mRNA-RBP complexes to tightly regulate 
the translation of specific mRNAs.
