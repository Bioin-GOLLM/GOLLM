OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a novel anti-HIF-1α intrabody to decrease 
gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer patients.
METHODS: Surface plasmon resonance and glutathione S-transferase pull-down 
assays were conducted to identify the binding affinity and specificity of 
anti-HIF-1α VHH212 [a single-domain antibody (nanobody)]. Molecular dynamics 
simulation was used to determine the protein-protein interactions between 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and VHH212. The real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and Western blot analyses were performed to identify the 
expressions of HIF-1α and VEGF-A in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines. 
The efficiency of the VHH212 nanobody in inhibiting the HIF-1 signaling pathway 
was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. Finally, a PANC-1 xenograft 
model was developed to evaluate the anti-tumor efficiency of combined treatment. 
Immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted to detect the expressions of HIF-1α 
and VEGF-A in tumor tissues.
RESULTS: VHH212 was stably expressed in tumor cells with low cytotoxicity, high 
affinity, specific subcellular localization, and neutralization of HIF-1α in the 
cytoplasm or nucleus. The binding affinity between VHH212 and the HIF-1α PAS-B 
domain was 42.7 nM. Intrabody competitive inhibition of the HIF-1α heterodimer 
with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator was used to inhibit the 
HIF-1/VEGF pathway in vitro. Compared with single agent gemcitabine, 
co-treatment with gemcitabine and a VHH212-encoding adenovirus significantly 
suppressed tumor growth in the xenograft model with 80.44% tumor inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an anti-HIF-1α nanobody and showed the function of 
VHH212 in a preclinical murine model of PANC-1 pancreatic cancer. The 
combination of VHH212 and gemcitabine significantly inhibited tumor development. 
These results suggested that combined use of anti-HIF-1α nanobodies with 
first-line treatment may in the future be an effective treatment for pancreatic 
cancer.
