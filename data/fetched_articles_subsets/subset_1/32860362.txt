BACKGROUND: Adenosine receptors (AR) have emerged as competent and innovative 
nondopaminergic targets for the development of potential drug candidates and 
thus constitute an effective and safer treatment approach for Parkinson's 
disease (PD). Xanthine derivatives are considered as potential candidates for 
the treatment Parkinson's disease due to their potent A2A AR antagonistic 
properties.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the work are to study the impact of substituting 
N7-position of 8-m/pchloropropoxyphenylxanthine structure on in vitro binding 
affinity of compounds with various AR subtypes, in vivo antiparkinsonian 
activity and binding modes of newly synthesized xanthines with A2A AR in 
molecular docking studies.
METHODS: Several new 7-substituted 8-m/p-chloropropoxyphenylxanthine analogues 
have been prepared. Adenosine receptor binding assays were performed to study 
the binding interactions with various subtypes and perphenazine induced rat 
catatonia model was used for antiparkinsonian activity. Molecular docking 
studies were performed using Schrödinger molecular modeling interface.
RESULTS: 8-para-substituted xanthine 9b bearing an N7-propyl substituent 
displayed the highest affinity towards A2A AR (Ki = 0.75 μM) with moderate 
selectivity versus other AR subtypes. 7-Propargyl analogue 9d produced 
significantly long-lasting antiparkinsonian effects and also produced potent and 
selective binding affinity towards A2A AR. In silico docking studies further 
highlighted the crucial structural components required to develop xanthine 
derived potential A2A AR ligands as antiparkinsonian agents.
CONCLUSION: A new series of 7-substituted 8-m/p-chloropropoxyphenylxanthines 
having good affinity for A2A AR and potent antiparkinsonian activity has been 
developed.
