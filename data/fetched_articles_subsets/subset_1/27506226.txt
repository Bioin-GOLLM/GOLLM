MOTIVATION: Biomedical researchers often search through massive catalogues of 
literature to look for potential relationships between genes and diseases. Given 
the rapid growth of biomedical literature, automatic relation extraction, a 
crucial technology in biomedical literature mining, has shown great potential to 
support research of gene-related diseases. Existing work in this field has 
produced datasets that are limited both in scale and accuracy.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a reliable and efficient framework that takes 
large biomedical literature repositories as inputs, identifies credible 
relationships between diseases and genes, and presents possible genes related to 
a given disease and possible diseases related to a given gene. The framework 
incorporates name entity recognition (NER), which identifies occurrences of 
genes and diseases in texts, association detection whereby we extract and 
evaluate features from gene-disease pairs, and ranking algorithms that estimate 
how closely the pairs are related. The F1-score of the NER phase is 0.87, which 
is higher than existing studies. The association detection phase takes 
drastically less time than previous work while maintaining a comparable F1-score 
of 0.86. The end-to-end result achieves a 0.259 F1-score for the top 50 genes 
associated with a disease, which performs better than previous work. In 
addition, we released a web service for public use of the dataset.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation of the proposed algorithms
