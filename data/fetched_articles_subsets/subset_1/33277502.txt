The nuclear lamina-a meshwork of intermediate filaments termed lamins-is 
primarily responsible for the mechanical stability of the nucleus in 
multicellular organisms. However, structural-mechanical characterization of 
lamin filaments assembled in situ remains elusive. Here, we apply an integrative 
approach combining atomic force microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, network 
analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to directly measure the mechanical 
response of single lamin filaments in three-dimensional meshwork. Endogenous 
lamin filaments portray non-Hookean behavior - they deform reversibly at a few 
hundred picoNewtons and stiffen at nanoNewton forces. The filaments are 
extensible, strong and tough similar to natural silk and superior to the 
synthetic polymer Kevlar®. Graph theory analysis shows that the lamin meshwork 
is not a random arrangement of filaments but exhibits small-world properties. 
Our results suggest that lamin filaments arrange to form an emergent meshwork 
whose topology dictates the mechanical properties of individual filaments. The 
quantitative insights imply a role of meshwork topology in laminopathies.
