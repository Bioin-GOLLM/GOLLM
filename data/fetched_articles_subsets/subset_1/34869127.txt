Background: FERM domain-containing protein 4A (FRMD4A) is a scaffolding protein 
previously proposed to be critical in the regulation of cell polarity in neurons 
and implicated in human intellectual development. Case Presentation: We report a 
case of a 3-year-old boy with corpus callosum anomaly, relative macrocephaly, 
ataxia, and unexplained global developmental delay. Here, compound heterozygous 
missense mutations in the FRMD4A gene [c.1830G>A, p.(Met610Ile) and c.2973G>C, 
p.(Gln991His)] were identified in the proband, and subsequent familial 
segregation showed that each parent had transmitted a mutation. Conclusions: Our 
results have confirmed the associations of mutations in the FRMD4A gene with 
intellectual development and indicated that for patients with unexplained global 
developmental delay, the FRMD4A gene should be included in the analysis of whole 
exome sequencing data, which can contribute to the identification of more 
patients affected by this severe phenotypic spectrum.
