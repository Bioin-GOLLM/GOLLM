Viral respiratory tract infections have significantly impacted global health as 
well as socio-economic growth. Respiratory viruses such as the influenza virus, 
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recent SARS-CoV-2 infection 
(COVID-19) typically infect the upper respiratory tract by entry through the 
respiratory mucosa before reaching the lower respiratory tract, resulting in 
respiratory disease. Generally, vaccination is the primary method in preventing 
virus pathogenicity and it has been shown to remarkably reduce the burden of 
various infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the efficacy of conventional vaccines 
may be hindered by certain limitations, prompting the need to develop novel 
vaccine delivery vehicles to immunize against various strains of respiratory 
viruses and to mitigate the risk of a pandemic. In this review, we provide an 
insight into how polymer-based nanoparticles can be integrated with the 
development of vaccines to effectively enhance immune responses for combating 
viral respiratory tract infections.
