Most forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are caused by dominant mutations in either 
of the two genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, that encode the pro alpha 1(I) and pro 
alpha 2(I) chains of type I collagen, respectively. However, a severe, autosomal 
recessive form of OI type III with a comparatively high frequency has been 
recognised in the black populations of southern Africa. We preformed linkage 
analyses in eight OI type III families using RFLPs associated with the COL1A1 
and COL1A2 loci to determine whether mutations in the genes for type I collagen 
were responsible for this form of OI. Recombination between the OI phenotype and 
polymorphic markers at both loci was shown in three of the eight families 
investigated. The combined lod scores for the eight families were -10.6 for 
COL1A1 and -11.2 for COL1A2. Further, we examined the type I procollagen 
produced by skin fibroblast cultures derived from 15 affected and 12 unaffected 
subjects from the above eight families plus one further family. We found no 
evidence for defects in the synthesis, structure, secretion, or 
post-translational modification of the chains of type I procollagen produced by 
any of the family members. These results suggest that mutations within or near 
the type I collagen structural genes are not responsible for this form of OI.
