Most applications of nanotechnology in cancer have focused on systemic delivery 
of cytotoxic drugs. Systemic delivery relies on accumulation of nanoparticles in 
a target tissue through enhanced permeability of leaky vasculature and retention 
effect of poor lymphatic drainage to increase the therapeutic index. Systemic 
delivery is limited, however, by toxicity and difficulty crossing natural 
obstructions, like the blood spine barrier. Magnetic drug targeting (MDT) is a 
new technique to reach tumors of the central nervous system. Here, we describe a 
novel therapeutic approach for high-grade intramedullary spinal cord tumors 
using magnetic nanoparticles (MNP). Using biocompatible compounds to form a 
superparamagnetic carrier and magnetism as a physical stimulus, MNP-conjugated 
with doxorubicin were successfully localized to a xenografted tumor in a rat 
model. This study demonstrates proof-of-concept that MDT may provide a novel 
technique for effective, concentrated delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to 
intramedullary spinal cord tumors without the toxicity of systemic 
administration.
