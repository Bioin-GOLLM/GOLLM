Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common metastatic skin 
cancer. The prognosis of patients with metastatic cSCC is poor emphasizing the 
need for new therapies. We have previously reported that the activation of 
Ras/MEK/ERK1/2 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad2 signaling in 
transformed keratinocytes and cSCC cells leads to increased accumulation of 
laminin-332 and accelerated invasion. Here, we show that the next-generation 
B-Raf inhibitor PLX8394 blocks TGF-β signaling in ras-transformed metastatic 
epidermal keratinocytes (RT3 cells) harboring wild-type B-Raf and hyperactive 
Ras. PLX8394 decreased phosphorylation of TGF-β receptor II and Smad2, as well 
as p38 activity, MMP-1 and MMP-13 synthesis, and laminin-332 accumulation. 
PLX8394 significantly inhibited the growth of human cSCC tumors and in vivo 
collagen degradation in xenograft model. In conclusion, our data indicate that 
PLX8394 inhibits several serine-threonine kinases in malignantly transformed 
human keratinocytes and cSCC cells and inhibits cSCC invasion and tumor growth 
in vitro and in vivo. We identify PLX8394 as a potential therapeutic compound 
for advanced human cSCC.
