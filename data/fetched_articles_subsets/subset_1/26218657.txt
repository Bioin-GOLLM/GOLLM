ADAMTS9 is a metalloprotease that cleaves components of the extracellular matrix 
and is also implicated in transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the 
Golgi. It has been reported that an ADAMTS9 gene variant is associated with type 
2 diabetes. The underlying pathology of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance 
and beta-cell dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ADAMTS9 
function in beta cells and peripheral tissues are unknown. We show that loss of 
C. elegans GON-1, an ADAMTS9 homolog, alters lifespan and dauer formation. GON-1 
loss impairs secretion of proteins such as insulin orthologs and TGF-beta, and 
additionally impacts insulin/IGF-1 signaling in peripheral tissues. The function 
of the GON domain, but not the protease domain, is essential for normal lifespan 
and dauer formation in these scenarios. We conclude that the GON domain is 
critical for ADAMTS9/GON-1 function across species, which should help the 
understanding of type 2 diabetes in humans.
