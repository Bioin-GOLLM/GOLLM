GPR21 is a class-A orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and a potential 
therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders. This 
receptor shows high basal activity in coupling to multiple G proteins in the 
absence of any known endogenous agonist or synthetic ligand. Here, we present 
the structures of ligand-free human GPR21 bound to heterotrimeric miniGs and 
miniG15 proteins, respectively. We identified an agonist-like motif in 
extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) that occupies the orthosteric pocket and promotes 
receptor activation. A side pocket that may be employed as a new ligand binding 
site was also uncovered. Remarkably, G protein binding is accommodated by a 
flexible cytoplasmic portion of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) which adopts little 
or undetectable outward movement. These findings will enable the design of 
modulators for GPR21 for understanding its signal transduction and exploring 
opportunity for deorphanization.
