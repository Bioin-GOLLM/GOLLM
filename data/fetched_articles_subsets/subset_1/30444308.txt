Astrovirus VA1/HMO-C (VA1) is the representative genotype of mamastrovirus 9, a 
species of the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viral family, Astroviridae. 
Astroviruses have been traditionally considered pathogens of the 
gastrointestinal tract but they have been recently associated with neurological 
diseases in humans, cattle, mink, sheep, and pigs. VA1 is the astrovirus 
genotype most commonly identified from human cases of meningoencephalitis and 
has been recently propagated in cell culture. VA1 can now be used as a model 
system to study pathogenesis of the neurological diseases associated with 
astrovirus infection. In this article, we describe two fundamental assays to 
quantify replication and propagation of VA1, a quantitative reverse 
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure viral RNA and a 50% tissue culture 
infectious dose (TCID50 ) assay to measure infectious viral particles. © 2018 by
