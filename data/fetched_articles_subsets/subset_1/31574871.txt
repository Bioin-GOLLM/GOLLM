RATIONALE: Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare inherited marrow disorder, 
characterized by erythrocyte aplasia and is associated with congenital anomalies 
and a susceptibility to cancer. Although congenital abnormalities have been 
observed in ∼50% of DBA patients, the occurrence of an associated congenital 
diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has rarely been reported.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-month-old male child was referred to our pediatric 
hematology-oncology outpatient clinic with anemic appearance. He presented to us 
with recurrent anemia, short stature, and developmental delay.
DIAGNOSIS: On bone marrow examination, only erythropoietic cells were markedly 
decreased in number, whereas other cell lines were unaffected. An abdominal 
computed tomography scan revealed a Bochdalek type of CDH. A genetic analysis 
revealed heterozygous mutation of RPS19; therefore, he was diagnosed as having 
DBA with CDH.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient received an initial packed red blood cell 
transfusion, followed by an administration of oral prednisone.
OUTCOMES: The patient is maintained on oral prednisone administered at a dose of 
0.3 mg/kg every alternate day and has since a hemoglobin level of >9.0 g/dL 
without further RBC transfusions.
LESSONS: We learned that a Bochdalek type of CDH can manifest in a DBA patient 
with RPS19 gene mutation. Therefore, patients diagnosed with the latter disorder 
should also be screened for an early detection of potential CDHs.
