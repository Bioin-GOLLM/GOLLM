The scratch assay is an in vitro assay that allows for high-throughput 
quantification of wound closure by keratinocytes and fibroblasts with relative 
ease. However, this assay is amenable to experimental variables, which can 
result in false-positive and false-negative data, making the interpretation of 
such data difficult. Also, data variability decreases the sensitivity of the 
scratch assay. Here, we identify important sources of data variation in the 
scratch assay and provide rational mitigation strategies that enable robust and 
highly reproducible quantification of scratch width and area, and ultimately the 
scratch closure rates. By eliminating these sources of variability, the 
sensitivity of the scratch assay is enhanced, thereby allowing for 
identification of dependent variables with wide-ranging impacts on wound closure 
in a robust and standardized manner.
