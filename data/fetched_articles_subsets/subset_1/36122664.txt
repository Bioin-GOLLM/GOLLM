ASK1-JNK signaling promotes mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis, but 
the bridge between JNK and apoptosis is not fully understood. PUMA induces 
apoptosis through BAX/BAK. Our previous study suggests a therapeutic potential 
of PUMA for ovarian cancer. However, whether and how PUMA activates ASK1 remains 
unclear. Here, we found for the first time that PUMA activated ASK1 by 
dissociating thioredoxin (TRX) from ASK1, however, it neither interacted with 
ASK1 nor TRX. Furthermore, PUMA overexpression caused ROS release from 
mitochondrial. H2O2 significantly impaired the interaction of ASK1 with TRX, 
whereas ROS scavenger NAC effectively abrogated the H2O2 effect, partly rescued 
PUMA-interfered interaction of ASK1 with TRX, and also abolished ASK1 
phosphorylation. Interestingly, PUMA could not impair the association of ASK1 
with TRX-C32S or TRX-C35S, two TRX mutants which are no longer oxidized in 
response to ROS. We further showed that PUMA activated ASK1-JNK axis to 
phosphorylate BCL-2 and BCL-XL, further augmenting apoptosis of ovarian cancer 
cells. In vivo, PUMA adenovirus combined with paclitaxel significantly inhibited 
intrinsically cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer growth, and caused 
phosphorylation of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. Our results from human ovarian cancer TMA 
chips also revealed a positive correlation between PUMA expression and the 
phosphorylation of BCL-2 and BCL-XL. More importantly, all patients had no 
distal metastasis, implying a possibly clinical significance. Collectively, our 
results reveal a new pro-apoptotic signal amplification mechanism for PUMA by 
which PUMA overexpression first induces ROS-mediated dissociation of TRX from 
ASK1, and then causes JNK activation-triggering BCL-2/BCL-XL phosphorylation, 
ultimately augmenting apoptosis in ovarian cancer.
