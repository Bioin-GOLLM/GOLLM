Type-1 diabetes (T1D) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease, and there are 
pathogenetic differences between young- and adult-onset T1D patients. We 
hypothesized that the expressions of genes involved in costimulatory immune 
system pathways in peripheral blood are differently regulated in young- and 
adult-onset T1D. Study group I consisted of 80 children, adolescents, and young 
adults (age range 1.4-21.4 y; 31 controls and 49 T1D patients). Study group II 
consisted of 48 adults (age range 22.0-78.4 y; 30 controls and 18 T1D patients). 
The mRNA expression levels of CD86, CD28, CD25, CD226, CD40, BTLA, GITR, PDCD1, 
FoxP3, TGF-β, ICOS, sCTLA4, flCTLA4, and CD80 were measured in peripheral blood. 
Genetic polymorphisms (HLA haplotypes; rs231806, rs231775, and rs3087243 
in CTLA4; rs763361 in CD226; and rs706778 in CD25) and T1D-associated 
autoantibodies were analyzed. In group I, there was significantly lower 
expression of CD226 in T1D patients than in the controls. In group II, there 
were significantly higher expression levels of CD86 and TGF-β in T1D patients 
than in the controls. In the T1D patients in group I, the upregulated CD80 
expression correlated with the expression of both CTLA4 splice variants (sCTLA4 
and flCTLA4). In contrast, in group II, upregulated CD86 correlated with TGF-β 
and CD25. In group I, the inhibitory CD80-CTLA4 pathway was activated, whereas, 
in group II, the activation CD86-CD28 pathway and TGF-β production were 
activated. These results emphasize the differences between young-onset and 
adult-onset T1D in the regulation of costimulatory pathways. These differences 
should be considered when developing novel treatments for T1D.
