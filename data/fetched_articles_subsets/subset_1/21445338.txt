BACKGROUND: In The Netherlands, caesarean sections (CSs) are rarely combined 
with tubal occlusion (TO), partly because discussing CS/TO near delivery is 
considered unethical and earlier hypothetical counselling--i.e. suppose you 
happen to need a CS--is rare. This results in more unintended pregnancies and is 
inconsistent with informed choice. We explored whether TO should indeed not be 
made routinely available to eligible women.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A questionnaire was mailed to 515 Para ≥2 who underwent in 
the past ≥1 CS. 498 (96.7%) responded. They were on average 35.3 years old, had 
2.5 children, had undergone 1.6 CSs, and 3.3 years had passed since their index 
delivery, either a CS (393) or vaginal birth (105) after a previous CS. 87% of 
the 498 believed that pregnant mothers with ≥1 children should be routinely 
counselled about CS/TO. Indeed, 58% and 85% respectively, thought women/couples 
expecting their second or third child should still be given the TO option days 
before delivery, if omitted earlier. Counselled women, 138/498 (27.8%), were far 
more often satisfied than those without CS/TO option. 33/393 had a CS/TO. None 
indicated regret in the questionnaire. Another 119 also would have elected a 
CS/TO if given that option. Therefore, 152 (38.7%) of 393 Para ≥2 had or would 
have liked a concurrent TO. 118/119 wrote they still regretted missing this 
opportunity. The exception's husband had had a vasectomy. 100/119 were good TO 
candidates: they were ≥28 years when they delivered an apparently healthy baby 
of ≥37 weeks. The current contraceptive use of these 100 suggests that this 
group will have at least 8 unintended pregnancies before age 50.
CONCLUSION: The experiences and opinions of previous potential candidates for a 
CS/TO do not support the reluctance of Dutch obstetricians to counsel pregnant 
Para ≥1 about the TO option for a (potential) CS.
