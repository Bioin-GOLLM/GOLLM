Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for intestinal homeostasis and is 
aberrantly activated in most colorectal cancers (CRC) through mutation of the 
tumor suppressor Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC). APC is an essential component 
of a cytoplasmic protein complex that targets β-catenin for destruction. 
Following Wnt ligand presentation, this complex is inhibited. However, a role 
for APC in this inhibition has not been shown. Here, we utilized Wnt3a-beads to 
locally activate Wnt co-receptors. In response, the endogenous β-catenin 
destruction complex reoriented toward the local Wnt cue in CRC cells with 
full-length APC, but not if APC was truncated or depleted. Non-transformed human 
colon epithelial cells displayed similar Wnt-induced destruction complex 
localization which appeared to be dependent on APC and less so on Axin. Our 
results expand the current model of Wnt/β-catenin signaling such that in 
response to Wnt, the β-catenin destruction complex: (1) maintains composition 
and binding to β-catenin, (2) moves toward the plasma membrane, and (3) requires 
full-length APC for this relocalization.
