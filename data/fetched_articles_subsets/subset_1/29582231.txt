Wild birds are natural hosts and reservoirs for influenza A viruses. However, 
many species, such as many waterfowl, are asymptomatic when infected and so 
facilitate the generation of viral genetic diversity. Mutations of key genes 
affect the replicability, pathogenicity, transmissibility, and antiviral 
resistance of influenza A viruses. In this study, we isolated avian influenza 
(AI) viruses from wild bird fecal samples and analyzed changes in amino acids 
over time and geographic region to monitor the biological change of the AI 
virus. Between 2014 and 2016, we collected 38,921 fresh fecal samples from major 
wild bird habitats located throughout Korea and isolated 123 AI viruses. We 
subsequently selected 22 amino acid sites to analyze for changes. These sites 
included ten sites associated with replication, ten sites associated with 
pathogenicity, three sites associated with transmission, and seven sites 
associated with antiviral resistance. We found substitution rates of 71.7% at 
the C38Y amino acid site within the polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) gene, 66.7% 
at the D222G site within the hemagglutinin (HA) 1 gene, and 75.6% at the A184 
site within the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. Alterations of the PB1, HA1, and NP 
genes are closely associated with increased pathogenicity in chickens and 
mammals. The remaining sites of interest exhibited few modifications. In this 
study, we confirmed that AI viruses circulating among wild birds in Korea 
consistently exhibit modifications at amino acid sites linked with replication 
and pathogenicity.
