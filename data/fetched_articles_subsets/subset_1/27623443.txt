While 9% of human pathogenic variants have an established effect on pre-mRNA 
splicing, it is suspected that an additional 20% of otherwise classified 
variants also affect splicing. Aberrant splicing includes disruption of splice 
sites or regulatory elements, or creation or strengthening of cryptic splice 
sites. For the majority of variants, it is poorly understood to what extent and 
how these may affect splicing. We have identified cryptic splicing in an 
unbiased manner. Three types of cryptic splicing were analyzed in the context of 
pathogenic variants in the acid α-glucosidase gene causing Pompe disease. These 
involved newly formed deep intronic or exonic cryptic splice sites, and a 
natural cryptic splice that was utilized due to weakening of a canonical splice 
site. Antisense oligonucleotides that targeted the identified cryptic splice 
sites repressed cryptic splicing at the expense of canonical splicing in all 
three cases, as shown by reverse-transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction analysis and by enhancement of acid α-glucosidase enzymatic activity. 
This argues for a competition model for available splice sites, including intact 
or weakened canonical sites and natural or newly formed cryptic sites. The 
pipeline described here can detect cryptic splicing and correct canonical 
splicing using antisense oligonucleotides to restore the gene defect.
