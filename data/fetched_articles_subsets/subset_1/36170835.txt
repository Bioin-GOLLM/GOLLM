Dysregulation of alternative splicing in prostate cancer is linked to 
transcriptional programs activated by AR, ERG, FOXA1, and MYC. Here, we show 
that FOXA1 functions as the primary orchestrator of alternative splicing 
dysregulation across 500 primary and metastatic prostate cancer transcriptomes. 
We demonstrate that FOXA1 binds to the regulatory regions of splicing-related 
genes, including HNRNPK and SRSF1. By controlling trans-acting factor 
expression, FOXA1 exploits an "exon definition" mechanism calibrating 
alternative splicing toward dominant isoform production. This regulation 
especially impacts splicing factors themselves and leads to a reduction of 
nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-targeted isoforms. Inclusion of the 
NMD-determinant FLNA exon 30 by FOXA1-controlled oncogene SRSF1 promotes cell 
growth in vitro and predicts disease recurrence. Overall, we report a role for 
FOXA1 in rewiring the alternative splicing landscape in prostate cancer through 
a cascade of events from chromatin access, to splicing factor regulation, and, 
finally, to alternative splicing of exons influencing patient survival.
