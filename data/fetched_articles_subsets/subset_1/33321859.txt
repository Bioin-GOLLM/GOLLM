Castration is among the most common management procedures performed in the dairy 
and beef cattle industries and is mainly performed by surgery or elastic 
banding. Despite the various benefits of castration, all methods produce pain 
and distress. Castration by banding is simple, inexpensive, produces fewer 
complications, and can be performed in a high-throughput manner. Because 
lidocaine, a local anesthetic, can be delivered to trauma sites topically, we 
have formulated lidocaine-loaded castration bands (LLBs) to deliver local pain 
relief to calves during banded castration. The initial lidocaine content of 
three band types developed was between 80 and 200 mg per band. The transfer 
kinetics of lidocaine into tissue was determined in vitro, indicating a rapid 
release for the first 30 min, followed by a slow release lasting at least 48 h. 
Furthermore, the lidocaine delivery and pain mitigation effects of these LLBs 
were compared to standard lidocaine injections in vivo. Field studies indicated 
that LLBs performed at least as well as lidocaine injections for short-term 
lidocaine delivery into tissues and pain mitigation. Moreover, LLBs 
significantly outperformed lidocaine injections for long-term delivery and pain 
mitigation. The concentrations of lidocaine in the LLB-treated tissue samples 
were generally in the range of 0.5-3.5 mg of lidocaine per gram of tissue and 
were overall highest after 6 h. Lidocaine-loaded elastration bands deliver 
therapeutic quantities of lidocaine into scrotal tissues over a period of at 
least seven days in cattle. This approach would provide long-term pain 
mitigation to the animals and, by avoiding surgery or the administration of 
injections, would also decrease the time and handling costs for the producer.
