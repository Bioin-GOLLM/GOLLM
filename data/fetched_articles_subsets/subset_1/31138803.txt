Despite the conserved essential function of centromeres, centromeric DNA itself 
is not conserved. The histone-H3 variant, CENP-A, is the epigenetic mark that 
specifies centromere identity. Paradoxically, CENP-A normally assembles on 
particular sequences at specific genomic locations. To gain insight into the 
specification of complex centromeres, here we take an evolutionary approach, 
fully assembling genomes and centromeres of related fission yeasts. Centromere 
domain organization, but not sequence, is conserved between Schizosaccharomyces 
pombe, S. octosporus and S. cryophilus with a central CENP-ACnp1 domain flanked 
by heterochromatic outer-repeat regions. Conserved syntenic clusters of tRNA 
genes and 5S rRNA genes occur across the centromeres of S. octosporus and S. 
cryophilus, suggesting conserved function. Interestingly, nonhomologous 
centromere central-core sequences from S. octosporus and S. cryophilus are 
recognized in S. pombe, resulting in cross-species establishment of CENP-ACnp1 
chromatin and functional kinetochores. Therefore, despite the lack of sequence 
conservation, Schizosaccharomyces centromere DNA possesses intrinsic conserved 
properties that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin.
