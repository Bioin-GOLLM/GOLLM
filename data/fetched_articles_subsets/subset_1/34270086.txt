Jawad syndrome is a multiple congenital anomaly and intellectual disability 
syndrome with mutation in RBBP8 reported only in two families. Here, we report 
on two new families from Pakistan and identified a previously reported variant 
in RBBP8, NM_002894.3:c.1808-1809delTA. We could show that this mutation impairs 
splicing resulting in two different abnormal transcripts. Finally, we could 
verify a shared haplotype among all four families and estimate the founder event 
to have occurred some 24 generations ago.
