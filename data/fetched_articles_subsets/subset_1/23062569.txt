Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the fifth-leading cause of death worldwide and 
contributes to leading causes of death, cancer and cardiovascular disease, 
including CAD, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and other vascular disease. 
While glycemic management remains a cornerstone of DM care, the co-management of 
hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular risk reduction, and prevention of 
long-term consequences associated with DM are now well recognized as essential 
to improve long-term survival. Clinical trial evidence substantiates the 
importance of glycemic control, low-density cholesterol-lowering therapy, blood 
pressure lowering, control of albuminuria, and comprehensive approaches 
targeting multiple risk factors to reduce cardiovascular risk. This article 
presents a review of the role of DM in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and 
cardiac dysfunction, recent evidence on the degree of glycemic control and 
mortality, and available evidence for a multifaceted approach to improve 
long-term outcomes for patients.
