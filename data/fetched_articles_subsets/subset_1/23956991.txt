In the last years, several lines of evidence showed how metabolic factors may 
influence the natural history of patients with chronic hepatitis C. Chronic HCV 
infection is able to perturb the metabolic homeostasis of the host, in a context 
of complex interactions where pre-existent metabolic status and genetic 
background play an important role, allowing us to state that HCV infection is a 
systemic disease. In this review, we discuss the most recent lines of evidence 
on the main metabolic factors that are known to be associated with CHC, namely, 
insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, steatosis, visceral obesity, 
atherosclerosis, vitamin D, menopause, fructose and coffee intake, lipoproteins, 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase status, and hyperuricaemia. In particular, 
we focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the correlation between 
HCV infection and metabolic disorders, the impact of metabolic factors on the 
progression of liver and non-liver-related diseases, and, on the contrary, the 
possible influence of chronic HCV infection on metabolic features. In this 
setting, the importance of a multifaceted evaluation of CHC patients and a 
prompt correction of modifiable metabolic risk factors should be emphasized.
