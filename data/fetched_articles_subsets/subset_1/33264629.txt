Local cell contraction pulses play important roles in tissue and cell 
morphogenesis. Here, we improve a chemo-optogenetic approach and apply it to 
investigate the signal network that generates these pulses. We use these 
measurements to derive and parameterize a system of ordinary differential 
equations describing temporal signal network dynamics. Bifurcation analysis and 
numerical simulations predict a strong dependence of oscillatory system dynamics 
on the concentration of GEF-H1, an Lbc-type RhoGEF, which mediates the positive 
feedback amplification of Rho activity. This prediction is confirmed 
experimentally via optogenetic tuning of the effective GEF-H1 concentration in 
individual living cells. Numerical simulations show that pulse amplitude is most 
sensitive to external inputs into the myosin component at low GEF-H1 
concentrations and that the spatial pulse width is dependent on GEF-H1 
diffusion. Our study offers a theoretical framework to explain the emergence of 
local cell contraction pulses and their modulation by biochemical and mechanical 
signals.
