Two RNA fragments linked by means of a 2',5' phosphodiester bridge (2' hydroxyl 
of one fragment connected to the 5' hydroxyl of the other) constitute a class of 
nucleic acids known as 2'-5' branched RNAs (bRNAs). In this report we show that 
bRNA analogues containing 2'-5' phosphoramidate linkages (bN-RNAs) inhibit the 
lariat debranching enzyme, a 2',5'-phosphodiesterase that has recently been 
implicated in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. bN-RNAs were 
efficiently generated using automated solid-phase synthesis and suitably 
protected branchpoint building blocks. Two orthogonally removable groups, namely 
the 4-monomethoxytrityl (MMTr) group and the fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl (Fmoc) 
groups, were evaluated as protecting groups of the 2' amino functionality. The 
2'-N-Fmoc methodology was found to successfully produce bN-RNAs on solid-phase 
oligonucleotide synthesis. The synthesized bN-RNAs resisted hydrolysis by the 
lariat debranching enzyme (Dbr1) and, in addition, were shown to attenuate the 
Dbr1-mediated hydrolysis of native bRNA.
