We present recent advances in the genetics of recurrent vertigo, including 
familial episodic ataxias, migraneous vertigo, bilateral vestibular hypofunction 
and Meniere's disease.Although several vestibular disorders are more common 
within families, the genetics of vestibulopathies is largely not known. Genetic 
loci and clinical features of familial episodic ataxias have been defined in 
linkage disequilibrium studies with mutations in neuronal genes KCNA1 and 
CACNA1A. Migrainous vertigo is a clinical disorder with a high comorbidity 
within families much more common in females with overlapping features with 
episodic ataxia and migraine. Bilateral vestibular hypofunction is a 
heterogeneous clinical group defined by episodes of vertigo leading to 
progressive loss of vestibular function which also can include migraine. 
Meniere's disease is a clinical syndrome characterized by spontaneous episodes 
of recurrent vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness 
and familial Meniere's disease in around 10-20% of cases. An international 
collaborative effort to define the clinical phenotype and recruiting patients 
with migrainous vertigo and Meniere's disease is ongoing for genome-wide 
association studies.
