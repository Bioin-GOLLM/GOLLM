The negative side effects of neurosurgical resection of the lower third of the 
primary motor cortex (M1) are often described as relatively mild. However, 
detailed descriptions of how these resections affect neurocognitive function, 
speech, mental health and quality of life (QoL) are sparse. In the present 
study, seven patients with suspected lower-grade glioma (WHO II-III) in the 
inferior M1 were assessed for facial motor function, cognitive function, anxiety 
and QoL before and after awake surgical resections. The main finding was that 
after surgery, six of the seven patients experienced a mild facial motor 
dysfunction, mainly affecting the mouth, tongue and throat. At the group level, 
we were also able to observe a significant postoperative decline in maximum 
verbal speed, whereas no negative effects on measures of word production (i.e., 
verbal fluency) were seen. Self-reported QoL data suggest that some patients 
experienced increased social isolation postoperatively but do not lend support 
to the interpretation that this was caused by direct neurological side effects 
of the surgery. The results appear to support the general notion that awake 
surgery in the lower M1 can be performed safely and with postoperative deficits 
that are most often perceived by the patient as tolerable.
