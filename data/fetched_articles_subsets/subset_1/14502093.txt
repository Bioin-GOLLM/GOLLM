Adenosine is a neuromodulator acting mainly via inhibitory A1 and facilitatory 
A2A receptors. Whole tissue PCR also identified adenosine A3 receptors in the 
brain and A3 receptor agonists affect CNS neuronal responses and viability. 
However, recent reports failed to detect A3 receptor expression in CNS neurons 
and showed that A3 receptor agonists can bind and activate A1 receptors. We now 
present evidence for the presence of A3 receptor mRNA in CNS neurons using 
single cell PCR analysis of laser dissected hippocampal neurons. Western blot 
analysis showed that A3 receptors are present in rat hippocampal nerve terminal 
membranes. This indicates that A3 receptors are present in CNS neurons in the 
hippocampus.
