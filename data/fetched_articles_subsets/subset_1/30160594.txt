Increasing evidence suggests that patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) demonstrate abnormalities in the bone marrow (BM) and hematopoietic 
progenitor cells. In addition, PAH is associated with myeloproliferative 
diseases. We have previously demonstrated that low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
is a potent stimulus for the development of PAH in the context of a genetic PAH 
mouse model of BMPR2 dysfunction. We hypothesized that the hematopoietic 
progenitor cells might be driving disease in this model. To test this 
hypothesis, we performed adoptive transfer of BM between wild-type (Ctrl) and 
heterozygous Bmpr2 null (Mut) mice. Sixteen weeks after BM reconstitution, mice 
were exposed to low-dose chronic LPS (0.5â€‰mg/kg three times a week for six 
weeks). Mice underwent right heart catheterization and tissues were removed for 
histology. After chronic LPS dosing, Ctrl mice in receipt of Mut BM developed 
PAH, whereas Mut mice receiving Ctrl BM were protected from PAH. BM histology 
demonstrated an increase in megakaryocytes and there was an increase in 
circulating platelets in Ctrl mice receiving Mut BM. These findings demonstrate 
that the hematopoietic stem cell compartment is involved in the susceptibility 
to PAH in the Mut mouse. The results raise the possibility that hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation might be a potential treatment strategy in genetic 
forms of PAH.
