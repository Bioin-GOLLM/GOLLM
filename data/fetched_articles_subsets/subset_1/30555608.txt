T-wave morphology changes are linked to dispersion of ventricular 
repolarization. I encountered an 80-year-old man on hemodialysis manifesting 
momentary giant T-waves and QT prolongation on the 12-lead electrocardiogram, 
soon after initiating mechanical ventilation because of hypercapnic respiratory 
failure. A computed tomography of the brain showed no acute cerebrovascular 
accidents. An echocardiogram showed no left ventricular asynergy. Mechanisms 
that may be responsible for this phenomenon are discussed. Interpreting the 
giant T-waves with the concept of the three bipolar limb lead vectors, the 
Einthoven's triangle leads to recognize origin of the electrocardiographic 
T-wave.
