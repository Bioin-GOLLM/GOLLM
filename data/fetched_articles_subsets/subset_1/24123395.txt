This review article presents, an overview of the DNA glycosylases that recognize 
oxidized DNA bases using the Fpg/Nei family of DNA glycosylases as models for 
how structure can inform function. For example, even though human NEIL1 and the 
plant and fungal orthologs lack the zinc finger shown to be required for 
binding, DNA crystal structures revealed a "zincless finger" with the same 
properties. Moreover, the "lesion recognition loop" is not involved in lesion 
recognition, rather, it stabilizes 8-oxoG in the active site pocket. Unlike the 
other Fpg/Nei family members, Neil3 lacks two of the three void-filling residues 
that stabilize the DNA duplex and interact with the opposite strand to the 
damage which may account for its preference for lesions in single-stranded DNA. 
Also single-molecule approaches show that DNA glycosylases search for their 
substrates in a sea of undamaged DNA by using a wedge residue that is inserted 
into the DNA helix to probe for the presence of damage.
