Currently, drug discovery approaches commonly assume a monotonic dose-response 
relationship. However, the assumption of monotonicity is increasingly being 
challenged. Here we show that for two simple interacting linear signaling 
pathways that carry two different signals with different physiological 
responses, a non-monotonic input-output relation can arise with simple network 
topologies including coherent and incoherent feed-forward loops. We show that 
non-monotonicity of the response functions has severe implications for 
pharmacological treatment. Fundamental constraints are imposed on the 
effectiveness and toxicity of any drug independent of its chemical nature and 
selectivity due to the specific network structure.
