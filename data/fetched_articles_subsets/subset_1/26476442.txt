Ribosome biogenesis is one of the most essential pathways in eukaryotes although 
it is still not fully characterized. Given the importance of this process in 
proliferating cells, it is obvious that understanding the macromolecular details 
of the interactions that take place between the assembly factors, ribosomal 
proteins and nascent pre-rRNAs is essentially required for the development of 
new non-genotoxic treatments for cancer. Herein, we have studied the association 
between the WD40-repeat domains of Erb1 and Ytm1 proteins. These are essential 
factors for the biogenesis of 60S ribosomal subunits in eukaryotes that form a 
heterotrimeric complex together with the also essential Nop7 protein. We provide 
the crystal structure of a dimer formed by the C-terminal part of Erb1 and Ytm1 
from Chaetomium thermophilum at 2.1 Å resolution. Using a multidisciplinary 
approach we show that the β-propeller domains of these proteins interact in a 
novel manner that leads to a high-affinity binding. We prove that a point 
mutation within the interface of the complex impairs the interaction between the 
two proteins and negatively affects growth and ribosome production in yeast. Our 
study suggests insights into the association of the Erb1-Ytm1 dimer with 
pre-ribosomal particles.
