Multivalent interaction is an important principle for self-assembly and has been 
widely used to assemble colloids. However, surface binding partners are 
statistically distributed, which falls short of the interaction possibilities 
arising from geometrically controlled multivalency patterns as seen in viruses. 
Herein, the precision provided by 3D DNA origami is exploited to introduce 
multivalency pattern recognition via designing geometrically precise interaction 
patterns at patches of patchy nanocylinders. This gives rise to self-sorting of 
colloidal assemblies despite having the same type and number of supramolecular 
binding motifs-solely based on the pattern located on a 20 × 20 nm2 
cross-section. The degree of sorting can be modulated by the geometric overlap 
of patterns and homo; mixed and alternating supracolloidal polymerizations are 
demonstrated. Multivalency patterns are able to provide an additional 
information layer to organize soft matter, important towards engineering of 
biological responses and functional materials design.
