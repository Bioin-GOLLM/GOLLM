BACKGROUND: The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
apolipoprotein (Apo) A1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster and serum lipid profiles is 
inconsistent. The present study was undertaken to detect the association between 
the ApoA1/C3/A5 gene polymorphisms and their haplotypes with serum lipid levels 
in the general Chinese population.
METHODS: A total of 1030 unrelated subjects (492 males and 538 females) aged 
15-89 were randomly selected from our previous stratified randomized cluster 
samples. Genotyping of the ApoA1 -75 bp G>A, ApoC3 3238C>G, ApoA5 -1131T>C, 
ApoA5 c.553G>T and ApoA5 c.457G>A was performed by polymerse chain reaction and 
restriction fragment length polymorphism combined with gel electrophoresis, and 
then confirmed by direct sequencing. Pair-wise linkage disequilibria and 
haplotype analysis among the five SNPs were estimated.
RESULTS: The levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and ApoA1 
were lower in males than in femailes (P < 0.05 for each). The allelic and 
genotypic frequencies of the SNPs were no significant difference between males 
and females except ApoC3 3238C>G. There were 11 haplotypes with a frequency >1% 
identified in the cluster in our population. At the global level, the haplotypes 
comprised of all five SNPs were significantly associated with all seven lipid 
traits. In particular, haplotype G-G-C-C-A (6%; in the order of ApoA5 c.553G>T, 
ApoA5 c.457G>A, ApoA5 -1131T>C, ApoC3 3238C>G, and ApoA1 -75bp G>A) and 
G-A-T-C-G (4%) showed consistent association with total cholesterol (TC), 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), ApoA1, ApoB, and the ApoA1/ApoB 
ratio. In addition, carriers of haplotype G-G-T-C-G (26%) had increased serum 
concentration of HDL-C and ApoA1, whereas carriers of G-G-C-G-G (15%) had high 
concentrations of TC, triglyceride (TG) and ApoB. We also found that haplotypes 
with five SNPs explain much more serum lipid variation than any single SNP 
alone, especially for TG (4.4% for haplotype vs. 2.4% for -1131T>C max based on 
R-square) and HDL-C (5.1% for haplotype vs. 0.9% for c.553G>T based on 
R-square). Serum lipid parameters were also correlated with genotypes and 
several environment factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Several common SNPs and their haplotypes in the ApoA1/C3/A5 gene 
cluster are closely associated with modifications of serum lipid parameters in 
the general Chinese population.
