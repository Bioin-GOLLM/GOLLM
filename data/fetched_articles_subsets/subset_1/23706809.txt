The AAA+ superfamily of proteins is a class of motor ATPases performing a wide 
range of functions that typically exist as hexamers. The ATPase of phi29 DNA 
packaging motor has long been a subject of debate in terms of stoichiometry and 
mechanism of action. Here, we confirmed the stoichiometry of phi29 motor ATPase 
to be a hexamer and provide data suggesting that the phi29 motor ATPase is a 
member of the classical hexameric AAA+ superfamily. Native PAGE, EMSA, capillary 
electrophoresis, ATP titration, and binomial distribution assay show that the 
ATPase is a hexamer. Mutations in the known Walker motifs of the ATPase 
validated our previous assumptions that the protein exists as another member of 
this AAA+ superfamily. Our data also supports the finding that the phi29 DNA 
packaging motor uses a revolution mechanism without rotation or coiling 
(Schwartz et al., this issue).
