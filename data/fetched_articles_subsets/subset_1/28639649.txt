Computational enzyme design exhibits excellent performance for identifying 
potential scaffolds from structural databases and creating new enzymatic 
catalysts from naught. Using the active site-matching algorithm ProdaMatch, we 
identified a new scaffold cocaine esterase from Rhodococcus sp. that showed 
modest activity (kcat/Km = 0.018 M-1 s-1) towards the hydrolysis of β-lactam 
antibiotic cephradine. The identified cocaine esterase scaffold afforded low 
sequence identity (<30%) with the known β-lactam synthases, such as penicillin G 
acylase or α-amino acid ester hydrolase, and was able to catalyze the 
condensation reaction between d-dihydrophenylglycine methyl ester and 
7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid to produce cephradine via a kinetically 
controlled synthesis. By virtue of the computational enzyme design protocol, 
hundreds of sequences were predicted in the cocaine esterase scaffold to promote 
the catalytic activity towards the hydrolytic reaction of cephradine. Moreover, 
a single mutant (F261T) was experimentally confirmed to have improved the 
catalytic efficiency by ten times (kcat/Km = 0.193 M-1 s-1), indicating that the 
novel scaffold cocaine esterase may be potentially redesigned to become an 
industrially useful cephradine synthase.
