Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancers 
(CRC) and is associated with an increased risk for ovarian and endometrial 
cancers. There is lack of knowledge on the epidemiology of LS in the 
non-Caucasian populations especially in Qatar. The aim of this retrospective 
study is to explore the prevalence of LS in a selected high-risk cohort in the 
State of Qatar in addition to investigating the frequency and genotype-phenotype 
correlation associated with mismatch repair genes pathogenic variants. 
Retrospective review of medical records of 31 individuals with LS, 20 affected 
with colorectal cancer and 11 unaffected with family history of cancers, 
referred from January 2017 until August 2020. The prevalence of LS among 
affected and unaffected patients is 22% (20/92) and 2.2% respectively. Among 
affected individuals, MLH1 and MSH2 genes were highly frequent while for 
unaffected individuals, a recurrent PMS2 pathogenic variant was reported in 
several related individuals suggesting a tribal effect. This study highlights 
the epidemiology of LS in high-risk cohort in Qatar which helps to provide 
recommendations on genetic testing, and personalize surveillance and management 
programs.
