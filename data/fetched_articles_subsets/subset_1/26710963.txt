BACKGROUND: Adenosine may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasovagal syncope 
(VVS). The aim of the study was to evaluate the adenosine A(2A) receptor gene 
1083 T > C polymorphism in patients with syncope and its possible association 
with results of head-up tilt test (HUT).
METHODS: Three hundred and forty-seven consecutive patients (mean age 47.3 ± 
18.5 years, 132 men, 215 women) with one or more syncopal episodes underwent HUT 
as part of standardized diagnostic evaluation. HUT was positive in 207 patients 
(75 males, mean age 44.7 ± 18.6 years) and negative in 140 patients (58 males, 
mean age 48.17 ± 18.8 years). One thousand and eighty-three T > C single 
nucleotide polymorphism in the adenosine A(2A) receptor gene (rs5751876) was 
evaluated in 347 patients with syncope and in 85 subjects without history of 
syncope (54 men, mean age 41.7 ± 16.3).
RESULTS: Adenosine A(2A) receptor 1083 T > C polymorphism was not associated 
with the positivity of HUT. Blood pressure and heart rate response to tilting 
was similar in all genotypes. Low frequency (LF) power was significantly lower 
in CC genotype compared to CT genotype in early phase of tilt (log LF 2.69 ± 
0.61 vs 3.20 ± 0.60; P = 0.01) and at the time of syncope (log LF 2.60 ± 0.63 vs 
2.77 ± 0.48; P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine A(2A) receptor 1083 T > C polymorphism is not associated 
with the positivity of HUT and its proposed role in predisposition to VVS was 
not confirmed. CC genotype may be associated with lower sympathetic activity 
during HUT.
