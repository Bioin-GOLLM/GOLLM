Various mycoviruses have been isolated from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Here, we 
identified a viral RNA sequence contig, representing a novel virus, Sclerotinia 
sclerotiorum deltaflexivirus 2 (SsDFV2), from an RNA_Seq database. We found that 
SsDFV2 was harbored in the hypovirulent strain, 228, which grew slowly on potato 
dextrose agar, produced a few sclerotia, and could not induce typical lesions on 
detached rapeseed (Brassica napus) leaves. Strain 228 was also infected by 
Botrytis porri RNA Virus 1 (BpRV1), a virus originally isolated from Botrytis 
porri. The genome of SsDFV2 comprised 6711 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) 
tail, and contained a single large predicted open reading frame encoding a 
putative viral RNA replicase. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that SsDFV2 is 
closely related to viruses in the family Deltaflexiviridae; however, it also 
differs significantly from members of this family, suggesting that it may 
represent a new species. Further we determined that SsDFV2 could be efficiently 
transmitted to host vegetative incompatible individuals by dual culture. To our 
best knowledge, this is the first report that a (+) ssRNA mycovirus can overcome 
the transmission limitations of the vegetative incompatibility system, a 
phenomenon that may facilitate the potential use of mycoviruses for the control 
of crop fungal diseases.
