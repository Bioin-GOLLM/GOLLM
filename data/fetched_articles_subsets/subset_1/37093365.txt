CONTEXT: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, the 2019-nCov coronavirus has 
appeared diverse mutational characteristics due to its own flexible 
conformation. One multiple-mutant strain (Omicron) with surprisingly infective 
activity outburst, and affected the biological activities of current drugs and 
vaccines, making the epidemic significantly difficult to prevent and control, 
and seriously threaten health around the world. Importunately exploration of 
mutant characteristics for novel coronavirus Omicron can supply strong 
theoretical guidance for learning binding mechanism of mutant viruses. What's 
more, full acknowledgement of key mutated-residues on Omicron strain can provide 
new methodology of the novel pathogenic mechanism to human ACE2 receptor, as 
well as the subsequent vaccine development.
METHODS: In this research, 3D structures of 32 single-point mutations of 
2019-nCov were firstly constructed, and 32-sites multiple-mutant Omicron were 
finally obtained based one the wild-type virus by homology modeling method. One 
total number of 33 2019-nCov/ACE2 complex systems were acquired by 
protein-protein docking, and optimized by using preliminary molecular dynamic 
simulations. Binding free energies between each 2019-nCov mutation system and 
human ACE2 receptor were calculated, and corresponding binding patterns 
especially the regions adjacent to mutation site were analyzed. The results 
indicated that one total number of 6 mutated sites on the Omicron strain played 
crucial role in improving binding capacities from 2019-nCov to ACE2 protein. 
Subsequently, we performed long-term molecular dynamic simulations and 
protein-protein binding energy analysis for the selected 6 mutations. 3 infected 
individuals, the mutants T478K, Q493R and G496S with lower binding energies 
-66.36, -67.98 and -67.09 kcal/mol also presents the high infectivity. These 
findings indicated that the 3 mutations T478K, Q493R and G496S play the crucial 
roles in enhancing binding affinity of Omicron to human ACE2 protein. All these 
results illuminate important theoretical guidance for future virus detection of 
the Omicron epidemic, drug research and vaccine development.
