BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endotoxemia (ET) is a common critical illness in patients 
receiving intensive care and is associated with high mortality and prolonged 
hospital stay. The intestinal epithelial cell dysfunction is regarded as the 
"engine" of deteriorated ET. Although electroacupuncture (EA) can mitigate 
endotoxin-induced intestinal epithelial cell dysfunction in ET, the mechanism 
through which EA improves endotoxin-induced intestinal injury for preventing ET 
deterioration needs further investigation.
METHODS: An in vivo ET model was developed by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
in wild-type and PINK1-knockout mice. An in vitro model was also established by 
incubating epithelial cells in the serum samples obtained from both groups of 
mice. Hemin and zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) were applied to activate or 
inhibit heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) production. EA treatment was performed for 
30 min consecutively for 5 days before LPS injection, and on the day of the 
experiment, EA was performed throughout the process. Samples were harvested at 
6 h after LPS induction for analyzing tissue injury, oxidative stress, ATP 
production, activity of diamine oxidase (DAO), and changes in the levels of 
HO-1, PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), mitochondrial fusion and fission 
marker gene, caspase-1, and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β).
RESULTS: In the wild-type models (both in vivo and vitro), EA alleviated 
LPS-induced intestinal injury and mitochondrial dysfunction, as indicated by 
decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxygen consumption rate 
(OCR) and reduced levels of mitochondrial fission proteins. EA treatment also 
boosted histopathological morphology, ATP levels, DAO activity, and levels of 
mitochondrial fusion proteins in vivo and vitro. The effect of EA was enhanced 
by hemin but suppressed by Znpp. However, EA + AP, Znpp, or hemin had no effects 
on the LPS-induced, PINK1-knocked out mouse models.
CONCLUSION: EA may improve the HO-1/PINK1 pathway-mediated mitochondrial dynamic 
balance to protect the intestinal barrier in patients with ET.
