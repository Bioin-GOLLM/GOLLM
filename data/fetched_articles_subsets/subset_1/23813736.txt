The fundamental theory of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was 
established in the 1940s. Its great power was only realized in the past 20 years 
after different techniques were developed and applied to biological experiments. 
This success was made possible by the availability of suitable fluorescent 
probes, advanced optics, detectors, microscopy instrumentation, and analytical 
tools. Combined with state-of-the-art microscopy and spectroscopy, FRET imaging 
allows scientists to study a variety of phenomena that produce changes in 
molecular proximity, thereby leading to many significant findings in the life 
sciences. In this review, we outline various FRET imaging techniques and their 
strengths and limitations; we also provide a biological model to demonstrate how 
to investigate protein-protein interactions in living cells using both 
intensity- and fluorescence lifetime-based FRET microscopy methods.
