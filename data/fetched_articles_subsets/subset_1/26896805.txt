Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome caused by mutations within the 
functional domains ofNSD1 gene coding for NSD1, a multidomain protein regulating 
chromatin structure and gene expression. In particular, PHDVC5HCHNSD1 tandem 
domain, composed by a classical (PHDV) and an atypical (C5HCH) plant 
homeo-domain (PHD) finger, is target of several pathological missense-mutations. 
PHDVC5HCHNSD1 is also crucial for NSD1-dependent transcriptional regulation and 
interacts with the C2HR domain of transcriptional repressor Nizp1 (C2HRNizp1)in 
vitro To get molecular insights into the mechanisms dictating the 
patho-physiological relevance of the PHD finger tandem domain, we solved its 
solution structure and provided a structural rationale for the effects of seven 
Sotos syndrome point-mutations. To investigate PHDVC5HCHNSD1 role as structural 
platform for multiple interactions, we characterized its binding to histone H3 
peptides and to C2HRNizp1 by ITC and NMR. We observed only very weak 
electrostatic interactions with histone H3 N-terminal tails, conversely we 
proved specific binding to C2HRNizp1 We solved C2HRNizp1 solution structure and 
generated a 3D model of the complex, corroborated by site-directed mutagenesis. 
We suggest a mechanistic scenario where NSD1 interactions with cofactors such as 
Nizp1 are impaired by PHDVC5HCHNSD1 pathological mutations, thus impacting on 
the repression of growth-promoting genes, leading to overgrowth conditions.
