Early vertebrate embryos possess cells with the potential to generate all 
embryonic cell types. While this pluripotency is progressively lost as cells 
become lineage restricted, Neural Crest cells retain broad developmental 
potential. Here, we provide novel insights into signals essential for both 
pluripotency and neural crest formation in Xenopus. We show that FGF signaling 
controls a subset of genes expressed by pluripotent blastula cells, and find a 
striking switch in the signaling cascades activated by FGF signaling as cells 
lose pluripotency and commence lineage restriction. Pluripotent cells display 
and require Map Kinase signaling, whereas PI3 Kinase/Akt signals increase as 
developmental potential is restricted, and are required for transit to certain 
lineage restricted states. Importantly, retaining a high Map Kinase/low Akt 
signaling profile is essential for establishing Neural Crest stem cells. These 
findings shed important light on the signal-mediated control of pluripotency and 
the molecular mechanisms governing genesis of Neural Crest.
