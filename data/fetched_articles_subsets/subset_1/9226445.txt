We report that DPP signaling is required for directed tracheal cell migration 
during Drosophila embryogenesis. The failure of tracheal cells to receive the 
DPP signal from adjacent dorsal and ventral cells results in the absence of 
dorsal and ventral migrations. Ectopic DPP signaling can reprogram cells in the 
center of the placode to adopt a dorsoventral migration behavior. The effects 
observed in response to ectopic DPP signaling are also observed upon the 
tracheal-specific expression of a constitutive active DPP type I receptor 
(TKV(Q253D)), indicating that the DPP signal is received and transmitted in 
tracheal cells to control their migration behavior. DPP signaling determines 
localized gene expression patterns in the developing tracheal placode, and is 
also required for the dorsal expression of the recently identified BRANCHLESS 
(BNL) guidance molecule, the ligand of the BREATHLESS (BTL) receptor. Thus, DPP 
plays a dual role during tracheal cell migration. It is required to control the 
dorsal expression of the BNL ligand; in addition, the DPP signal recruits groups 
of dorsal and ventral tracheal cells and programs them to migrate in dorsal and 
ventral directions.
