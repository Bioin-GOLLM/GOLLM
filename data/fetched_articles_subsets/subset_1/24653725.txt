Programed DNA mutagenesis events in the immunoglobulin (Ig) loci of developing B 
cells utilize the common and conserved mechanism of protein ubiquitination for 
subsequent proteasomal degradation to generate the required antigen-receptor 
diversity. Recombinase proteins RAG1 and RAG2, necessary for V(D)J 
recombination, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase, an essential mutator 
protein for catalyzing class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, are 
regulated by various ubiquitination events that affect protein stability and 
activity. Programed DNA breaks in the Ig loci can be identified by various 
components of DNA repair pathways, also regulated by protein ubiquitination. 
Errors in the ubiquitination pathways for any of the DNA double-strand break 
repair proteins can lead to inefficient recombination and repair events, 
resulting in a compromised adaptive immune system or development of cancer.
