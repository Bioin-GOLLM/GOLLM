Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] caused by 
Phytophthora sojae is a destructive disease worldwide. Phenylalanine 
ammonia-lyase (PAL) is one of the most extensively studied enzymes related to 
plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the molecular mechanism 
of PAL in soybean in response to P. sojae is largely unclear. Here, we 
characterize a novel member of the soybean PAL gene family, GmPAL2.1, which is 
significantly induced by P. sojae. Overexpression and RNA interference analysis 
demonstrates that GmPAL2.1 enhances resistance to P. sojae in transgenic soybean 
plants. In addition, the PAL activity in GmPAL2.1-OX transgenic soybean is 
significantly higher than that of non-transgenic plants after infection with P. 
sojae, while that in GmPAL2.1-RNAi soybean plants is lower. Further analyses 
show that the daidzein, genistein and salicylic acid (SA) levels and the 
relative content of glyceollins are markedly increased in GmPAL2.1-OX transgenic 
soybean. Taken together, these results suggest the important role of GmPAL2.1 
functioning as a positive regulator in the soybean response to P. sojae 
infection, possibly by enhancing the content of glyceollins, daidzein, genistein 
and SA.
