Nitriles (N≡CR) are ubiquitous in coordination chemistry, yet literature studies 
on metal-nitrile bonding based on a multi-technique approach are rare. We 
selected an easily-available di-organoiron framework, containing both π-acceptor 
(CO, aminocarbyne) and donor (Cp = η5-C5H5) ligands, as a suitable system to 
provide a comprehensive description of the iron-nitrile bond. Thus, the new 
nitrile (2-12)CF3SO3 and the related imine/amine complexes (8-9)CF3SO3 were 
synthesized in 58-83% yields from the respective tris-carbonyl precursors 
(1a-d)CF3SO3, using the TMNO strategy (TMNO = trimethylamine-N-oxide). The 
products were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR (solution and solid 
state) and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the structures of 
(2)CF3SO3, (3)CF3SO3, (5)CF3SO3 and (11)CF3SO3 were ascertained by single 
crystal X-ray diffraction. Salient spectroscopic data of the nitrile complexes 
are coherent with the scale of electron-donor power of the R substituents; 
otherwise, this scale does not match the degree of Fe → N π-back-donation and 
the Fe-N bond energies, which were elucidated in (2-7)CF3SO3 by DFT 
calculations.
