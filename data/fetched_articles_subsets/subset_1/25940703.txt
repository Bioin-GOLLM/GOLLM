Breast cancer is classified into different subtypes that are associated with 
different patient survival outcomes, underscoring the importance of 
understanding the role of precursor cell and genetic alterations in determining 
tumor subtypes. In this study, we evaluated the oncogenic phenotype of two 
distinct mammary stem/progenitor cell types designated as K5+/K19- or K5+/K19+ 
upon introduction of identical combinations of oncogenes-mutant H-Ras (mRas) and 
mutant p53 (mp53), together with either wild-type ErbB2(wtErbB2) or wild-type 
EGFR (wtEGFR). We examined their tumor forming and metastasis potential, using 
both in-vitro and in-vivo assays. Both the combinations efficiently transformed 
K5+/K19- or K5+/K19+ cells. Xenograft tumors formed by these cells were 
histologically heterogeneous, with variable proportions of luminal, basal-like 
and claudin-low type components depending on the cell types and oncogene 
combinations. Notably, K5+/K19- cells transformed with mRas/mp53/wtEGFR 
combination had a significantly longer latency for primary tumor development 
than other cell lines but more lung metastasis incidence than same cells 
expressing mRas/mp53/wtErbB2. K5+/K19+ cells exhibit shorter overall tumor 
latency, and high metastatic potential than K5+/K19- cells, suggesting that 
these K19+ progenitors are more susceptible to oncogenesis and metastasis. Our 
results suggest that both genetic alterations and cell type of origin contribute 
to oncogenic phenotype of breast tumors.
