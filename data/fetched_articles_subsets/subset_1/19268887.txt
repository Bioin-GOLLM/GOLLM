PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics of the polymorphisms in the ARMS2 gene 
in Japanese patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and those with 
polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) and in healthy controls, and also to 
show possible associations of the polymorphisms with the disease.
DESIGN: Case-control association study.
METHODS: Fifty-six unrelated Japanese individuals with AMD, 55 with PCV, and 77 
controls were studied. The most common polymorphism in the ARMS2 gene on 
chromosome 10 was resequenced. Association tests were performed for inferred 
haplotypes.
RESULTS: A total of 22 polymorphisms were identified, and 13 were shared with 
those in White persons with AMD. The sequence of the deletion-and-insertion 
polymorphism, de1443ins54, a functional polymorphism causing an instability of 
the messenger ribonucleic acid of ARMS2 in the Japanese, did not differ from 
that in White persons. Among the polymorphisms seen in the White population, 
rs10490923 (R3H) as well as 7 other polymorphisms were not observed in the 
Japanese. One haplotype, which contained the T allele of the rs10490924 (A69S) 
and the variant of de1443ins54 polymorphism, had an odds ratio of 3.14 (P = 7.8 
x 10(-6)) for AMD and 2.00 (P = .0058) for PCV. Among the 9 polymorphisms that 
were unique to the Japanese population, 2 had a minor allelic frequency of more 
than 0.05, and these 2 polymorphism were included as nonrisk haplotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The de1443ins54 polymorphism is a common variant between White and 
Japanese populations. It is strongly associated not only with AMD but also with 
PCV.
