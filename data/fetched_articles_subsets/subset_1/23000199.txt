The mechanism by which myristoylated proteins are targeted to specific 
subcellular membrane compartments is poorly understood. Two novel acyl-binding 
proteins, UNC119A and UNC119B, have been shown recently to function as 
chaperones/co-factors in the transport of myristoylated G protein α-subunits and 
src-type tyrosine kinases. UNC119 polypeptides feature an immunoglobulin-like 
β-sandwich fold that forms a hydrophobic pocket capable of binding lauroyl (C12) 
and myristoyl (C14) side chains. UNC119A in rod photoreceptors facilitates the 
transfer of transducin α subunits (Tα) from inner segment to outer segment 
membranes by forming an intermediate diffusible UNC119-Tα complex. Similar 
complexes are formed in other sensory neurons, as the G proteins ODR-3 and 
GPA-13 in Caenorhabditis elegans unc-119 mutants traffic inappropriately. 
UNC119B knockdown in IMCD3 cells prevents trafficking ofmyristoylated 
nephrocystin-3 (NPHP3), a protein associated with nephronophthisis, to cilia. 
Further, UNC119A was shown to transport myristoylated src-type tyrosine kinases 
to cell membranes and to affect T-cell receptor (TCR) and interleukin-5 receptor 
(IL-5R) activities. These interactions establish UNC119 polypeptides as novel 
lipid-binding chaperones with specificity for a diverse subset of myristoylated 
proteins.
