The lipid transporter Arv1 regulates sterol trafficking, and 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol and sphingolipid biosyntheses in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. ScArv1 contains an Arv1 homology domain (AHD) that is conserved at 
the amino acid level in the pathogenic fungal species, Candida albicans and 
Candida glabrata. Here we show S. cerevisiae cells lacking Arv1 are highly 
susceptible to antifungal drugs. In the presence of drug, Scarv1 cells are 
unable to induce ERG gene expression, have an altered pleiotrophic drug 
response, and are defective in multi-drug resistance efflux pump expression. All 
phenotypes are remediated by ectopic expression of CaARV1 or CgARV1. The AHDs of 
these pathogenic fungi are required for specific drug tolerance, demonstrating 
conservation of function. In order to understand how Arv1 regulates antifungal 
susceptibility, we examined sterol trafficking. CaARV1/CgARV1 expression 
suppressed the sterol trafficking defect of Scarv1 cells. Finally, we show that 
C. albicansarv1/arv1 cells are avirulent using a BALB/c disseminated mouse 
model. We suggest that overall cell survival in response to antifungal treatment 
requires the lipid transporter function of Arv1.
