BACKGROUND: Case-control studies have successfully identified many genetic 
associations for complex diseases but suffer from lack of reproducibility in the 
same population. Demonstrating weak genetic effect requires large sample sizes 
to minimize statistical bias. Based on a study examining 500 myocardial 
infarction (MI) patients and 500 controls from the genetically isolated 
Newfoundland population, we previously reported that thrombospondin-4 (THBS-4) 
1186G>C variant associates with MI in women. To validate this sex-dependent 
association with the THBS-4 variant, we analyzed an additional 532 patients and 
514 controls from the same population and the combined cohort consisting of 1032 
patients and 1014 controls.
METHODS: Genotyping of THBS-4 1186G>C was conducted using Taq Man 1186G>C 
(A3879P) (rs 1866389) genotyping technology on real-time polymerase chain 
reaction.
RESULTS: The genotype distributions of THBS-4 1186G>C in the validation and 
combined cohorts were similar with those in our initial study, which supports 
genetic homogeneity in the studied population. The association of the CC 
genotype with MI in women (odds ratio [OR], 2.96; P = .008) reported in our 
initial cohort failed to achieve statistical significance in our validation 
cohort (OR, 1.53; P = .307) but was confirmed in the combined cohort (OR, 2.14; 
P = .009). In contrast to the results from the initial cohort was a significant 
association of the CC genotype with later onset MI in the validation (OR, 2.37; 
P = .029) and combined cohorts (OR, 2.22; P = .011). Moreover, the larger 
studied population gave statistical power to associate the CC genotype with risk 
of MI in the total patient population (OR, 1.58; P = .023).
CONCLUSION: Homozygosity for the THBS-4 1186C variant is a weak risk factor for 
MI especially in older women.
