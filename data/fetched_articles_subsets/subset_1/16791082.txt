CADASIL is associated with mutations in the Notch3 gene but the causal 
mechanisms of the disorder remain unclear. We studied effects of widely 
established mutations on Notch3 receptor processing and ligand-mediated 
activation in stable lines of HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells expressing either human 
wild-type or mutant Notch3 receptor. None of the four mutations (R90C, R133C, 
C185R and R449C) affected quantities of the full-length, amino-terminal or 
carboxyl-terminal fragments and did not impair intracellular trafficking in both 
cell types. The Jagged 1, Jagged 2 and Delta ligand-mediated S2 site cleavage 
and signal transduction were also observed to be similar in both wild-type and 
mutants, which exhibited similar rates of degradation of full-length, 
amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal fragments. Our results suggest that the 
arteriopathy in CADASIL is caused by other mechanisms not necessarily involving 
Notch3 processing and activation.
