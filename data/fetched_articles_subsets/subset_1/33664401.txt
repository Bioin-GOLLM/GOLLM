Morphological variations in human teeth have long been recognized and, in 
particular, the spatial and temporal distribution of two patterns of dental 
features in Asia, i.e., Sinodonty and Sundadonty, have contributed to our 
understanding of the human migration history. However, the molecular mechanisms 
underlying such dental variations have not yet been completely elucidated. 
Recent studies have clarified that a nonsynonymous variant in the ectodysplasin 
A receptor gene (EDAR 370V/A; rs3827760) contributes to crown traits related to 
Sinodonty. In this study, we examined the association between the EDAR 
polymorphism and tooth root traits by using computed tomography images and 
identified that the effects of the EDAR variant on the number and shape of roots 
differed depending on the tooth type. In addition, to better understand tooth 
root morphogenesis, a computational analysis for patterns of tooth roots was 
performed, assuming a reaction-diffusion system. The computational study 
suggested that the complicated effects of the EDAR polymorphism could be 
explained when it is considered that EDAR modifies the syntheses of multiple 
related molecules working in the reaction-diffusion dynamics. In this study, we 
shed light on the molecular mechanisms of tooth root morphogenesis, which are 
less understood in comparison to those of tooth crown morphogenesis.
