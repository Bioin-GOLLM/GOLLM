Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type-1 is a rare genetic disorder of 
ineffective erythropoiesis, which manifests in macrocytic anemia. We report a 
CDA1 patient who as a newborn presented with macrocytic anemia and persistent 
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) requiring mechanical ventilation. 
Post-infancy, the patient developed acral dysmorphism and pectus excavatum the 
latter rarely found in CDA1. Patient is a compound heterozygote for a known 
maternal-derived missense-mutation (c.1796A > G/p.Asn589Ser) and a novel 
paternal-derived deletion-mutation (c.1104_1106del/Phe365del) in CDAN1. This 
report highlights the importance of recognizing PPHN as a presenting symptom of 
CDA1 and expands the repertoire of the accompanying mutations and axial skeletal 
malformations.
