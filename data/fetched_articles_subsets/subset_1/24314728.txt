Progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex sequentially generate distinct classes 
of projection neurons. Recent work suggests the cortex may contain intrinsically 
fate-restricted progenitors marked by expression of Cux2. However, the 
heterogeneity of the neocortical ventricular zone as well as the contribution of 
lineage-restricted progenitors to the overall cortical neurogenic program 
remains unclear. Here, we utilize in vivo genetic fate mapping to demonstrate 
that Fezf2-expressing radial glial cells (RGCs) exist throughout cortical 
development and sequentially generate all major projection neuron subtypes and 
glia. Moreover, we show that the vast majority of CUX2⁺ cells in the VZ and SVZ 
are migrating interneurons derived from the subcortical telencephalon. 
Examination of the embryonic cortical progenitor population demonstrates that 
Cux2⁺ RGCs generate both deep- and upper-layer projection neurons. These results 
identify Fezf2⁺ radial glial cells as a multipotent neocortical progenitor and 
suggest that the existence, and molecular identity, of laminar-fate-restricted 
RGCs awaits further investigation.
