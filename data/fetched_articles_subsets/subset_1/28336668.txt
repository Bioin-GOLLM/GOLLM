The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a 
master growth regulator that becomes activated at the lysosome in response to 
nutrient cues. Here, we identify cholesterol, an essential building block for 
cellular growth, as a nutrient input that drives mTORC1 recruitment and 
activation at the lysosomal surface. The lysosomal transmembrane protein, 
SLC38A9, is required for mTORC1 activation by cholesterol through conserved 
cholesterol-responsive motifs. Moreover, SLC38A9 enables mTORC1 activation by 
cholesterol independently from its arginine-sensing function. Conversely, the 
Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein, which regulates cholesterol export from the 
lysosome, binds to SLC38A9 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling through its sterol 
transport function. Thus, lysosomal cholesterol drives mTORC1 activation and 
growth signaling through the SLC38A9-NPC1 complex.
