Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, with 
extensive allelic and nonallelic genetic heterogeneity. Autosomal recessive RP 
(arRP) is the most common form of RP worldwide, with at least nine loci known 
and accountable for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA) is the major inhibitory transmitter in the CNS. Different GABA receptors 
are expressed in all retinal layers, and inhibition mediated by GABA receptors 
in the human retina could be related to RP. We have selected chromosomal regions 
containing genes that encode the different subunits of the GABA receptors, for 
homozygosity mapping in inbred families affected by arRP. We identify a new 
locus for arRP, on chromosome 6, between markers D6S257 and D6S1644. Our data 
suggest that 10%-20% of Spanish families affected by typical arRP could have 
linkage to this new locus. This region contains subunits GABRR1 and GABRR2 of 
the GABA-C receptor, which is the effector of lateral inhibition at the retina.
