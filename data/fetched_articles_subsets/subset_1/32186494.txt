Andes virus is unique among hantaviruses because it can be transmitted from 
person to person. This mechanism was previously supported by epidemiologic data 
and genetic evidence based only on partial sequences. We used full-length virus 
sequencing to confirm person-to-person transmission of this virus in a cluster 
of 3 cases in Argentina in 2014.
