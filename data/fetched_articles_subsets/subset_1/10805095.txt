SOD-1-deficient mice demonstrate no loss of motoneurons but are still vulnerable 
to axotomy and ischemic insults. To investigate possible reasons for 
vulnerability of motoneuron populations, we studied changes in ultrastructural 
calcium distribution during maturation in spinal- and oculomotor neurons in 
SOD-1(-/-) mice. Between 3 and 11 months the cytoplasmic component of the 
intracellular calcium changed at a lower rate in spinal motoneurons and motor 
axon terminals in the interosseus muscle of SOD-1(-/-) animals compared to 
wild-type controls. No such dissimilarities were noted in the oculomotor system, 
or in mitochondrial calcium contents of either cell type. These data suggest 
that the lack of SOD-1 may be associated with vulnerability to insult by 
depletion of non-mitochondrial calcium stores selectively in motoneurons lacking 
parvalbumin and/or calbindin D28K.
