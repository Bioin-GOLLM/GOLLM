Acquired drug tolerance has been a major challenge in cancer therapy. Recent 
evidence has revealed the existence of slow-cycling persister cells that survive 
drug treatments and give rise to multi-drug-tolerant mutants in cancer. Cells in 
this dynamic persister state can escape drug treatment by undergoing various 
epigenetic changes, which may result in a transient metabolic rewiring. In this 
study, with the use of untargeted metabolomics and phenotype microarrays, we 
characterize the metabolic profiles of melanoma persister cells mediated by 
treatment with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor. Our findings demonstrate that 
metabolites associated with phospholipid synthesis, pyrimidine, and one-carbon 
metabolism and branched-chain amino acid metabolism are significantly altered in 
vemurafenib persister cells when compared to the bulk cancer population. Our 
data also show that vemurafenib persisters have higher lactic acid consumption 
rates than control cells, further validating the existence of a unique metabolic 
reprogramming in these drug-tolerant cells. Determining the metabolic mechanisms 
underlying persister cell survival and maintenance will facilitate the 
development of novel treatment strategies that target persisters and enhance 
cancer therapy.
