The basal ganglia have been considered to primarily play a role in motor 
processing. A growing body of theoretical and clinical evidence shows that in 
addition to the motor functions the basal ganglia play a key role in perceptual 
and visual disturbances. This role may be evident in patients with basal ganglia 
pathology and subsequent manifestation of symptoms that include cognitive, 
perceptual, and affective disturbances. We present three cases with basal 
ganglia pathology that demonstrate affective and psychotic symptoms. Two of the 
cases presented with late onset psychotic disturbances suggesting likely 
neurological etiologies. The third case presented with treatment refractory 
psychosis and symptoms that are rare for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The role 
of incidental bilateral basal ganglia calcifications in all the cases is 
discussed. A review of current literature highlighting various neuropsychiatric 
manifestations of basal ganglia pathologies in various patients with psychiatric 
symptoms is presented.
