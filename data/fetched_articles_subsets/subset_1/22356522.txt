The alleles RHCE*ceBI (RHCE*ce 48C, 712G, 818T, 1132G) and RHCE*ceSM (RHCE*ce 
48C, 712G, 818T) encode the low-prevalence Rh antigen STEM. These alleles 
frequently travel in cis with RHD*DOL. To estimate the frequency of these 
alleles, we tested a total of more than 700 samples in two populations. Blood 
samples were obtained from patients with sickle cell disease and from blood 
donors of African descent. DNA extractions and analyses were performed by 
standard methods. In the United States, none of 70 patient samples had the 
RHCE*818 nucleotide change. Two of 220 donors (frequency of 0.009) were 
heterozygous for RHCE*818C/T (RHCE*ceBI). One of these samples had RHD/RHD*DOL 
and the other had RHD/RHD*DOL-2. In these 290 samples, no other RHD*DOL alleles 
were found. In Brazil, 1 of 244 patients with sickle cell disease (frequency of 
0.004) and 1 of 171 donors (frequency of 0.006) were heterozygous for 
RHCE*818C/T (RHCE*ceBI). Testing of more than 500 additional samples from people 
of African descent, selected because they had a diverse range of common and 
variant RHCE alleles, did not reveal a sample with RHD*DOL or RHD/RHD*DOL-2 in 
the absence of RHCE*ce(818T). Although the numbers are small, our study shows 
that in the United States, the frequency of RHCE*818T is 0.007 (2 in 290 
samples) and in Brazil it is 0.004 (2 in 515 samples). The four RHCE*818T 
alleles were RHCE*ceBI.
