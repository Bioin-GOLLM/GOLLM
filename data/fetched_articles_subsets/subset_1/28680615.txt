We report a case of Noonan syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS/LAH), a rare 
variant of Noonan syndrome, with associated trichorrhexis nodosa and 
trichoptilosis. The SHOC2 mutation may be responsible for these additional hair 
shaft defects, revealing the importance of microscopic examination of hairs in 
these patients.
