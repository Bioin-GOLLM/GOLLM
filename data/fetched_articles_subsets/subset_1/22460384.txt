Bcl-2 family proteins have important roles in tumor initiation, progression and 
resistance to therapy. Pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins are regulated by their 
interactions with pro-death BH3-only proteins making these protein-protein 
interactions attractive therapeutic targets. Although these interactions have 
been extensively characterized biochemically, there is a paucity of tools to 
assess these interactions in cells. Here, we address this limitation by 
developing quantitative, high throughput microscopy assays to characterize Bcl-2 
and BH3-only protein interactions in live cells. We use fluorescent proteins to 
label the interacting proteins of interest, enabling visualization and 
quantification of their mitochondria-localized interactions. Using tool 
compounds, we demonstrate the suitability of our assays to characterize the 
cellular activity of putative therapeutic molecules that target the interaction 
between pro-survival Bcl-2 and pro-death BH3-only proteins. In addition to the 
relevance of our assays for drug discovery, we anticipate that our work will 
contribute to an improved understanding of the mechanisms that regulate these 
important protein-protein interactions within the cell.
