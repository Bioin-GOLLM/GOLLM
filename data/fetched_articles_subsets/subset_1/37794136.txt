PURPOSE: The MRE11-RAD50-NBN (MRN) complex plays a key role in recognizing and 
signaling DNA double-strand breaks. Pathogenic variants in NBN and MRE11 give 
rise to the autosomal-recessive diseases, Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) and 
ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder, respectively. The clinical consequences of 
pathogenic variants in RAD50 are incompletely understood. We aimed to 
characterize a newly identified RAD50 deficiency/NBS-like disorder (NBSLD) 
patient with bone marrow failure and immunodeficiency.
METHODS: We report on a girl with microcephaly, mental retardation, bird-like 
face, short stature, bone marrow failure and B-cell immunodeficiency. We 
searched for candidate gene by whole-exome sequencing and analyzed the cellular 
phenotype of patient-derived fibroblasts using immunoblotting, radiation 
sensitivity assays and lentiviral complementation experiments.
RESULTS: Compound heterozygosity for two variants in the RAD50 gene (p.Arg83His 
and p.Glu485Ter) was identified in this patient. The expression of RAD50 protein 
and MRN complex formation was maintained in the cells derived from this patient. 
DNA damage-induced activation of the ATM kinase was markedly decreased, which 
was restored by the expression of wild-type (WT) RAD50. Radiosensitivity 
appeared inconspicuous in the patient-derived cell line as assessed by colony 
formation assay. The RAD50R83H missense substitution did not rescue the mitotic 
defect in complementation experiments using RAD50-deficient fibroblasts, whereas 
RAD50WT did. The RAD50E485X nonsense variant was associated with in-frame 
skipping of exon 10 (p.Glu485_545del).
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate important roles of RAD50 in human bone 
marrow and immune cells. RAD50 deficiency/NBSLD can manifest as a distinct 
inborn error of immunity characterized by bone marrow failure and B-cell 
immunodeficiency.
