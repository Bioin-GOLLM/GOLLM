Cells robustly reprogram gene expression during stress generated by protein 
misfolding and aggregation. In this condition, cells assemble the bulk of mRNAs 
into translationally silent stress granules (SGs), while they sustain the 
translation of specific mRNAs coding for proteins that are needed to overcome 
cellular stress. Alterations of this process are deeply associated to 
neurodegeneration. This is the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a 
neurodegenerative disorder caused by a selective loss of motor neurons. Indeed, 
impairment of protein homeostasis as well as alterations of RNA metabolism are 
now recognized as major players in the pathogenesis of ALS. In particular, 
evidence shows that defective mRNA transport and translation are implicated. 
Here, we provide a review of what is currently known about altered mRNA 
translation in ALS and how this impacts on the ability of affected cells to cope 
with proteotoxic stress.
