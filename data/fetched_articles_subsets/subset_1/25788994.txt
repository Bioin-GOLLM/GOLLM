Extrarenal rhabdoid tumors (ERRTs) are extremely rare neoplasms; of these, 
colorectal ERRTs are the most rare, and only nine cases have been previously 
described in the English language literature. The current study reports the 
pathological features of a case of poorly differentiated cecal adenocarcinoma 
with prominent rhabdoid feature, which was combined with mucinous cystadenoma of 
the appendix in a 73-year-old male, and additionally reviews the previously 
reported cases. Microscopically, the majority of tumor cells were non-cohesive 
or loosely cohesive, with a polygonal morphology and prominent rhabdoid feature, 
showing eccentric vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant eosinophilic 
cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 
(CK) and vimentin, but negative for CK20, CK7, desmin and smooth muscle actin. 
This indicated a diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with 
prominent rhabdoid features, combined with appendiceal mucinous cystadenoma. At 
two months following surgery the patient succumbed to peritoneal seeding and 
metastasis of liver and bone The emergence of the rhabdoid phenotype is 
invariably associated with an aggressive and almost always fatal clinical 
course. The present case is the 10th example of such a tumor in the colon, and 
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of colonic rhabdoid tumor 
coinciding with appendiceal benign mucinous neoplasm.
