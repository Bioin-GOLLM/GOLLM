Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is associated with increased incidence of thrombotic 
events. Hypofibrinolysis is associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. 
Although testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) inhibits the hypofibrinolysis, 
it can still cause thrombosis paradoxically due to increased dose and duration 
of use. Herein, we present a case of a young male diagnosed with KS who was 
taking testosterone. The dose was increased to boost the energy levels, and the 
patient presented with abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen 
showed extensive portal vein thrombosis. He was started on enoxaparin followed 
by apixaban. Studies need to be done regarding the need for thromboembolism 
prophylaxis in patients on TRT.
