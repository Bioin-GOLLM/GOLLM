Enzyme-based therapeutics (EBTs) have the potential to tap into an almost 
unmeasurable amount of enzyme biodiversity and treat myriad conditions. Although 
EBTs were some of the first biologics used clinically, the rate of development 
of newer EBTs has lagged behind that of other biologics. Here, we review the 
history of EBTs, and discuss the state of each class of EBT, their potential 
clinical advantages, and the unique challenges to their development. 
Additionally, we discuss key remaining technical barriers that, if addressed, 
could increase the diversity and rate of the development of EBTs.
