BACKGROUND: Given that the CCDC92 (coiled-coil domain containing 92) was 
important in insulin resistance, we sought to investigate whether the CCDC92 
rs825476 SNP is associated with the risk of CHD in Chinese Han population.
METHODS: Rs11057401 was genotyped for 817 patients with CHD and 724 age- and 
sex-matched controls using PCR-based Invader assay with the probe sets designed 
and synthesized by third wave.
RESULTS: Patients were found to have a significantly higher frequency of AA than 
the controls (23.5% vs. 14.7%, OR = 1.60, p = 0.000), and the frequency of 
allele A was found to be remarkably higher in the patients than the controls 
(48.1% vs. 40.3%, OR = 1.19, p = 0.000). Multivariate logistic analysis showed 
that the incidence of CHD was positively correlated with hyperlipidemia, T2D and 
rs11057401 AA/AT genotypes. The FPG, TC, and ApoA1 levels in the CHD patients 
were different among the AA, AT and TT genotypes (P < 0.05), the A allele 
carriers had higher FPG, TC and lower ApoA1 levels than the A allele 
non-carriers (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The genotypic and allelic frequencies of the rs11057401 SNP were 
significantly different between the patients with CHD and controls. Subjects 
with AA genotype or A allele were associated with an increased risk of CHD. The 
AA/AT genotypes were also associated with increased serum FPG, TC and decreased 
ApoA1 in CHD.
