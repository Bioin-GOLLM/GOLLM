BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations in the alpha-B-crystallin (CRYAB) gene have 
initially been associated with myofibrillar myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and 
cataracts. For the first time, peripheral neuropathy is reported here as a novel 
phenotype associated with CRYAB.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed in two unrelated families with 
genetically unsolved axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2), assessing 
clinical, neurophysiological and radiological features.
RESULTS: The pathogenic CRYAB variant c.358A>G;p.Arg120Gly was segregated in all 
affected patients from two unrelated families. The disease presented as late 
onset CMT2 (onset over 40 years) with distal sensory and motor impairment and 
congenital cataracts. Muscle involvement was probably associated in cases 
showing mild axial and diaphragmatic weakness. In all cases, nerve conduction 
studies demonstrated the presence of an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy along 
with chronic neurogenic changes on needle examination.
DISCUSSION: In cases with late onset autosomal dominant CMT2 and congenital 
cataracts, it is recommended that CRYAB is considered for genetic testing. The 
identification of CRYAB mutations causing CMT2 further supports a continuous 
spectrum of expressivity, from myopathic to neuropathic and mixed forms, of a 
growing number of genes involved in protein degradation and chaperone-assisted 
autophagy.
