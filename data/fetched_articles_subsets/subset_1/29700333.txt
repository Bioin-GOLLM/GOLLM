Epidermal keratinocytes achieve sequential differentiation from basal to 
granular layers, and undergo a specific programmed cell death, cornification, to 
form an indispensable barrier of the body. Although elevation of the cytoplasmic 
calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) is one of the factors predicted to regulate 
cornification, the dynamics of [Ca2+]i in epidermal keratinocytes is largely 
unknown. Here using intravital imaging, we captured the dynamics of [Ca2+]i in 
mouse skin. [Ca2+]i was elevated in basal cells on the second time scale in 
three spatiotemporally distinct patterns. The transient elevation of [Ca2+]i 
also occurred at the most apical granular layer at a single cell level, and 
lasted for approximately 40 min. The transient elevation of [Ca2+]i at the 
granular layer was followed by cornification, which was completed within 10 min. 
This study demonstrates the tightly regulated elevation of [Ca2+]i preceding the 
cornification of epidermal keratinocytes, providing possible clues to the 
mechanisms of cornification.
