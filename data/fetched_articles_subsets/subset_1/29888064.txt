Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase implicated as a 
driver of a number of cancer types, and activates cellular pathways involved in 
cell proliferation and differentiation. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a 
small molecule therapeutic that blocks ALK function, but tumor evolution leads 
to the rapid emergence of drug resistant somatic variation and necessitates 
selection of a new treatment strategy. Computational simulations of protein:drug 
interactions were used to investigate the impact of seven drug resistant 
mutations on binding to eleven TKIs approved, or under investigation, for 
treatment of ALK positive cancers. The results show variant specific disruptions 
to TKI molecular interactions, and demonstrate the potential to aid 
prioritization of therapeutic interventions. Validation remains a challenge due 
to the complex dependence of biomolecular interactions on the local biophysical 
environment, but improvements to the underlying structural model and continued 
curation efforts will improve the clinical utility of computational predictions.
