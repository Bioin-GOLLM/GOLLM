Cyclic µ-conotoxin PIIIA, a potent blocker of skeletal muscle voltage-gated 
sodium channel NaV1.4, is a 22mer peptide stabilized by three disulfide bonds. 
Combining electrophysiological measurements with molecular docking and dynamic 
simulations based on NMR solution structures, we investigated the 15 possible 
3-disulfide-bonded isomers of µ-PIIIA to relate their blocking activity at 
NaV1.4 to their disulfide connectivity. In addition, three µ-PIIIA mutants 
derived from the native disulfide isomer, in which one of the disulfide bonds 
was omitted (C4-16, C5-C21, C11-C22), were generated using a targeted protecting 
group strategy and tested using the aforementioned methods. The 
3-disulfide-bonded isomers had a range of different conformational stabilities, 
with highly unstructured, flexible conformations with low or no channel-blocking 
activity, while more constrained molecules preserved 30% to 50% of the native 
isomer's activity. This emphasizes the importance and direct link between 
correct fold and function. The elimination of one disulfide bond resulted in a 
significant loss of blocking activity at NaV1.4, highlighting the importance of 
the 3-disulfide-bonded architecture for µ-PIIIA. µ-PIIIA bioactivity is governed 
by a subtle interplay between an optimally folded structure resulting from a 
specific disulfide connectivity and the electrostatic potential of the 
conformational ensemble.
