Variants of UNC13A, a critical gene for synapse function, increase the risk of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia1-3, two related 
neurodegenerative diseases defined by mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein 
TDP-434,5. Here we show that TDP-43 depletion induces robust inclusion of a 
cryptic exon in UNC13A, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay and loss of UNC13A 
protein. Two common intronic UNC13A polymorphisms strongly associated with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia risk overlap with 
TDP-43 binding sites. These polymorphisms potentiate cryptic exon 
inclusion, both in cultured cells and in brains and spinal cords from patients 
with these conditions. Our findings, which demonstrate a genetic link between 
loss of nuclear TDP-43 function and disease, reveal the mechanism by which 
UNC13A variants exacerbate the effects of decreased TDP-43 function. They 
further provide a promising therapeutic target for TDP-43 proteinopathies.
