PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute pancreatitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) and 
chronic pancreatitis are interrelated and progressive inflammatory disorders of 
the pancreas with highly variable and complex susceptibility, severity and 
outcomes. The role of genetics in acute pancreatitis, RAP and progression to 
chronic pancreatitis within a new framework is needed.
RECENT FINDINGS: The first genome-wide association study in the pancreas has 
been published with genome-wide significance linked with noncoding variants at 
the PRSS1-PRSS2 locus on chromosome seven and the CLDN2 locus on the X 
chromosome. A new personalized medicine paradigm is being considered to 
facilitate organization of genetic and other susceptibility risk compared with 
the risk of disease progression or resolution and risk of complications.
SUMMARY: A new framework for organizing multiple, complex data sets is emerging. 
The role of genetics in the context of other variables is important in 
understanding susceptibility to RAP and in the modification of disease severity 
and progression to chronic pancreatitis. Questions of when to order testing, 
what to order and how to use the data in real time remains an area for future 
research and development.
