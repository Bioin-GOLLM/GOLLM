BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Brucellosis is one of the most prevalent bacterial 
zoonotic diseases which afflicts both humans and animals. Genetic factors play 
an important role in susceptibility to brucellosis. One of these factors is 
interferon-gamma (IFN-), which is vital in the defense mechanism against 
infectious diseases such as brucellosis. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the relationship between two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 
positions -611 and -56 within the promoter region of interferon-gamma receptor-1 
gene (IFN- R1) and brucellosis.
METHODS: In this research, the genomic DNA was collected from 60 peripheral 
blood samples infected with brucellosis and 68 healthy volunteers. DNA was 
extracted by salting out method. Then, DNA genotypes were analyzed using 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: The results showed that there is a significant difference in -611 SNP 
frequencies between control and patient groups. At position -611, CC genotype 
was related to patient group (P=0.024) and TT genotype was related to the 
control group. According to the results, males had a higher frequency of 
Brucella infection.
CONCLUSION: The presence of C allele in position -611 in IFNγ R1 gene promoter 
was related to a higher risk of disease and susceptibility to brucellosis. 
Moreover, the presence of T allele in position γ.
