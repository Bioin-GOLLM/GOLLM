Identifying sources of phytopathogen inoculum and determining their 
contributions to disease outbreaks are essential for predicting disease 
development and establishing control strategies. Puccinia striiformis f. sp. 
tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, is an airborne fungal 
pathogen with rapid virulence variation that threatens wheat production through 
its long-distance migration. Because of wide variation in geographic features, 
climatic conditions, and wheat production systems, Pst sources and related 
dispersal routes in China are largely unclear. In the present study, we 
performed genomic analyses of 154 Pst isolates from all major wheat-growing 
regions in China to determine Pst population structure and diversity. Through 
trajectory tracking, historical migration studies, genetic introgression 
analyses, and field surveys, we investigated Pst sources and their contributions 
to wheat stripe rust epidemics. We identified Longnan, the Himalayan region, and 
the Guizhou Plateau, which contain the highest population genetic diversities, 
as the Pst sources in China. Pst from Longnan disseminates mainly to eastern 
Liupan Mountain, the Sichuan Basin, and eastern Qinghai; that from the Himalayan 
region spreads mainly to the Sichuan Basin and eastern Qinghai; and that from 
the Guizhou Plateau migrates mainly to the Sichuan Basin and the Central Plain. 
These findings improve our current understanding of wheat stripe rust epidemics 
in China and emphasize the need for managing stripe rust on a national scale.
