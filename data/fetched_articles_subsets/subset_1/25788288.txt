Regulation of glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance at synapses by 
clathrin-mediated endocytosis can control synaptic strength and plasticity. We 
take advantage of viable, null mutations in subunits of the clathrin adaptor 
protein 2 (AP2) complex in Caenorhabditis elegans to characterize the in vivo 
role of AP2 in GluR trafficking. In contrast to our predictions for an endocytic 
adaptor, we found that levels of the GluR GLR-1 are decreased at synapses in the 
ventral nerve cord (VNC) of animals with mutations in the AP2 subunits APM-2/μ2, 
APA-2/α, or APS-2/σ2. Rescue experiments indicate that APM-2/μ2 functions in 
glr-1-expressing interneurons and the mature nervous system to promote GLR-1 
levels in the VNC. Genetic analyses suggest that APM-2/μ2 acts upstream of GLR-1 
endocytosis in the VNC. Consistent with this, GLR-1 accumulates in cell bodies 
of apm-2 mutants. However, GLR-1 does not appear to accumulate at the plasma 
membrane of the cell body as expected, but instead accumulates in intracellular 
compartments including Syntaxin-13- and RAB-14-labeled endosomes. This study 
reveals a novel role for the AP2 clathrin adaptor in promoting the abundance of 
GluRs at synapses in vivo, and implicates AP2 in the regulation of GluR 
trafficking at an early step in the secretory pathway.
