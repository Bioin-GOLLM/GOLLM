Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insult and disease by becoming reactive, 
a nonspecific but highly characteristic response that involves various 
morphological and molecular changes. Probably the most recognized aspect of 
reactive astrocytes is the formation of a glial scar that impedes axon 
regeneration. Although the reactive phenotype was first suggested more than 100 
years ago based on morphological changes, the remodeling process is not well 
understood. We know little about the actual structure of a reactive astrocyte, 
how an astrocyte remodels during the progression of an insult, and how 
populations of these cells reorganize to form the glial scar. New methods of 
labeling astrocytes, along with transgenic mice, allow the complete morphology 
of reactive astrocytes to be visualized. Recent studies show that reactivity can 
induce a remarkable change in the shape of a single astrocyte, that not all 
astrocytes react in the same way, and that there is plasticity in the reactive 
response.
