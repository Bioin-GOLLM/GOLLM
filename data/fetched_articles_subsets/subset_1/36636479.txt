Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease that occurs mainly in 
children. It has several forms of clinical presentation. Early diagnosis is 
important for better results. A 17-year-old male patient presented with right 
sharp shoulder pain for 2 months. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the shoulder 
showed an expansile osseous lesion in the anterosuperior spine of the right 
scapula with significant edema that causes compression of the subscapular 
neurovascular bundle. A CT scan and X-rays were also performed. Overall, all the 
images suggested a lesion compatible with chondroblastoma; however, the 
pathology images documented a Langerhans cell histiocytosis with a mutation in 
the V600E/E2/D in the 15 exon of the BRAF gene. LCH is a difficult diagnosis, 
especially in cases where clinical presentation is not the most common. This 
case is unique as the lesion developed not only in the scapula which has a 3% 
prevalence in LCH, but also had radiographic and MRI characteristics of a 
chondroblastoma more than the typical LCH lesion. Additionally, it was 
accompanied by a BRAF V600E mutation which is uncommon in LCHs bone cases.
