The DNA damage response (DDR) and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) are two 
critical mechanisms by which mammalian cells maintain genome stability. There is 
a growing body of evidence that DDR elements and SAC components crosstalk. Here 
we report that Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), one of the 
critical kinetochore proteins essential for SAC, is required for optimal DDRs. 
We found that knocking-down Bub1 resulted in prolonged H2AX foci and comet tail 
formation as well as hypersensitivity in response to ionizing radiation (IR). 
Further, we found that Bub1-mediated Histone H2A Threonine 121 phosphorylation 
was induced after IR in an ATM-dependent manner. We demonstrated that ATM 
phosphorylated Bub1 on serine 314 in response to DNA damage in vivo. Finally, we 
showed that ATM-mediated Bub1 serine 314 phosphorylation was required for 
IR-induced Bub1 activation and for the optimal DDR. Together, we elucidate the 
molecular mechanism of DNA damage-induced Bub1 activation and highlight a 
critical role of Bub1 in DDR.
