Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) is a rare autosomal recessive 
cerebellar ataxia characterized by onset between 10 and 20Â years of age and a 
range of neurological features that include progressive cerebellar atrophy, 
axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia in a majority of patients, 
and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AOA2 is caused by mutation of the 
SETX gene which encodes senataxin, a DNA/RNA helicase involved in transcription 
regulation, RNA processing, and DNA maintenance. Disruption of senataxin in 
rodents led to defective spermatogenesis and sterility in males uncovering a key 
role for senataxin in male germ cell survival. Here, we report the first 
clinical and cellular evidence of impaired spermatogenesis in AOA2 patients. We 
assessed sperm production in three AOA2 patients and testicular pathology in one 
patient and compared the findings to those of Setx-knockout mice. Sperm 
production was impaired in all patients assessed (3/3, 100%). Analyses of 
testicular biopsies from an AOA2 patient recapitulate features of the histology 
seen in Setx-knockout mice, strongly suggesting an underlying mechanism 
centering on DNA-damage-mediated germ cell apoptosis. These findings support a 
role for senataxin in human reproductive function and highlight a novel clinical 
feature of AOA2 that extends the extra-neurological roles of senataxin. This 
raises an important reproductive counseling issue for clinicians, and fertility 
specialists should be aware of SETX mutations as a possible diagnosis in young 
male patients presenting with oligospermia or azoospermia since infertility may 
presage the later onset of neurological manifestations in some individuals.
