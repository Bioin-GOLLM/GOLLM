BACKGROUND: Alpha-L-fucosidase-1 (FUCA1) has been demonstrated to play opposing 
regulatory roles in adenocarcinoma and non-adenocarcinoma. Moreover, recent 
studies reported that FUCA1 could decrease the invasion capability by 
downregulating matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) expression. However, the 
potential role and prognostic significance of FUCA1 in esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (ESCC) have not yet been explored.
AIM: To evaluate the status, association, and prognostic value of FUCA1 and 
MMP-9 expression in ESCC.
METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy for ESCC between January 1, 2014, 
and December 31, 2014 at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center were enrolled. The 
expression status of FUCA1 and MMP-9 in cancerous tissues was detected using 
immunohistochemistry. In addition, the expression profiles of the FUCA1 and 
MMP-9 genes in non-metastatic ESCC were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) database.
RESULTS: High expression of FUCA1 and MMP-9 was found in 90 patients (75.6%) and 
62 patients (52.1%), respectively. In the high FUCA1 expression group, the 
constituent ratios of patients with stage III disease (61.1% vs 37.9%, P = 
0.029), lymphatic invasion (62.2% vs 31.0%, P = 0.003), and high MMP-9 
expression (60.0% vs 27.6%, P = 0.002) were significantly higher than those in 
the low FUCA1 expression group. In Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis, advanced 
tumor-node-metastasis stage (III, P = 0.001), positive regional lymph node 
metastasis (N+, P = 0.002), high FUCA1 expression (P = 0.001), and high MMP-9 
expression (P = 0.002) were potential predictors of shorter overall survival 
(OS), which was similar to the results analyzed based on the TCGA database. 
Further Cox multivariate regression analyses still demonstrated that FUCA1 and 
MMP-9 expression levels were independent prognostic factors of OS [hazard ratio 
(HR): 0.484, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.239-0.979; P = 0.044; and HR: 
0.591, 95%CI: 0.359-0.973, P = 0.039, respectively].
CONCLUSION: FUCA1 cooperation with MMP-9 may have a major role in affecting the 
ESCC invasion and metastatic capability, and serve as a valuable prognostic 
biomarker in ESCC.
