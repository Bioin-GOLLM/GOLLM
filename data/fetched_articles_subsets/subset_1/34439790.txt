The identification of the molecular mechanisms controlling early cell fate 
decisions in mammals is of paramount importance as the ability to determine 
specific lineage differentiation represents a significant opportunity for new 
therapies. Pancreatic Progenitor Cells (PPCs) constitute a regenerative reserve 
essential for the maintenance and regeneration of the pancreas. Besides, PPCs 
represent an excellent model for understanding pathological pancreatic cellular 
remodeling. Given the lack of valid markers of early endoderm, the 
identification of new ones is of fundamental importance. Both products of the 
Ink4a/Arf locus, in addition to being critical cell-cycle regulators, appear to 
be involved in several disease pathologies. Moreover, the locus' expression is 
epigenetically regulated in ES reprogramming processes, thus constituting the 
ideal candidates to modulate PPCs homeostasis. In this study, starting from 
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we analyzed the early stages of pancreatic 
commitment. By inducing mESCs commitment to the pancreatic lineage, we observed 
that both products of the Cdkn2a locus, Ink4a and Arf, mark a na√Øve pancreatic 
cellular state that resembled PPC-like specification. Treatment with epi-drugs 
suggests a role for chromatin remodeling in the CDKN2a (Cycline Dependent Kinase 
Inhibitor 2A) locus regulation in line with previous observations in other 
cellular systems. Our data considerably improve the comprehension of pancreatic 
cellular ontogeny, which could be critical for implementing pluripotent stem 
cells programming and reprogramming toward pancreatic lineage commitment.
