BACKGROUND: The genes RAS and BRAF have been shown to be frequently mutated in 
human thyroid carcinomas. The aim of this study was to genotype a cohort of 55 
sporadic papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) and 44 sporadic medullary thyroid 
carcinomas (MTC) for the K-RAS codon 12 and BRAF codon 600 mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: K-RAS and BRAF mutations were characterized by an 
enhanced polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length 
polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP).
RESULTS: The K-RAS codon 12 mutation was found in 54.5% of the PTC and 40.9% of 
the MTC cases tested. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 27.3% of the PTC 
and 68.2% of the MTC samples. No significant association between K-RAS and BRAF 
mutations and clinicopathological parameters was found.
CONCLUSION: These data indicate that K-RAS and BRAF mutations were a frequent 
genetic event in our samples of sporadic PTC and MTC.
