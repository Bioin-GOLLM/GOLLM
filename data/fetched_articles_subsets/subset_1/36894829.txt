Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
neurodegenerative disease, which belongs to the trinucleotide repeat disease 
group with a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the ATXN2 gene resulting in an 
ataxin-2 protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-stretch. The disease is 
late manifesting leading to early death. Today, therapeutic interventions to 
cure the disease or even to decelerate disease progression are not available 
yet. Furthermore, primary readout parameter for disease progression and 
therapeutic intervention studies are limited. Thus, there is an urgent need for 
quantifiable molecular biomarkers such as ataxin-2 becoming even more important 
due to numerous potential protein-lowering therapeutic intervention strategies. 
The aim of this study was to establish a sensitive technique to measure the 
amount of soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biofluids to evaluate 
ataxin-2 protein levels as prognostic and/or therapeutic biomarker in SCA2. 
Time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) was used to establish a 
polyQ-expanded ataxin-2-specific immunoassay. Two different ataxin-2 antibodies 
and two different polyQ-binding antibodies were validated in three different 
concentrations and tested in cellular and animal tissue as well as in human cell 
lines, comparing different buffer conditions to evaluate the best assay 
conditions. We established a TR-FRET-based immunoassay for soluble 
polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 and validated measurements in human cell lines including 
iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Additionally, our immunoassay was sensitive 
enough to monitor small ataxin-2 expression changes by siRNA or starvation 
treatment. We successfully established the first sensitive ataxin-2 immunoassay 
to measure specifically soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biomaterials.
