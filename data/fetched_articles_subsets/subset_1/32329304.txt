OBJECTIVE: Genetic variations in the gene encoding zinc finger protein 804A gene 
(ZNF804A) have been associated with major depression and bipolar disorder. In 
this work we focused on the potential influence of ZNF804A variations on the 
risk of developing specific sub-phenotypes as well as the individual response to 
available treatments.
METHODS: We used two samples of different ethnic origin: a Korean sample, 
composed by 242 patients diagnosed with major depression and 132 patients 
diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 326 healthy controls; an Italian sample 
composed 151 major depression subjects, 189 bipolar disorder subjects and 38 
outpatients diagnosed for a primary anxiety disorder.
RESULTS: Our analyses reported an association of rs1344706 with psychotic 
phenotype in the cross-diagnostic pooled sample (geno p = 4.15 × 10-4, allelic p 
= 1.06 × 10-4). In the cross-diagnosis Italian sample but not in the Korean one, 
rs7597593 was involved with depressive symptoms improvement after treatment 
(geno p = 0.025, allelic p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: The present study evidenced the role of ZNF804A alterations in 
symptoms improvement after treatment. Both manic and depressive symptoms seem to 
be modulated by ZNF804A, though the latter was observed in the bipolar pooled 
sample only. The role of this factor is likely related to synaptic development 
and maintenance; however, further analyses will be needed to better understand 
the molecular mechanics involved with ZNF804A.
