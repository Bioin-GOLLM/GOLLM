Background: Pre-surgical simulation-based training with three-dimensional (3D) 
models has been intensively developed in complex surgeries in recent years. This 
is also the case in liver surgery, although with fewer reported examples. The 
simulation-based training with 3D models represents an alternative to current 
surgical simulation methods based on animal or ex vivo models or virtual reality 
(VR), showing reported advantages, which makes the development of realistic 
3D-printed models an option. This work presents an innovative, low-cost approach 
for producing patient-specific 3D anatomical models for hands-on simulation and 
training. Methods: The article reports three paediatric cases presenting complex 
liver tumours that were transferred to a major paediatric referral centre for 
treatment: hepatoblastoma, hepatic hamartoma and biliary tract rhabdomyosarcoma. 
The complete process of the additively manufactured liver tumour simulators is 
described, and the different steps for the correct development of each case are 
explained: (1) medical image acquisition; (2) segmentation; (3) 3D printing; (4) 
quality control/validation; and (5) cost. A digital workflow for liver cancer 
surgical planning is proposed. Results: Three hepatic surgeries were planned, 
with 3D simulators built using 3D printing and silicone moulding techniques. The 
3D physical models showed highly accurate replications of the actual condition. 
Additionally, they proved to be more cost-effective in comparison with other 
models. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture 
accurate and cost-effective 3D-printed soft surgical planning simulators for 
treating liver cancer. The 3D models allowed for proper pre-surgical planning 
and simulation training in the three cases reported, making it a valuable aid 
for surgeons.
