Wnt signaling was initially recognized to be vital for tissue development and 
homeostasis maintenance. Further studies revealed that this pathway is also 
important for tumorigenesis and progression. Abnormal expression of signaling 
components through gene mutation or epigenetic regulation is closely associated 
with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several tissues. Additionally, Wnt 
signaling also influences the tumor microenvironment and immune response. Some 
strategies and drugs have been proposed to target this pathway, such as blocking 
receptors/ligands, targeting intracellular molecules, beta-catenin/TCF4 complex 
and its downstream target genes, or tumor microenvironment and immune response. 
Here we discuss the roles of these components in Wnt signaling pathway in 
tumorigenesis and cancer progression, the underlying mechanisms that is 
responsible for the activation of Wnt signaling, and a series of drugs targeting 
the Wnt pathway provide multiple therapeutic values. Although some of these 
drugs exhibit exciting anti-cancer effect, clinical trials and systematic 
evaluation should be strictly performed along with multiple-omics technology.
