The activation of human complement component C5 by a fluid phase C5 convertase.

DiScipio RG, Smith CA, Muller-Eberhard HJ, Hugli TE.

Complement component C5 is converted to C5a and C5b by the cobra venom 
factor-dependent C3/C5 convertase CVF,Bb (EC 3.4.21.47). The C5 convertase 
produces selective proteolytic cleavage of an arginyl-leucine peptide bond at 
positions 74-75 in the alpha chain of C5. Circular dichroism studies in both the 
far and near UV regions provide evidence that a conformational change 
accompanies the C5 activation process. When C5 is activated by CVF,Bb in the 
presence of complement component C6, the C5b,6 complex is formed. However, when 
C6 is added after C5 has been converted to C5b, the C5b,6 complex fails to form. 
Therefore, the activation of C5 results in a transient binding site for C6. 
Hydrophobic sites are probably exposed upon C5 activation because C5b undergoes 
aggregation when C5 is converted to C5b in the absence of C6. Transmission 
electron micrographs of the C5 molecule indicate a multilobal, irregular 
ultrastructure with estimated dimensions of 104 X 140 X 168 A. Aggregated C5b 
has the appearance of globular particles with a diameter range of 350-700 A. 
Although C5 shares a number of features with the third component of complement, 
including a similar ultrastructure and partial sequence homology, C5 is devoid 
of the unusual thiol ester linkage found in C3. It is the labile thiol ester 
that permits covalent attachment between C3 and nucleophilic acceptors. In 
contrast, interactions between C5 and C6 or C5 and membranes remain noncovalent.
