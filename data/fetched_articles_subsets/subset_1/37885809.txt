INTRODUCTION: Pervious studies reported the association of TTF-1 expression with 
the efficacy of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in combination with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Nevertheless, the 
predictive value of extent of TTF-1 expression (diffuse or focal TTF-1 
positivity) remains unclear.
METHODS: The present study retrospectively reviewed 74 patients with 
TTF-1-positive recurrent or advanced nonsquamous NSCLC receiving first-line 
chemoimmunotherapy in a single institution in Japan. TTF-1 expression score in 
pretreatment tumor specimens was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and the 
impact of chemoimmunotherapy response was analyzed.
RESULTS: In the total cohort, ≥50% of the tumor cells were TTF-1 positive (i.e., 
diffusely TTF-1 positive) in specimens of 61 patients (82.4%), whereas 10% to 
49% of the tumor cells were TTF-1 positive (i.e., focally TTF-1 positive) in 
specimens of the remaining 13 patients (17.6%). In multivariate analysis, the 
median progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were significantly 
longer in patients with diffusely TTF-1-positive tumors than in those with 
focally TTF-1-positive tumors (14.2 versus 9.2 mo, p = 0.01 and 30.2 versus 17.3 
mo, p = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the median OS was significantly longer in 
patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy including pemetrexed than in those 
receiving chemoimmunotherapy not including pemetrexed among the patients with 
diffusely TTF-1-positive tumors (not attained versus 23.2 mo, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The positive extent of diffuse TTF-1 expression associated with 
patient outcome was an independent predictive factor for better progression-free 
survival and OS in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC receiving 
chemoimmunotherapy.
