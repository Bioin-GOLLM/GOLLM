The degradation of misfolded secretory proteins is ultimately mediated by the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytoplasm, therefore endoplasmic 
reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates must be dislocated across the 
ER membrane through a process driven by the AAA ATPase p97/VCP. Derlins recruit 
p97/VCP and have been proposed to be part of the dislocation machinery. Here we 
report that Derlins are inactive members of the rhomboid family of intramembrane 
proteases and bind p97/VCP through C-terminal SHP boxes. Human Derlin-1 
harboring mutations within the rhomboid domain stabilized mutant α-1 antitrypsin 
(NHK) at the cytosolic face of the ER membrane without disrupting the p97/VCP 
interaction. We propose that substrate interaction and p97/VCP recruitment are 
separate functions that are essential for dislocation and can be assigned 
respectively to the rhomboid domain and the C terminus of Derlin-1. These data 
suggest that intramembrane proteolysis and protein dislocation share unexpected 
mechanistic features.
