BACKGROUND: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a mast cell neoplasm in which 
neoplastic cells usually display the D816V-mutated variant of KIT. Cladribine 
(2CdA) and dasatinib are two drugs that counteract the in vitro growth of 
neoplastic mast cells in SM. However, only little is known about the in vivo 
effects of these drugs in SM.
PATIENT AND METHODS: We report on a patient with highly aggressive 
interferon-alpha-resistant SM who was treated with 2CdA and dasatinib. In vitro 
pretesting revealed a response of neoplastic mast cells to both compounds with 
reasonable IC(50) values.
RESULTS: The patient was treated with six cycles of 2CdA (0.13 mg kg(-1) 
intravenously daily on 5 consecutive days). Despite a short-lived major clinical 
response and a decrease in serum tryptase, the patient progressed to mast cell 
leukaemia after the sixth cycle of 2CdA. The patient then received two further 
courses of 2CdA followed by treatment with dasatinib (100 mg per os daily). 
However, no major response was obtained and the patient died from disease 
progression after 2 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In a patient with rapidly progressing aggressive SM, neither 2CdA 
nor dasatinib produced a long-lasting response in vivo, despite encouraging in 
vitro results. For such patients, alternative treatment strategies have to be 
developed.
