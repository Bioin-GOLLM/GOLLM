Data from animal studies and from genetic scans in humans suggest that 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophic factor 
family, may be involved in the mechanisms underlying substance abuse. The 
present study tested the hypothesis that the BDNF-gene Val66Met polymorphism is 
associated with substance abuse. We studied this polymorphism in 103 
methamphetamine- and 200 heroin-dependent cases and 122 normal controls. We also 
considered the association of this polymorphism with age of onset of substance 
abuse in the heroin-dependent cases. Significant differences in BDNF Val66Met 
genotype distribution were found between subjects dependent on methamphetamine 
(P = 0.046) or heroin (P = 0.045) and controls, suggesting that the lower 66Met 
carrier frequency is associated with substance abuse. Furthermore, in the 
heroin-dependent group, the Val/Val homozygotes had a later onset of substance 
abuse compared with the Met allele carriers. The results suggest that the BDNF 
Val66Met polymorphism or a nearby locus may be involved in the pathogenesis of 
substance abuse. Our findings support previous genetic scan results showing that 
BDNF may contribute to substance abuse vulnerability.
