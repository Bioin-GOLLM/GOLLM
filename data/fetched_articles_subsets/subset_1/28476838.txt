BACKGROUND: Taxanes are widely used to treat breast cancer patients. Taxanes are 
metabolized in human liver by the cytochrome CYP3A and are substrate of 
ATP-binding cassette multidrug transporters ABCB1. Single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in taxanes' metabolism could affect the 
inter-individual variability in reported toxicities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 152 women, affected by 
breast cancer and receiving a taxane-based chemotherapy, were enrolled. A 
peripheral blood sample was taken for genotyping the following polymorphisms: 
CYP3A4* 1B (A>G), CYP3A5 *3 (G>A) and ABCB1 (C1236T; C3435T).
RESULTS: We observed an association between ABCB1 3435 T/T and lower grade of 
toxicities (p=0.05). No other association were found for CYP 3A4 *1B, 3A5*3 and 
ABCB1 C1236T.
CONCLUSION: ABCB1 3435 T/T seems to be associated to lower rate of toxicity in 
patients receiving taxanes. Further prospective and larger studies should be 
performed to clarify the role of this polymorphism.
