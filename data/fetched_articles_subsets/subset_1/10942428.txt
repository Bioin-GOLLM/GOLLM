Peroxisome biogenesis disorders, of which 13 complementation groups have been 
identified, are subdivided with regard to two major dysfunctions: peroxisomal 
matrix protein import and peroxisomal membrane synthesis. Detectable remnant 
membrane structures are evident only in the former. Molecular defects have been 
defined in 10 PEX genes, including eight related to protein import and two to 
membrane synthesis. We now have evidence that the human complete cDNA encoding 
Pex3p, a peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) factor for the proper localization 
of PMPs, rescues the import of both PMP and the matrix protein in fibroblasts 
from a Zellweger syndrome patient of complementation group G. This patient was 
homozygous for a 1 base insertion in the codon for V182, which resulted in a 
change of codon (182-183) and introduced a termination codon (184), which 
inactivated PMP and matrix protein import by Pex3p. A PEX3-defective CHO mutant 
clone, ZPG208, was of the same complementation group as group G.
