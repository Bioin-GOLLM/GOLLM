Substantial evidence indicates that neuroinflammation caused by microglial 
activation in substantia nigra is critical in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic 
neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Increasing data demonstrates that 
environmental factors such as rotenone, paraquat play pivotal roles in 
dopaminergic neuron death. Here, potential role and mechanism of neuromelanin 
(NM), a major endogenous component in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra, 
on microglial activation and associated dopaminergic neurotoxicity were 
investigated. Using multiple primary mesencephalic cultures, we found that HNM 
caused dopaminergic neurodegeneration characterized by the decreased dopamine 
uptake and reduced numbers and shorted dendrites. HNM was selectively toxic to 
dopaminergic neurons since the other types of neurons determined by either 
gamma-aminobutyric acid uptake and total neuronal numbers showed smaller 
decrease. HNM produced modest dopaminergic neurotoxicity in neuron-enriched 
cultures; in contrast, much greater neurotoxicity was observed in the presence 
of microglia. HNM morphologically activated microglia and produced 
proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors. Thus, HNM can be a potent endogenous 
activator of microglial reactivation, mediating PD progression. Hence, 
inhibition of microglial reactivation can be a useful strategy for PD therapy.
