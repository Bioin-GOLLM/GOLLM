The title compound, C(17)H(12)N(2)O, was synthesized by an ether synthesis from 
quinolin-6-ol and 4-(bromo-meth-yl)benzonitrile. The phenyl ring of the 
benzonitrile group makes a dihedral angle of 47.52 (6)° with the plane of the 
quinoline fragment. The crystal structure is stabilized by inter-molecular C-H⋯π 
inter-actions between a benzene H atom of the benzonitrile group and the benzene 
ring of the quinoline fragment. In addition, the crystal structure also exhibits 
a weak inter-molecular C-H⋯N hydrogen bond.
