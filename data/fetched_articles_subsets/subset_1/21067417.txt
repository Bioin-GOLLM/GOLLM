To test the efficacy of RNA interference (RNAi) as a method for target-site 
screening in Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleptera: Chrysomelidae) 
larvae, genes were identified and tested for which clear RNAi phenotypes had 
been identified in the Coleopteran model, Tribolium castaneum. Here the cloning 
of the D. v. vergifera orthologs of laccase 2 (DvvLac2) and chitin synthase 2 
(DvvCHS2) is reported. Injection of DvvLac2-specific double-stranded RNA 
resulted in prevention of post-molt cuticular tanning, while injection of 
DvvCHS2-specific dsRNA reduced chitin levels in midguts. Silencing of both 
DvvLac2 and DvvCHS2 was confirmed by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR. As in T. 
castaneum, RNAi-mediated gene silencing is systemic in Diabrotica. The results 
indicate that RNAi-induced silencing of D. v. vergifera genes provides a 
powerful tool for identifying potential insecticide targets.
