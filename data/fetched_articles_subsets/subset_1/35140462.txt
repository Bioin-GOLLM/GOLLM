PURPOSE: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are natural biocarriers for 
biomolecule transfer between cells and promising therapeutic strategies for bone 
defect repair. In this study, human periodontal ligament stem cell 
(PDLSC)-derived sEVs (P-EVs) were immobilized in Matrigel to establish a topical 
cell-free transplantation strategy for bone repair.
METHODS: PDLSCs were cultured and P-EVs were isolated from the culture 
supernatant. In a rat bilateral calvarial defect model, P-EV/Matrigel was 
plugged into one defect and PBS/Matrigel was applied to the other. Bone repair 
in vivo was assessed by micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry, and 
immunohistochemical staining. In vitro, we investigated the effects of P-EVs on 
the proliferation and migration capabilities of bone marrow mesenchymal stem 
cells (BMMSCs) and explored the potential mechanism of action.
RESULTS: The in vivo study showed that P-EV/Matrigel accelerated bone tissue 
repair by increasing cell infiltration when compared with the control. In vitro, 
P-EVs enhanced proliferation and migration of BMMSCs via increased 
phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). 
The role of P-EV-induced adenosine receptor signaling in AKT and ERK1/2 
phosphorylation was a key mediator during enhanced BMMSC migration.
CONCLUSION: These results are the first to demonstrate that P-EVs accelerated 
the repair of bone defects, partially through promoting cell proliferation and 
migration. P-EV/Matrigel, which combines topical EV-implantation and 
extracellular matrix scaffolds, provides a new cell-free strategy for bone 
tissue repair.
