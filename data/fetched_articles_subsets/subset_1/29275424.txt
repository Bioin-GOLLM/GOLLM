BACKGROUND Long non-coding RNA PCAT7 has been revealed to participate in 
tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, the mechanism of PCAT7 in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been identified. Hence, this study aimed to 
determine the function of PCAT7 in NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression 
level of PCAT7 in 96 pairs of NSCLC tissues and 6 cell lines was detected by 
qRT-PCR. Proliferation assay, flow cytometric analysis, transwell/migration 
assay, and Western blotting assay were performed to detect the relation between 
PCAT7 and malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells in vitro, including cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT). Rescue assays were carried out to confirm the contribution of 
PCAT7 to the progression of NSCLC cells by targeting miR-134-5p. RESULTS PCAT7 
was found to be overexpressed in NSCLC tissues (compared with corresponding 
non-tumor tissues) and NSCLC cells (compared with normal cell line 16-HBE). 
Overexpression of PCAT7 resulted in the promotion of tumor cell proliferation, 
inhibition of cells apoptosis, facilitation of cells metastasis, and formation 
of EMT phenotype, while PCAT7 expression deletion remarkably prohibited cell 
proliferation, accelerated their apoptosis, weakened metastasis, and reversed 
EMT to MET. miR-134-5P, as a target gene of PCAT7, restored the effects of 
down-regulation of PCAT7. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that PCAT7 
participates in tumor progression in NSCLC by inhibiting miR-134-5p.
