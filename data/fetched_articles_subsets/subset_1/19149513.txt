Periodontal disease initiation and progression occurs as a consequence of the 
host immune inflammatory response to oral pathogens. The innate and acquired 
immune systems are critical for the proper immune response. LPS, an outer 
membrane constituent of periodontal pathogenic bacteria, stimulates the 
production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-6 and RANKL either 
directly or indirectly. In LPS-stimulated cells, the induction of cytokine 
expression requires activation of several signaling pathways including the p38 
MAPK pathway. This review will discuss the significance of the p38 MAPK pathway 
in periodontal disease progression and the potential therapeutic consequences of 
pharmacological antagonism of this pathway in the treatment of periodontal 
diseases.
