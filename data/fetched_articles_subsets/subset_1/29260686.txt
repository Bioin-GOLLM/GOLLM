During December 2016-February 2017, influenza A viruses of the H7N2 subtype 
infected â‰ˆ500 cats in animal shelters in New York, NY, USA, indicating virus 
transmission among cats. A veterinarian who treated the animals also became 
infected with feline influenza A(H7N2) virus and experienced respiratory 
symptoms. To understand the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these feline 
H7N2 viruses in mammals, we characterized them in vitro and in vivo. Feline H7N2 
subtype viruses replicated in the respiratory organs of mice, ferrets, and cats 
without causing severe lesions. Direct contact transmission of feline H7N2 
subtype viruses was detected in ferrets and cats; in cats, exposed animals were 
also infected via respiratory droplet transmission. These results suggest that 
the feline H7N2 subtype viruses could spread among cats and also infect humans. 
Outbreaks of the feline H7N2 viruses could, therefore, pose a risk to public 
health.
