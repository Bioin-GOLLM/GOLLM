A critical overview of current approaches to the development of 
starch-containing packaging, integrating the principles of green chemistry (GC), 
green technology (GT) and green nanotechnology (GN) with those of green 
packaging (GP) to produce materials important for both us and the planet is 
given. First, as a relationship between GP and GC, the benefits of natural 
bioactive compounds are analyzed and the state-of-the-art is updated in terms of 
the starch packaging incorporating green chemicals that normally help us to 
maintain health, are environmentally friendly and are obtained via GC. Newer 
approaches are identified, such as the incorporation of vitamins or minerals 
into films and coatings. Second, the relationship between GP and GT is assessed 
by analyzing the influence on starch films of green physical treatments such as 
UV, electron beam or gamma irradiation, and plasma; emerging research areas are 
proposed, such as the use of cold atmospheric plasma for the production of 
films. Thirdly, the approaches on how GN can be used successfully to improve the 
mechanical properties and bioactivity of packaging are summarized; current 
trends are identified, such as a green synthesis of bionanocomposites containing 
phytosynthesized metal nanoparticles. Last but not least, bioinspiration ideas 
for the design of the future green packaging containing starch are presented.
