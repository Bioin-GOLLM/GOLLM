Two novel frameshift mutations were detected in the mutant LDL receptor genes 
responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia. One was a 5-bp insertion at codon 
395 in exon 9, and the other was a one nucleotide deletion at codon 531 in exon 
11. Both mutations alter the reading frame and consequently produce a premature 
stop codon in the region of the mature LDL receptor homologous to the epidermal 
growth factor (EGF) precursor. With regard to the mechanism responsible for the 
generation of these frameshift mutations, strand slipped mispairing mediated by 
short direct repeats is considered to be the most likely. The findings seem to 
support the hypothesis that a short direct repeat in DNA sequence can have a 
profound influence on the stability of a given gene and promote human gene 
mutations.
