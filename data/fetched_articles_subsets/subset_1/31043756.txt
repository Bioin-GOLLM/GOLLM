Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder. We performed a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 20,352 cases and 31,358 controls 
of European descent, with follow-up analysis of 822 variants with P < 1 × 10-4 
in an additional 9,412 cases and 137,760 controls. Eight of the 19 variants that 
were genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10-8) in the discovery GWAS were not 
genome-wide significant in the combined analysis, consistent with small effect 
sizes and limited power but also with genetic heterogeneity. In the combined 
analysis, 30 loci were genome-wide significant, including 20 newly identified 
loci. The significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels, neurotransmitter 
transporters and synaptic components. Pathway analysis revealed nine 
significantly enriched gene sets, including regulation of insulin secretion and 
endocannabinoid signaling. Bipolar I disorder is strongly genetically correlated 
with schizophrenia, driven by psychosis, whereas bipolar II disorder is more 
strongly correlated with major depressive disorder. These findings address key 
clinical questions and provide potential biological mechanisms for bipolar 
disorder.
