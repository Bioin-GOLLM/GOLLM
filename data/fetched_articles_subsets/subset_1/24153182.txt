Transcription of ribosomal RNA by RNA polymerase (Pol) I initiates ribosome 
biogenesis and regulates eukaryotic cell growth. The crystal structure of Pol I 
from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2.8 Å resolution reveals all 
14 subunits of the 590-kilodalton enzyme, and shows differences to Pol II. An 
'expander' element occupies the DNA template site and stabilizes an expanded 
active centre cleft with an unwound bridge helix. A 'connector' element invades 
the cleft of an adjacent polymerase and stabilizes an inactive polymerase dimer. 
The connector and expander must detach during Pol I activation to enable 
transcription initiation and cleft contraction by convergent movement of the 
polymerase 'core' and 'shelf' modules. Conversion between an inactive expanded 
and an active contracted polymerase state may generally underlie transcription. 
Regulatory factors can modulate the core-shelf interface that includes a 
'composite' active site for RNA chain initiation, elongation, proofreading and 
termination.
