Phot proteins are homologs of the blue-light receptor phototropin. We report a 
comparative study of the photocycles of the isolated, light-sensitive domains 
LOV1 and LOV2 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii phot protein, as well as the 
construct LOV1/2 containing both domains. Transient absorption measurements 
revealed a short lifetime of the LOV2-wt triplet state (500 ns), but a long 
lifetime (287 micros) of the triplet in the mutant LOV2-C250S, in which the 
reactive cysteine is replaced by serine. For LOV1, in comparison, corresponding 
numbers of 800 ns and 4 micros for the two conformers in LOV1-wt, and 27 micros 
for LOV1-C57S have been reported. The triplet decay kinetics in the mixed 
domains LOV1/2-wt, LOV1/2-C57S, and LOV1/2-C250S can be analyzed as the 
superposition of the behavior of the corresponding single domains. The situation 
is different for the slow, thermal reaction of the photoadduct back to the dark 
form. Whereas the individual domains LOV1 and LOV2 show two decay components, 
the double domains LOV1/2-C57S and LOV1/2-C250S both show only a single 
component. The interaction of the two domains does therefore not manifest itself 
during the lifetime of the triplet states, but changes the decay behavior of the 
adduct states.
