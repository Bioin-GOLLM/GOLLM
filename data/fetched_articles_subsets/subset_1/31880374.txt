SEPT12 is a testis-specific gene involved in the terminal differentiation of 
male germ cells. SEPT12 protein is required for sperm head-tail formation and 
acts as a fundamental constituent of sperm tail annulus. In this study, we 
screened genetic variations in exons 5, 6, 7 of the SEPT12 and assessed the 
annulus status in teratozoospermic, globozoospermic, and patients with immotile 
short tail sperm. DNA sequencing was performed for 90 teratozoospermic and 30 
normozoospermic individuals. Immunocytochemistry, transmission electron 
microscopy and western blotting were conducted to evaluate annulus status and 
the expression level of SEPT12 in patients with a distinct exonic variation 
(c.474G>A), respectively. Five polymorphisms identified within the desired 
regions of the SEPT12, among them c.474G>A had the potential to induce aberrant 
splicing results in the expression of a truncated protein. The annulus was 
detected in most of the spermatozoa from teratozoospermic and normozoospermic 
men with c.474G>A. In contrast, in the patient with short tail sperm defect 
carrying c.474G>A, 99% of spermatozoa were devoid of the annulus. Based on our 
findings there would be no association between exons 5, 6, 7 polymorphisms of 
the SEPT12 gene and the occurrence of mentioned disease but c.474G>A would be a 
predisposing factor in male infertility.
