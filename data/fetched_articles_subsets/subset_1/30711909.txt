Cholinergic signaling in the cortex involves fast or transient signaling as well 
as a relatively slower neuromodulatory component. These two components of 
cholinergic activity mediate separate yet interacting aspects of cue detection 
and attentional control. The transient component appears to support the 
activation of cue-associated task or response sets, whereas the slower 
modulatory component stabilizes task-set and context representations, therefore 
potentially facilitating top-down control. Evidence from humans expressing 
genetic variants of the choline transporter as well as from patients with 
degenerating cholinergic systems supports the hypothesis that attentional 
control capacities depend on levels of cholinergic neuromodulation. Deficits in 
cholinergic-attentional control impact diverse cognitive functions, including 
timing, working memory, and complex movement control.
