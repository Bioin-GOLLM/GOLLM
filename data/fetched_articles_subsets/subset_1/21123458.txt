BACKGROUND: Homozygosity for the variant 677T allele in the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene increases the requirement for 
folate and may alter the metabolic use of choline. The choline adequate intake 
is 550 mg/d for men, although the metabolic consequences of consuming extra 
choline are unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Deuterium-labeled choline (d9-choline) as tracer was used to 
determine the differential effects of the MTHFR C677T genotype and the effect of 
various choline intakes on the isotopic enrichment of choline derivatives in 
folate-compromised men.
DESIGN: Mexican American men with the MTHFR 677CC or 677TT genotype consumed a 
diet providing 300 mg choline/d plus supplemental choline chloride for total 
choline intakes of 550 (n = 11; 4 with 677CC and 7 with 677TT) or 1100 (n = 12; 
4 with 677CC and 8 with 677TT) mg/d for 12 wk. During the last 3 wk, 15% of the 
total choline intake was provided as d9-choline.
RESULTS: Low but measurable enrichments of the choline metabolites were 
achieved, including that of d3-phosphatidylcholine (d3-PtdCho)--a metabolite 
produced in the de novo pathway via choline-derived methyl groups. Men with the 
MTHFR 677TT genotype had a higher urinary enrichment ratio of betaine to choline 
(P = 0.041), a higher urinary enrichment of sarcosine (P = 0.041), and a greater 
plasma enrichment ratio of d9-betaine to d9-PtdCho with the 1100 mg choline/d 
intake (P = 0.033).
CONCLUSION: These data show for the first time in humans that choline itself is 
a source of methyl groups for de novo PtdCho biosynthesis and indicate that the 
MTHFR 677TT genotype favors the use of choline as a methyl donor.
