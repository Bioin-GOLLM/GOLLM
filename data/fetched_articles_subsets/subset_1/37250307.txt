Accumulating evidence indicates that long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) 
show more tissue-specific expression patterns than protein-coding genes (PCGs). 
However, although lincRNAs are subject to canonical transcriptional regulation 
like PCGs, the molecular basis for the specificity of their expression patterns 
remains unclear. Here, using expression data and coordinates of topologically 
associating domains (TADs) in human tissues, we show that lincRNA loci are 
significantly enriched in the more internal region of TADs compared to PCGs and 
that lincRNAs within TADs have higher tissue specificity than those outside 
TADs. Based on these, we propose an analytical framework to interpret 
transcriptional status using lincRNA as an indicator. We applied it to 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy data and found disease-specific transcriptional 
regulation: ectopic expression of keratin at the TAD level and derepression of 
myocyte differentiation-related genes by E2F1 with down-regulation of LINC00881. 
Our results provide understanding of the function and regulation of lincRNAs 
according to genomic structure.
