In mammalian transcriptomes approximately 25% of 5' ends determined by Capped 
Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) map to locations within spliced exons. The 
current study sought to determine if the cytoplasmic capping complex 
participates in generating these downstream CAGE tags. 5'-RACE was used to 
amplify the uncapped ends of target transcripts that accumulate when cytoplasmic 
capping is blocked. Sequencing of these RACE products mapped the positions of 
uncapped ends either exactly to or just downstream of archived CAGE tags. These 
findings support a role for cytoplasmic capping in generating the downstream 
capped ends identified by CAGE.
