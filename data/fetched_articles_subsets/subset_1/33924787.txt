Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder that is highly 
comorbid with mental disorders. However, few studies have examined the risk of 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 
bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia in the 
offspring of parents with IBS. We used nationally representative cross-sectional 
survey data to analyze cross-generational transmission patterns of both IBS and 
major mental disorders. Odds ratio (OR) was calculated by using logistic 
regression models with adjustment for potential confounding factors. Offspring 
of parents with IBS were more likely to develop IBS themselves (OR = 2.41, 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 2.09-2.78), ADHD (OR = 1.33, 95% CI, 1.08-1.62), and 
MDD (OR = 1.32, 95% CI, 1.04-1.68) than the controls. Data stratification by 
parental sex revealed that paternal IBS increased risk of ADHD (OR = 1.34, 95% 
CI, 1.01-1.77) in the offspring, while maternal IBS increased the risk of MDD 
(OR = 1.51, 95% CI, 1.11-2.06). This is the first study to reveal parental IBS 
is associated with IBS, ADHD, and MDD among offspring, suggesting the necessity 
for early implementation of prevention strategies for at-risk children.
