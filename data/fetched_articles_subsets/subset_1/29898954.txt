Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) is caused by dominant alleles of the 
mitochondrial pro-fusion factor Mitofusin 2 (MFN2). To address the consequences 
of these mutations on mitofusin activity and neuronal function, we generate 
Drosophila models expressing in neurons the two most frequent substitutions 
(R94Q and R364W, the latter never studied before) and two others localizing to 
similar domains (T105M and L76P). All alleles trigger locomotor deficits 
associated with mitochondrial depletion at neuromuscular junctions, decreased 
oxidative metabolism and increased mtDNA mutations, but they differently alter 
mitochondrial morphology and organization. Substitutions near or within the 
GTPase domain (R94Q, T105M) result in loss of function and provoke aggregation 
of unfused mitochondria. In contrast, mutations within helix bundle 1 (R364W, 
L76P) enhance mitochondrial fusion, as demonstrated by the rescue of 
mitochondrial alterations and locomotor deficits by over-expression of the 
fission factor DRP1. In conclusion, we show that both dominant negative and 
dominant active forms of mitofusin can cause CMT2A-associated defects and 
propose for the first time that excessive mitochondrial fusion drives CMT2A 
pathogenesis in a large number of patients.
