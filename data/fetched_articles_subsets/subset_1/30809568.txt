Low-grade serous ovarian cancer represents a minority of ovarian cancers and has 
distinctive features from high grade epithelial ovarian cancer. While less 
aggressive, in advanced stage they can be poorly chemo-responsive and incur a 
treatment challenge. Next generation sequencing of tumors has allowed for the 
potential for targeted therapy in cancer treatment, which can allow for 
avoidance of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We present a case of a 56â€¯year 
old female with advanced recurrent low grade serous ovarian cancer found to have 
NRAS mutation who underwent targeted therapy with trametinib with immediate and 
sustained disease response. We review the response and toxicity experienced by 
the patient, as well as treatment for her toxicity.
