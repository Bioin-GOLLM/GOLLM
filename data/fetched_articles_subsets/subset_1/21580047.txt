In the title compound, C(15)H(10)BrClO, the dihedral angle between mean planes 
of the bromo- and chloro-substituted benzene rings is 46.2 (2)° compared to 
45.20 (9)° in the structure with the Cl substituent in the meta position of the 
aromatic ring. The dihedral angles between the mean plane of the 
prop-2-ene-1-one group and the mean planes of the 4-bromo-phenyl and 
3-chloro-phenyl rings are 28.7 (5) and 24.2 (4)°, respectively. In the crystal, 
weak inter-molecular C-H⋯π inter-actions occur.
