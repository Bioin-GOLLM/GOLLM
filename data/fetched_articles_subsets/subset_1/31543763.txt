Neurological disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease 
(PD), which were caused by abnormalities in the nervous system involves the 
accumulation of false proteins, neurotransmitter abnormalities, neuronal 
apoptosis, etc. As an alternative supplementary medicine (ASM), acupuncture 
plays an important role in the treatment of neurological diseases. In this 
review article, we summarized the current evidence for the treatment efficacy of 
acupuncture in AD and PD from the perspective of clinical trials and animal 
model. Acupuncture can inhibit the accumulation of toxic proteins in 
neurological diseases, modulate energy supply based on glucose metabolism, 
depress neuronal apoptosis, etc., and exert a wide range of neuroprotective 
effects.
