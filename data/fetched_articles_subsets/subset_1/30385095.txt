Biallelic mutations in the IGHMBP2 have been associated with two distinct 
phenotypes: spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) 
and CMT2S. We describe a patient who developed progressive muscle weakness and 
wasting in her upper and lower limbs from infancy. She developed respiratory 
involvement at age 9, eventually requiring 24-h non-invasive ventilation, and 
severe autonomic dysfunction restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. 
Neurophysiological studies at age 27 years revealed absent sensory and motor 
responses and severe chronic denervation changes in proximal muscles of the 
upper limbs. Targeted multigene panel sequencing detected a novel homozygous 
missense variant in the IGHMBP2 gene (c.1325A > G; p.Tyr442Cys). This variant 
was validated by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis confirmed that 
both parents were asymptomatic heterozygous carriers. This case report confirms 
that IGHMBP2 related disorders can result in a severe peripheral neuropathy with 
gastrointestinal autonomic dysfunction requiring parenteral nutrition.
