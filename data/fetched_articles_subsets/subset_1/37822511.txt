Correlation between blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) has been used as an index of neurovascular coupling. Hippocampal BOLD-CBF 
correlation is associated with neurocognition, and the reduced correlation is 
associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. We conducted the first genome-wide 
association study of the hippocampal BOLD-CBF correlation in 4,832 Chinese Han 
subjects. The hippocampal BOLD-CBF correlation had an estimated heritability of 
16.2-23.9% and showed reliable genome-wide significant association with a locus 
at 3q28, in which many variants have been linked to neuroimaging and 
cerebrospinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's disease. Gene-based association 
analyses showed four significant genes (GMNC, CRTC2, DENND4B, and GATAD2B) and 
revealed enrichment for mast cell calcium mobilization, microglial cell 
proliferation, and ubiquitin-related proteolysis pathways that regulate 
different cellular components of the neurovascular unit. This is the first 
unbiased identification of the association of hippocampal BOLD-CBF correlation, 
providing fresh insights into the genetic architecture of hippocampal 
neurovascular coupling.
