The N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) ←forward genetic screen is a useful tool for the 
unbiased discovery of novel mechanisms regulating developmental processes. We 
recovered the dorothy mutation in such a screen designed to recover recessive 
mutations affecting craniofacial development in the mouse. Dorothy embryos die 
prenatally and exhibit many striking phenotypes commonly associated with 
ciliopathies, including a severe midfacial clefting phenotype. We used exome 
sequencing to discover a missense mutation in nucleotide binding protein 2 
(Nubp2) to be causative. This finding was confirmed by a complementation assay 
with the dorothy allele and an independent Nubp2 null allele (Nubp2null). We 
demonstrated that Nubp2 is indispensable for embryogenesis. NUBP2 is implicated 
in both the cytosolic iron/sulfur cluster assembly pathway and negative 
regulation of ciliogenesis. Conditional ablation of Nubp2 in the neural crest 
lineage with Wnt1-cre recapitulates the dorothy craniofacial phenotype. Using 
this model, we found that the proportion of ciliated cells in the craniofacial 
mesenchyme was unchanged, and that markers of the SHH, FGF, and BMP signaling 
pathways are unaltered. Finally, we show evidence that the phenotype results 
from a marked increase in apoptosis within the craniofacial mesenchyme.
