BACKGROUND: Women in Africa face disproportionate risk of human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) acquisition, accounting for more than half of new infections in 
Africa and similarly face a disproportionate burden of sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs). Very high STI prevalence is being observed globally, 
especially among people taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV 
prevention. Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (dPEP) has been proposed as an 
STI prevention strategy to reduce chlamydia, syphilis, and possibly gonorrhea, 
and trials are ongoing among cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and 
transgender women who are taking PrEP in high-income settings. We designed and 
describe here the first open-label trial to determine the effectiveness of dPEP 
to reduce STI incidence among cisgender women.
METHODS: We are conducting an open-label 1:1 randomized trial of dPEP versus 
standard of care (STI screening and treatment and risk-reduction counseling 
without dPEP) among 446 Kenyan women aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 years old women taking 
PrEP. Women are followed for 12 months, with quarterly STI testing, treatment, 
and adherence counseling. The primary trial outcome will be the combined 
incidence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Treponema 
pallidum, compared between the randomized groups. We will also assess dPEP 
acceptability, tolerability, safety, impact on sexual behavior, adherence, and 
occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in N. gonorrhoeae and C. 
trachomatis isolates. Finally, we will estimate cost per incident STI case and 
complications averted accounting for nonadherence and benefits relative AMR or 
side effects.
DISCUSSION: The results of this trial may have immediate implications for the 
global epidemic of STIs and sexual health. If effective, dPEP could put STI 
prevention into women's hands. While dPEP may be able to prevent STIs, it 
carries important risks that could counter its benefits; global debate about the 
balance of these potential risks and benefits requires data to inform policy and 
implementation and our study aims to fill this gap.
