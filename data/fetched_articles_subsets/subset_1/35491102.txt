The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
pandemic has threatened human health and the global economy. Development of 
additional vaccines and therapeutics is urgently required, but such development 
with live virus must be conducted with biosafety level 3 confinement. 
Pseudotyped viruses have been widely adopted for studies of virus entry and 
pharmaceutical development to overcome this restriction. Here we describe a 
modified protocol to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with 
SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in high yield. We found that a large 
proportion of pseudovirions produced with the conventional transient expression 
system lacked coronavirus spike protein at their surface as a result of 
inhibition of parental VSV infection by overexpression of this protein. 
Establishment of stable cell lines with an optimal expression level of 
coronavirus spike protein allowed the efficient production of progeny 
pseudoviruses decorated with spike protein. This improved VSV pseudovirus 
production method should facilitate studies of coronavirus entry and development 
of antiviral agents.Key words: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, pseudovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), spike 
protein.
