The structure of the title compound, C(15)H(21)N(3)O(6)·H(2)O, is of inter-est 
with respect to assumed anti-cancer activity. The title mol-ecules are linked 
through inter-molecular O-H⋯O hydrogen-bonded chains along the a axis. These 
chains are connected by inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds through the 
crystallographic screw axis along [010], forming layers, which are stabilized by 
other N-H⋯O bonds with water O atoms as acceptors and O-H⋯O bonds with water H 
atoms as donors. The H atoms of the protonated amino cation are also involved in 
inter-molecular N-H⋯O bonding inter-actions.
