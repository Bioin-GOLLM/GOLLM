BACKGROUND: The viral factors of hepatitis B virus (HBV), such as genotypes and 
mutations, were reported to affect the development of fulminant hepatitis B 
(FHB), but the mechanism is still unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate HBV mutations associated with FHB, especially in the 
subgenotype B1/Bj HBV (HBV/B1), which are known to cause FHB frequently in 
Japan.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 96 serum samples from acute self-limited hepatitis B 
(AHB) patients and 13 samples from FHB patients were used for 
full-genome/partial sequencing. A total of 107 chronic infection patients with 
HBV were also examined for the distribution of mutants.
RESULTS: In the analysis of full-genome sequences of HBV/B1 (FHB, n=11; non-FHB, 
n=35) including those from the databases, mutations at nt 1961 [T1961V (not T)] 
and nt 1962 [C1962D (not C)], which change S21 in the core protein, were found 
more frequently in FHB than in non-FHB (100% vs. 20%, 55% vs. 3%, respectively). 
When our FHB and AHB samples were compared, T1961V and C1962D were significantly 
more frequent in FHB than in AHB, both in the overall analysis (46% vs. 6%, 39% 
vs. 3%, respectively) and in HBV/B1 (100% vs. 29%, 100% vs. 14%, respectively). 
A newly developed PCR system detecting T1961V showed that HBV/B1 and low viral 
load were independent factors for the mutation among chronic infection patients.
CONCLUSIONS: T1961V/C1962D mutations were found frequently in FHB, especially in 
HBV/B1. The resulting S21 substitution in the core protein may play important 
roles in the development of FHB.
