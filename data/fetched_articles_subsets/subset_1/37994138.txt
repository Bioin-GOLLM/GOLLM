OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical phenotype and genetic variant in a child with 
Verheij syndrome (VRJS).
METHODS: A child who had presented at the Soochow University Affiliated 
Children's Hospital and Wujiang District Children's Hospital in July 2022 for 
"elevated scapula since early childhood" was selected as the study subject. 
Peripheral blood samples of the child and his parents were collected and 
subjected to whole exome sequencing. Candidate variant was verified by Sanger 
sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.
RESULTS: The child had manifested elevated scapulae, torticollis, neck 
asymmetry, facial dysmorphism, dispersed caf√©-au-lait spots, limited mobility of 
upper limbs and shoulder joints, and intellectual disability. Sequencing 
revealed that he has harbored a de novo heterozygous c.405dupT (p.Ile136Tyrfs*4) 
variant of the PUF60 gene. Based on the guidelines from the American College of 
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), this variant was classified as pathogenic 
(PVS1+PS2_moderate+PM2_supporting). Combined his clinical features and result of 
genetic testing, the child was diagnosed with VRJS due to variant of the PUF60 
gene.
CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of VRJS include facial dysmorphism, 
intellectual disability, elevated scapulae, vertebral fusion, other skeletal 
malformations, without significant abnormalities of the heart, kidney, and eyes, 
which need to be distinguished from Klippel-Feil syndrome. Above finding has 
expended the mutation spectrum of the PUF60 gene and provided a reference for 
delineation of the genotype-phenotype correlation of the VRJS.
