Astrocytes produce and release L-lactate as a potential source of energy for 
neurons. Here we present evidence that L-lactate, independently of its caloric 
value, serves as an astrocytic signalling molecule in the locus coeruleus (LC). 
The LC is the principal source of norepinephrine to the frontal brain and thus 
one of the most influential modulatory centers of the brain. Optogenetically 
activated astrocytes release L-lactate, which excites LC neurons and triggers 
release of norepinephrine. Exogenous L-lactate within the physiologically 
relevant concentration range mimics these effects. L-lactate effects are 
concentration-dependent, stereo-selective, independent of L-lactate uptake into 
neurons and involve a cAMP-mediated step. In vivo injections of L-lactate in the 
LC evokes arousal similar to the excitatory transmitter, L-glutamate. Our 
results imply the existence of an unknown receptor for this 'glio-transmitter'.
