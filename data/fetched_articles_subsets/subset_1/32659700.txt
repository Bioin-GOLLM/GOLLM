BACKGROUND: Interleukin 7 receptor (IL-7R) is a member of the type I cytokine 
receptor family, which affects the occurrence of various tumors by forming a 
signaling complex with its ligand Interleukin 7 (IL-7). This study aimed to 
explore the potential relationships of IL-7R polymorphisms with breast cancer 
susceptibility in the Chinese Han women.
METHODS: Five polymorphisms of IL-7R gene (rs969129, rs10213865, rs10053847, 
rs118137916, and rs6451231) form 553 patients and 550 healthy individuals among 
the Chinese Han women were genotyped using Agena MassARRAY platform. Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to evaluate the 
relationship.
RESULTS: The resulted of this study showed that rs10213865 was related to an 
increased breast cancer risk in allele (P = 0.045), dominant (P = 0.040), and 
log-additive (P = 0.029) models. As for rs969129, an increased risk of breast 
cancer was found in the allele (P = 0.018), co-dominant (P = 0.017), recessive 
(P = 0.034), and additive (P = 0.019) models. Rs6451231 was related to an 
increased risk of breast cancer under allele (P = 0.018), co-dominant 
(P = 0.021), and log-additive (P = 0.019) models. Age stratified analysis 
revealed that rs6451231 could enhance risk of breast cancer among the 
individuals older than 52 years. Furthermore, there was a significant 
correlation between haplotype Crs969129Grs10213865Ars10053847Grs118137916 and 
the decreased risk of breast cancer (P = 0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: This study firstly proved that IL-7R polymorphisms were 
significantly correlated with an increased susceptibility of breast cancer in 
the Chinese Han women.
