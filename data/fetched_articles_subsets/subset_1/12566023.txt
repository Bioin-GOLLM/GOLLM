PURPOSE: To report the prevalence of vitreous opacities and the outcome of 
vitreous surgery in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP).
DESIGN: Observational case series.
METHODS: In 37 patients with FAP and the ATTR Val30 Met mutation, vitreous 
opacities were present in 14 eyes of 9 patients and vitrectomy combined with 
phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation was performed in five eyes 
of three patients. In six patients with the ATTR Tyr114Cys mutation, vitreous 
opacities were present in both eyes of all six patients and vitrectomy combined 
with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation was performed in nine 
eyes of six patients. The mean follow-up period after vitreous surgery was 20.9 
+/- 16.8 months (range, 3 to 52 months).
RESULTS: The prevalence of vitreous opacities is much higher in patients with 
ATTR Tyr114Cys (100%) than in those with ATTR Val30 Met (24%). The mean age at 
the onset of vitreous opacities was significantly lower in the patients with 
ATTR Tyr114Cys (37.0 +/- 5.3 years) than in the nine patients with ATTR Val30 
Met (52.8 +/- 9.1 years; P <.005). Visual acuity improved in all 14 eyes after 
vitreous surgery; however, final visual acuity decreased in one eye owing to the 
occurrence of a central retinal vein occlusion. Vitreous opacities mildly 
increased in two eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the ATTR Val30 Met and ATTR Tyr114Cys 
mutations induce different clinical features of vitreous opacities. Vitreous 
surgery combined with phacoemulsification and implantation of an intraocular 
lens is a safe and useful treatment. Careful long-term follow-up should be 
performed.
