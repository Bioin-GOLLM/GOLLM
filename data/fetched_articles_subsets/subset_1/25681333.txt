Endosomal TLRs play an important role in systemic autoimmune diseases, such as 
systemic erythematosus lupus, in which DNA- and RNA-associated autoantigens 
activate autoreactive B cells through TLR9- and TLR7-dependent pathways. 
Nevertheless, TLR9-deficient autoimmune-prone mice develop more severe clinical 
disease, whereas TLR7-deficient and TLR7/9-double deficient autoimmune-prone 
mice develop less severe disease. To determine whether the regulatory activity 
of TLR9 is B cell intrinsic, we directly compared the functional properties of 
autoantigen-activated wild-type, TLR9-deficient, and TLR7-deficient B cells in 
an experimental system in which proliferation depends on BCR/TLR coengagement. 
In vitro, TLR9-deficient cells are less dependent on survival factors for a 
sustained proliferative response than are either wild-type or TLR7-deficient 
cells. The TLR9-deficient cells also preferentially differentiate toward the 
plasma cell lineage, as indicated by expression of CD138, sustained expression 
of IRF4, and other molecular markers of plasma cells. In vivo, 
autoantigen-activated TLR9-deficient cells give rise to greater numbers of 
autoantibody-producing cells. Our results identify distinct roles for TLR7 and 
TLR9 in the differentiation of autoreactive B cells that explain the capacity of 
TLR9 to limit, as well as TLR7 to promote, the clinical features of systemic 
erythematosus lupus.
