Aluminium hydroxide is a well-known adjuvant used in vaccines. Although it can 
enhance an adaptive immune response to a co-administered antigen, it causes 
adverse effects, including macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF), subcutaneous 
pseudolymphoma, and drug hypersensitivity. The object of this study is to 
demonstrate pediatric cases of aluminium hydroxide-induced diseases focusing on 
its rarity, under-recognition, and distinctive pathology. Seven child patients 
with biopsy-proven MMF were retrieved from the Seoul National University 
Hospital (SNUH) pathology archives from 2015 to 2019. The medical records and 
immunisation history were reviewed, and a full pathological muscle examination 
was carried out. The mean age was 1.7 years (8.9-40 months), who had records of 
vaccination against hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and tetanus toxoid on the 
quadriceps muscle. The chief complaints were muscle weakness (n = 6), delayed 
motor milestones (n = 6), instability, dysarthria, and involuntary movement 
(n = 1), swallowing difficulty (n = 1), high myopia (n = 1), and palpable 
subcutaneous nodules with skin papules (n = 1). Muscle biopsy showed MMF (n = 6) 
and pseudolymphoma (n = 1) with pathognomic basophilic large macrophage 
infiltration, which had distinctive spiculated inclusions on electron 
microscopy. The intracytoplasmic aluminium was positive for PAS and Morin 
stains. Distinctive pathology and ultrastructure suggested an association with 
aluminium hydroxide-containing vaccines. To avoid misdiagnosis and mistreatment, 
we must further investigate this uncommon condition, and pharmaceutical 
companies should attempt to formulate better adjuvants that do not cause such 
adverse effects.
