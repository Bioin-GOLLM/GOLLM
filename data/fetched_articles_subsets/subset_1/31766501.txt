The occurrence of optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) in children with 
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) still raises many questions regarding screening 
and surveillance because of the lack of robust prognostic factors. Recent 
studies of an overall cohort of 381 patients have suggested that the genotype 
may be the main determinant of the development of OPG, with the risk being 
higher in patients harbouring NF1 mutations in the 5' tertile and the 
cysteine/serine-rich domain. In an attempt to confirm this hypothesis, we used 
strict criteria to select a large independent cohort of 309 NF1 patients with 
defined constitutional NF1 mutations and appropriate brain images (255 directly 
enrolled and 54 as a result of a literature search). One hundred and thirty-two 
patients had OPG and 177 did not. The association of the position (tertiles and 
functional domains) and type of NF1 mutation with the development of OPG was 
analysed using the χ2 test and Fisher's exact probability test; odds ratios 
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and Bonferroni's correction 
for multiple comparisons was applied; multiple logistic regression was also used 
to study genotype-phenotype associations further. Our findings show no 
significant correlation between the site/type of NF1 mutation and the risk of 
OPG, and thus do not support the hypothesis that certain constitutional 
mutations provide prognostic information in this regard. In addition, we 
combined our cohort with a previously described cohort of 381 patients for a 
total of 690 patients and statistically re-analysed the results. The re-analysis 
confirmed that there were no correlations between the site (tertile and domain) 
and the risk of OPG, thus further strengthening our conclusions.
