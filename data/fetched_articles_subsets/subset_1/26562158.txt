BACKGROUND: Plants are unavoidably subjected to various abiotic stressors, 
including high salinity, drought and low temperature, which results in water 
deficit and even death. Water uptake and transportation play a critical role in 
response to these stresses. Many aquaporin proteins, localized at different 
tissues, function in various transmembrane water movements. We targeted at the 
key aquaporin in charge of both water uptake in roots and radial water 
transportation from vascular tissues through the whole plant.
RESULTS: The MzPIP2;1 gene encoding a plasma membrane intrinsic protein was 
cloned from salt-tolerant apple rootstock Malus zumi Mats. The GUS gene was 
driven by MzPIP2;1 promoter in transgenic Arabidopsis. It indicated that 
MzPIP2;1 might function in the epidermal and vascular cells of roots, parenchyma 
cells around vessels through the stems and vascular tissues of leaves. The 
ectopically expressed MzPIP2;1 conferred the transgenic Arabidopsis plants 
enhanced tolerance to slight salt and drought stresses, but sensitive to 
moderate salt stress, which was indicated by root length, lateral root number, 
fresh weight and K+/Na+ ratio. In addition, the possible key cis-elements in 
response to salt, drought and cold stresses were isolated by the promoter 
deletion experiment.
CONCLUSION: The MzPIP2;1 protein, as a PIP2 aquaporins subgroup member, involved 
in radial water movement, controls water absorption and usage efficiency and 
alters transgenic plants drought and salt tolerance.
