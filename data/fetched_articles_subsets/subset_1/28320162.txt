BACKGROUND: The rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213, a susceptibility variant 
for moyamoya disease (MMD), may be associated with non-MMD intracranial artery 
steno-occlusive disease of non-MMD type (non-MMD ICAD) in Asian. We investigated 
whether the rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213 affect the development of 
non-MMD ICAD in Koreans compared to MMD and control group.
METHODS: We included 31 patients with non-MMD ICAD, 25 patients with MMD, and 
100 participants as control group. The rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213 
was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of target and detection 
by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Clinical phenotype was 
compared between patients with and without the rs112735431 polymorphism in 
non-MMD ICAD and MMD.
RESULTS: The rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213 was significantly associated 
with non-MMD ICAD (p=0.001; odds ratio, 14.3; 95% confidence interval, 
2.80-73.2) and MMD (p<0.0001; odds ratio, 126.0; 95% confidence interval, 
24.2-656.0). The rate of hypertension was more frequent in MMD with the 
rs112735431 polymorphism than MMD without polymorphism (p=0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: The rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213 is highly associated not 
only with MMD but also with non-MMD ICAD in Koreans. Also, our study suggests 
that the rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213 may be linked to the 
hypertension in MMD. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship 
between the rs112735431 polymorphism of the RNF213 and hypertension in patients 
with MMD.
