Isolation and expression of an altered mouse dihydrofolate reductase cDNA.

Simonsen CC, Levinson AD.

We have constructed a cDNA library from a murine cell line expressing high 
levels of a dihydrofolate reductase (tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; 
5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) that displays an 
abnormally low affinity for methotrexate. From this library we have isolated a 
cDNA clone similar to, but distinguishable from, a cDNA clone previously 
demonstrated to encode the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence 
of this cDNA clone allows us to predict that the altered dihydrofolate reductase 
differs from the wild-type enzyme at a single amino acid, reflecting the 
substitution of an arginine for a leucine residue in a region of the polypeptide 
thought to form a hydrophobic pocket essential for inhibitor binding. To confirm 
that this substitution was responsible for the altered properties of the enzyme, 
we genetically localized the region of the cDNA that specified resistance to 
methotrexate by in vitro recombination. These results reveal that a single 
nucleotide change in the codon specifying amino acid 22 of the enzyme was 
sufficient to alter the methotrexate sensitivity of the enzyme. We demonstrate 
that this altered gene can be employed as a dominant selectable marker in 
cultured cells expressing normal levels of wild-type dihydrofolate reductase.
