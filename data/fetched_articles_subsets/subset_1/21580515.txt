The title compound, (C(12)H(16)N(2))(2)[PbBr(6)], is an organic-inorganic salt, 
with two doubly protonated N-(1-naphth-yl)ethyl-enediammonium cations and one 
octa-hedral hexa-bromidoplumbate(II) anion. The Pb(II) atom is located on a 
centre of inversion. The crystal structure consists of alternating inorganic and 
organic layers parallel to the bc plane. Face-to-face aromatic stacking 
inter-actions [centroid-centroid distance = 3.505 (5) Å] occur between parallel 
naphthalene systems in the organic layers, and N-H⋯Br hydrogen bonds between the 
cations and anions stabilize the crystal structure.
