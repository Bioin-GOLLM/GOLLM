microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in pancreas development and in 
regulation of insulin expression in the adult. Here we show that loss of miRNAs 
activity in beta-cells during embryonic development results in lower beta-cell 
mass and in impaired glucose tolerance. Dicer1-null cells initially constitute a 
significant portion of the total beta-cell population. However, during postnatal 
development, Dicer1-null cells are depleted. Furthermore, wild-type beta cells 
are repopulating the islets in complex compensatory dynamics. Because loss of 
Dicer1 is also associated with changes in the distribution of membranous 
E-cadherin, we hypothesized that E-cadherin activity may play a role in beta 
cell survival or islet architecture. However, genetic loss of E-cadherin 
function does not impair islet architecture, suggesting that miRNAs likely 
function through other or redundant effectors in the endocrine pancreas.
