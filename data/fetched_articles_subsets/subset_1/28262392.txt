An increasing number of biomolecular structures are solved by electron 
microscopy (EM). However, the quality of structure models determined from 
EM maps vary substantially. To understand to what extent structure models are 
supported by information embedded in EM maps, we used two computational 
structure refinement methods to examine how much structures can be refined using 
a dataset of 49 maps with accompanying structure models. The extent of structure 
modification as well as the disagreement between refinement models produced by 
the two computational methods scaled inversely with the global and the local map 
resolutions. A general quantitative estimation of deviations of structures for 
particular map resolutions are provided. Our results indicate that the observed 
discrepancy between the deposited map and the refined models is due to the lack 
of structural information present in EM maps and thus these annotations must be 
used with caution for further applications.
