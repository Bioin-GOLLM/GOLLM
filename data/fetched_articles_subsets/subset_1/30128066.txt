The first evidence of osimertinib resistance mediated by the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutation C797S was reported three years ago. Since then, 
no major breakthroughs have been achieved to target the clinically relevant 
mutant variant that impedes covalent bond formation with irreversible EGFR 
inhibitors. Although several biochemically active compounds have been described, 
only a few inhibitors that potently act on the cellular level or in vivo have 
been introduced so far. Herein, we give an overview of current approaches in the 
field and highlight the challenges that need to be addressed in future research 
projects to overcome the C797S-mediated drug resistance.
