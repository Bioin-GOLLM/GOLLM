The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 poses a great threat to human 
beings. Although numerous patients have recovered, re-positive cases have been 
reported in several countries. Till now, we still know very little about the 
disease and its pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, more attention should be paid to the following aspects, 
such as post-discharge surveillance, asymptomatic infection, re-evaluation of 
influenza-like symptoms, and dynamic monitoring of genomic mutation of 
SARS-CoV-2.
