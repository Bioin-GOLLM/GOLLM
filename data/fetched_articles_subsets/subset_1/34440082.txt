Childhood obesity could contribute to adulthood obesity, leading to adverse 
health outcomes in adults. However, the mechanisms for how obesity is developed 
are still unclear. To determine the epigenome-wide and genome-wide expression 
changes related with childhood obesity, we compared microRNome and transcriptome 
levels as well as leptin protein levels in whole bloods of 12 obese and 24 
normal children aged 6 years. miR-328-3p, miR-1301-3p, miR-4685-3p, and 
miR-6803-3p were negatively associated with all obesity indicators. The four 
miRNAs were also associated with 3948 mRNAs, and separate 475 mRNAs (185 among 
3948 mRNAs) were associated with all obesity indicators. The 2533 mRNAs (64.2%) 
among the 3948 mRNAs and 286 mRNAs (60.2%) among the 475 mRNAs were confirmed as 
targets of the four miRNAs in public databases through miRWalk 2.0. Leptin 
protein was associated with miR-6803-3p negatively and all obesity indicators 
positively. Using DAVID bioinformatics resources 6.8, top three pathways for 
obesity-related gene set were metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, and 
PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The top three obesity-related disease classes were 
metabolic, cardiovascular, and chemdependency. Our results support that 
childhood obesity could be developed through miRNAs-related epigenetic mechanism 
and, further, these obesity-related epigenetic changes could control the 
pathways related with the development of various diseases.
