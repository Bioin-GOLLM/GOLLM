Osteopontin (OPN) has been shown to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) progression; 
however, the mechanism of OPN-induced CRC progression is largely unknown. In 
this study, we found that OPN overexpression led to enhanced 
anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and invasion in KRAS gene mutant 
cells but to a lesser extent in KRAS wild-type cells. OPN overexpression also 
induced PI3K signalling, expression of Snail and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 
(MMP9), and suppressed the expression of E-cadherin in KRAS mutant cells. In 
human CRC specimens, a high-level expression of OPN significantly predicted 
poorer survival in CRC patients and OPN expression was positively correlated 
with MMP9 expression, and negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression. 
Furthermore, we have found that 15 genes were co-upregulated in OPN highly 
expression CRC and a list of candidate drugs that may have potential to reverse 
the secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) gene signature by connectivity mapping. In 
summary, OPN is a potential prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for 
colon cancer.
