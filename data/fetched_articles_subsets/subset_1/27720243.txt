OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quality of life (QoL) and glycemic control in youth with 
type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease vs T1D only. We hypothesized that QoL 
scores would be lower in youth with T1D and celiac disease and those nonadherent 
to the gluten-free diet (GFD).
STUDY DESIGN: This case control study included 35 youth with T1D and 35 with 
T1D  and  celiac disease matched for age, sex, diabetes duration, and hemoglobin 
A1c level. QoL was assessed in participants and parents using the Pediatric 
Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scale, Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory Diabetes Module. and the General Well-Being Scale; youth with 
T1D and celiac disease also completed the celiac disease-specific DUX 
questionnaire and parents completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
Family Impact Scale. Questionnaires were scored from 0 to 100; higher scores 
indicate better QoL or well-being. Scores were compared between T1D vs 
T1D with celiac disease, with subgroup analysis by GFD adherence vs nonadherence 
and therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily 
injections).
RESULTS: Youth with T1D  and celiac disease reported similar generic and 
diabetes-specific QoL to T1D only. GFD nonadherent vs adherent youth reported 
lower diabetes-specific QoL (mean score 58 vs 75, P = .003) and lower general 
well-being (57 vs 76, P = .02), as did their parents (50 vs 72, P = .006), and 
hemoglobin A1c was higher (9.6% vs 8.0%, P = .02). Youth with T1D  and  celiac 
disease using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple daily 
injections had similar generic and diabetes-specific QoL and A1C (8.6 vs 8.2%, 
P = .44), but were less happy having to follow a lifelong diet (59 vs 29, 
P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: Youth with T1D  and celiac disease who do not adhere to the GFD 
have lower QoL and worse glycemic control. Novel strategies are required to 
understand and improve adherence in those with both conditions.
