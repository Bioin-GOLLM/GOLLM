BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Skin rashes, mostly seen in children and adolescents, 
are considered among the most common side effects of azole antifungals. Although 
therapeutic concentrations of voriconazole (VCZ) have been documented for 
infected skin, there is no evidence specifying whether specific dermatologic 
side effects could predict high VCZ serum concentration, especially in high-risk 
leukemic children.
CASE REPORT: Herein, we report a unique skin side effect of VCZ in a 5-year-old 
boy with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) referred to Amir Medical 
Oncology Center in Shiraz, Iran. The patient experienced erythroderma and 
macular rashes shortly after VCZ consumption, leading to generalized exfoliative 
skin rashes. Concurrent to these skin manifestations, VCZ serum concentration 
reached the supratherapeutic levels despite the recommended VCZ doses. As a 
result, VCZ was withheld, and the patient was treated with caspofungin. The 
lesions were resolved gradually within 2 weeks, and the patient successfully 
completed his treatment course with caspofungin.
CONCLUSION: The unique case presented in this study emphasizes the need for a 
high index of suspicion for VCZ toxicity in any patient with atypical 
dermatologic manifestations, especially generalized exfoliative skin rashes. 
Based on this report, VCZ supratherapeutic concentration could be predicted 
early in the course of treatment. Additional therapeutic dose monitoring should 
be considered to establish a confirmatory diagnosis. It is required to further 
investigate the toxic effect of high VCZ concentration on the skin epithelium.
