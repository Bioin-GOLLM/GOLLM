AIM: Subepithelial lesions (SELs) are defined as being located under the mucosa. 
Presently, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is 
commonly performed to diagnose SELs. With the development of new puncture 
needles, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB), which allows 
for the acquisition of large tissue samples, has been proposed. However, studies 
on EUS-FNB of SELs measuring < 20 mm have not yielded satisfactory results. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess the performance and usefulness of EUS-FNB of SELs 
measuring less than < 20 mm.
METHODS: The present study included 62 patients who underwent EUS-FNA or EUS-FNB 
for SELs at our hospital between January 2015 and March 2019. EUS-FNA was 
performed using fine-needle aspiration needles, and EUS-FNB was performed using 
fine-needle biopsy needles. These needles, which come in different shapes and 
diameters, were compared in terms of their usefulness in performing procedures 
for SELs measuring ≥ 20 mm and those measuring < 20 mm.
RESULTS: For SELs measuring ≥ 20 mm, the use of needles with a large diameter, 
such as 19 or 20 G, resulted in significantly improved diagnostic rates. For 
SELs measuring < 20 mm, the use of FNB needles showed significantly improved 
diagnostic rates, regardless of the size of the puncture needles.
CONCLUSION: Even when SELs are less than 20 mm, they might have malignant 
potential, and histological diagnosis may be desirable in some cases. EUS-FNB 
has an advantage over EUS-FNA in the diagnosis of SELs measuring < 20 mm.
