Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphisms have been 
associated with an increased risk of developing a wide variety of disorders from 
diabetes to neurodegenerative diseases suggesting functions not confined to its 
vascular effects originally described. Based on the VEGF protective roles 
undisclosed in pathological conditions, we evaluate whether VEGF variability 
might be a determinant also for longevity. Four polymorphisms (-2578C/A, 
-1190G/A, -1154G/A and -634G/C) within the VEGF gene promoter region in 490 
unrelated Italian healthy subjects have been analysed. Significant changes of 
allele, genotype (-2578/AA versus -2578/CC: OR=2.08, p=0.007; -1190/AA versus 
-1190/GG: OR=2.01, p=0.011) and haplotype (AAGG: 10.4% versus 14.9%, p=0.03) 
frequency distributions were observed between young/elderly (25-84 years old) 
and long-lived (85-99 years old) subjects. These results suggest that VEGF gene 
variability can be inserted among the genetic factors influencing the lifespan.
