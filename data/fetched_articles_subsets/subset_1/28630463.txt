Antibody research has traditionally focused on heavy chains, often neglecting 
the important complementary role of light chains in antibody formation and 
secretion. In the light chain, the complementarity-determining region 3 
(VL-CDR3) is specifically implicated in disease states. By modulating VL-CDR3 
exposure on the scaffold through deletions in the framework region 3 (VL-FWR3), 
we further investigated the effects on secretion in recombinant production and 
antigen binding kinetics. Our random deletions of two residues in the VL-FWR3 of 
a Trastuzumab model showed that the single deletions could impact recombinant 
production without significant effect on Her2 binding. When both the selected 
residues were deleted, antibody secretion was additively decreased, and so was 
Her2 binding kinetics. Interestingly, we also found allosteric effects on the 
Protein L binding site at VL-FWR1 elicited by these deletions in VL- FWR3. 
Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of light chain FWR3 in 
antigen binding, recombinant production, and antibody purification using Protein 
L.
