Considering the lack of a comprehensive, multi-faceted overview of the ketogenic 
diet (KD) in relation to health issues, we compiled the evidence related to the 
use of the ketogenic diet in relation to its impact on the microbiome, the 
epigenome, diabetes, weight loss, cardiovascular health, and cancer. The KD diet 
could potentially increase genetic diversity of the microbiome and increase the 
ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes. The epigenome might be positively affected 
by the KD since it creates a signaling molecule known as Î²-hydroxybutyrate 
(BHB). KD has helped patients with diabetes reduce their HbA1c and reduce the 
need for insulin. There is evidence to suggest that a KD can help with weight 
loss, visceral adiposity, and appetite control. The evidence also suggests that 
eating a high-fat diet improves lipid profiles by lowering low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL), increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lowering 
triglycerides (TG). Due to the Warburg effect, the KD is used as an adjuvant 
treatment to starve cancer cells, making them more vulnerable to chemotherapy 
and radiation. The potential positive impacts of a KD on each of these areas 
warrant further analysis, improved studies, and well-designed randomized 
controlled trials to further illuminate the therapeutic possibilities provided 
by this dietary intervention.
