Somites (SMs) comprise a transient stem cell population that gives rise to 
multiple cell types, including dermatome (D), myotome (MYO), sclerotome (SCL) 
and syndetome (SYN) cells. Although several groups have reported induction 
protocols for MYO and SCL from pluripotent stem cells, no studies have 
demonstrated the induction of SYN and D from SMs. Here, we report systematic 
induction of these cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) under 
chemically defined conditions. We also successfully induced cells with 
differentiation capacities similar to those of multipotent mesenchymal stromal 
cells (MSC-like cells) from SMs. To evaluate the usefulness of these protocols, 
we conducted disease modeling of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), an 
inherited disease that is characterized by heterotopic endochondral ossification 
in soft tissues after birth. Importantly, FOP-iPSC-derived MSC-like cells showed 
enhanced chondrogenesis, whereas FOP-iPSC-derived SCL did not, possibly 
recapitulating normal embryonic skeletogenesis in FOP and cell-type specificity 
of FOP phenotypes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of multipotent SMs 
for disease modeling and future cell-based therapies.
