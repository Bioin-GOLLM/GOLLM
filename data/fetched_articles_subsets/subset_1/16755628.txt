Lipoxygenases are lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that have been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and lipoxygenase inhibitors may be 
developed as anti-inflammatory drugs. Structure comparison with known 
lipoxygenase inhibitors has suggested that 
(2Z)-2-(3-benzylidene)-3-oxo-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-7-carboxylic acid 
methyl ester might inhibit the lipoxygenase pathway but we found that it 
exhibited only a low inhibitory potency for the pure 12/15-lipoxygenase (IC(50) 
= 0.7 mM). However, photoactivation, which induces a Z-to-E isomerization of the 
double bond, strongly augmented the inhibitory potency and an IC(50) value of 
0.021 mM was determined for the pure E isomer. Similar isomer-specific 
differences were observed with the recombinant enzyme and its 12-lipoxygenating 
Ile418Ala mutant, as well as in intracellular lipoxygenase activity. Structure 
modeling of the enzyme/inhibitor complex suggested the molecular reasons for 
this isomer specificity. Since light-induced isomerization may proceed in the 
skin, such photoreactive compounds might be developed as potential drugs for 
inflammatory skin diseases.
