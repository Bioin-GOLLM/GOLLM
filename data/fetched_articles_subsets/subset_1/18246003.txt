STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical study into the association between genetic 
polymorphism in COL9A2 and mechanical properties of human nucleus pulposus.
OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there is an association between genetic 
polymorphism in a structural gene, and alterations in the mechanical properties 
of the intervertebral discs that may predispose to disc degeneration.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Genetic studies have demonstrated that a 
polymorphism (Trp2 allele) in COL9A2 coding for alpha2 chain of collagen IX 
predisposes the individual to disc degeneration. The mechanism of this 
predisposition is not known.
METHODS: Blood and whole disc samples were retrieved from adolescents and young 
adults during scoliosis surgery, degenerated discs were retrieved from patients 
with back pain during anterior spinal fusion. Anulus fibrosus and nucleus 
pulposus from a set of the scoliosis discs were used to perform 
immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the presence of collagen IX in the scoliosis 
discs. For the remaining samples, DNA was extracted from blood to determine the 
Trp2 status by sequencing. Nondegenerated (Trp2-), nondegenerated (Trp2+), and 
degenerated (Trp2-) nucleus pulposus samples were tested in confined 
compression. Swelling pressure and compressive modulus were measured and 
compared between groups.
RESULTS: Positive staining of collagen IX was detected in both anulus fibrosus 
and nucleus pulposus sections confirming its presence in the scoliosis discs. 
The mean swelling pressure and compressive modulus values of 6 nondegenerated 
(Trp2+) samples (swelling pressure = 0.0019 MPa, compressive modulus = 0.97 MPa) 
were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of the 6 nondegenerated (Trp2-) 
samples (swelling pressure = 0.015 MPa; compressive modulus = 1.89 MPa).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate an association between the 
Trp2 allele and disc mechanics, thus relating genetic variations and 
debilitating mechanical alterations that may ultimately result in intervertebral 
disc degeneration.
