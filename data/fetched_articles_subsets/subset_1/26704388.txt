Galectin 3 (LGALS3) expression is prognostic for poor survival in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) patients. GCS-100 is a novel galectin inhibitor that may prove 
useful for AML therapy. In this study, we found that GCS-100 induced apoptosis 
in AML cells. The agent reduced MCL-1 expression suggesting that GCS-100 could 
be more effective when combined with a BH3 mimetic. Indeed, potent synergistic 
cytotoxicity was achieved when GCS-100 was combined with ABT-737 or ABT-199. 
Furthermore, the GCS-100/ABT-199 combination was effective against primary AML 
blast cells from patients with FLT3 ITD mutations, which is another prognostic 
factor for poor outcome in AML. This activity may involve wild-type p53 as shRNA 
knockdown of LGALS3 or galectin 1 (LGALS1) sensitized wild-type p53 OCI-AML3 
cells to GCS-100/ABT-737-induced apoptosis to a much greater extent than p53 
null THP-1 cells. Suppression of LGALS3 by shRNA inhibited MCL-1 expression in 
OCI-AML3 cells, but not THP-1 cells, suggesting the induced sensitivity to 
ABT-737 may involve a MCL-1 mediated mechanism. OCI-AML3 cells with LGALS1 shRNA 
were also sensitized to ABT-737. However, these cells exhibited increased MCL-1 
expression, so MCL-1 reduction is apparently not required in this process. A 
role for p53 appears important as GCS-100 induces p53 expression and shRNA 
knockdown of p53 protected OCI-AML3 cells from the cytotoxic effects of the 
GCS-100/ABT-737 treatment combination. Our results suggest that galectins 
regulate a survival axis in AML cells, which may be targeted via combined 
inhibition with drugs such as GCS-100 and ABT-199.
