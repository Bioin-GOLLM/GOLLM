AIM: The study aimed to systematically evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
ultrasonography-guided percutaneous thermal ablation in the treatment of 
cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) of recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC).
METHODS: PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), Embase, and Cochrane were examined. The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined and the relevant data were 
extracted from the library and other databases for LNM thermal ablation of 
recurrent PTC. The data were analyzed using Stata15.1, Revman5.3 software, and 
the standard errors of 95% confidence intervals were estimated using fixed or 
random effects models. Volume reduction rate (VRR), Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) 
level before and after thermal ablation, the total complications and major 
complications incidence were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 18 literature articles were included, namely, 10 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 4 laser ablation (LA), and 4 microwave ablation 
(MWA). A total of 321 patients had 498 LNM. LNM volume changes before and at the 
last follow-up of thermal ablation (SMD = 1.04, I2 = 8%, 95% CI 0.86-1.21, P 
<0.0001). The postoperative lymph node VRR was 88.4% (95% CI 77.8-97.3%, I2 = 
34%, P = 0.14). Tg measurements before and after thermal ablation (SMD = 1.15, 
95% CI 0.69-1.60, I2 = 84%, P <0.0001). The incidence of total complications was 
5.0% (95% CI 3.0-7.0%, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.915), and the incidence of major 
complications was 4.0% (95% CI 2.0-6.0%, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.888). A total of 131 
LNM were located in the central region, and the major complication rate was 
12.0% (95% CI 6.0-18.0%, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.653).
CONCLUSION: Ultrasonography-guided thermal ablation is safe and effective in the 
treatment of LNM of recurrent PTC. The ablation strategy of central LNM needs to 
be further explored and improved. It can be used as an alternative to surgery 
for patients with high surgical risk or who refuse resurgery.
