Rice bran is a "treasure house of natural nutrition". Even so, utilization of 
rice bran is often ignored, and this has resulted in the wastage of nutrients. 
Polysaccharides are one of the active substances in rice bran that have gained 
widespread attention for their antioxidant, antitumor, immune-enhancing, 
antibacterial, and hypoglycemic properties. This review summarizes the 
extraction methods, structural characterization, bioactivity, and application of 
rice bran polysaccharides that have been developed and studied in recent years, 
laying a foundation for its development into foods and medicines. In addition, 
we also discuss the prospects for future research on rice bran polysaccharides.
