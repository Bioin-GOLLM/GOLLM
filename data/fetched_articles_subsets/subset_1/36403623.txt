The Moloney sarcoma oncogene (MOS) encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase and 
MOS is expressed at high levels in oocytes undergoing meiotic maturation. The 
MOS/MAPK pathway is normally required for the maintenance of microtubules and 
chromatin in a metaphasic state during the meiotic divisions. To determine the 
pathogenic genes in a female infertile patient due to large polar body oocytes, 
whole-exome sequencing was performed on the patient and available family 
members. We identified a novel homozygous missense mutation c.591T > G in MOS. 
Bioinformatics analysis showed that the mutation is harmful. These findings 
suggest that MOS mutation results in oocytes with a large polar body and poor 
embryonic development in patients. The MOS variant may regulate oocyte 
asymmetric division by MAPK/WAVE2/Arp2/3/actin signaling pathway. This will help 
to understand the comprehensive role of MOS in early human reproductive process 
and provide genetic markers for future genetic counseling for more 
individualized treatments.
