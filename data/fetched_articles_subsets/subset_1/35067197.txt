The majority of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contain transposable elements 
(TEs). PAHAL, a nuclear-retained lncRNA that is inserted by a Gypsy 
retrotransposon, has been shown to be a vital regulator of phenylalanine 
hydroxylase (PAH) gene expression that controls dopamine biosynthesis and 
behavioural aggregation in the migratory locust. However, the role of the Gypsy 
retrotransposon in the transcriptional regulation of PAHAL remains unknown. 
Here, we identified a Gypsy retrotransposon (named Gypsy element) as an inverted 
long terminal repeat located in the 3' end of PAHAL, representing a feature 
shared by many other lncRNAs in the locust genome. The embedded Gypsy element 
contains a RNA nuclear localization signal motif, which promotes the stable 
accumulation of PAHAL in the nucleus. The Gypsy element also provides 
high-affinity SRSF2 binding sites for PAHAL that induce the recruitment of 
SRSF2, resulting in the PAHAL-mediated transcriptional activation of PAH. Thus, 
our data demonstrate that TEs provide discrete functional domains for lncRNA 
organization and highlight the contribution of TEs to the regulatory 
significance of lncRNAs.
