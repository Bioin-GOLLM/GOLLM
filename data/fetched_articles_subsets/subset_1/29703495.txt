While licensed vaccines elicit protective antibody responses against a variety 
of viral infections, an effective vaccine for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has 
remained elusive. The extraordinary genetic diversity of HCV and the ability of 
the virus to evade the immune response have hindered vaccine development 
efforts. However, recent studies have greatly expanded the number of well 
characterized broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs) against 
HCV. These bNAbs target relatively conserved HCV epitopes, prevent HCV infection 
in animal models, and are associated with spontaneous clearance of human HCV 
infection. In this review, recent high-resolution bNAb epitope mapping and 
structural analysis of bNAb-epitope complexes that may serve as a guide for 
vaccine development are discussed along with major obstacles.
