An angiogenic factor, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor/thymidine 
phosphorylase (PD-ECGF/TP), stimulates the chemotaxis of endothelial cells and 
confers resistance to apoptosis induced by hypoxia. 2-Deoxy-D-ribose, a 
degradation product of thymidine generated by TP enzymatic activity, partially 
prevented hypoxia-induced apoptosis. TP was expressed at higher levels in tumor 
tissuses compared to the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in a variety of human 
carcinomas. High expression of TP is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. 
To investigate the effect of TP on cisplatin-induced apoptosis, human leukemia 
Jurkat cells were transfected wild-type or mutant (L148R) TP cDNA. TP inhibits a 
number of steps in the cisplatin-induced apoptotic pathway, activation of 
caspase 3, 9 and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. These findings suggest a 
mechanism by which TP confers the resistance to apoptosis by cisplatin. 
Moreover, mutant TP that has no enzymatic activity also suppressed 
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that TP has cytoprotective 
functions against cytotoxic agents which are independent of its enzymatic 
activity.
