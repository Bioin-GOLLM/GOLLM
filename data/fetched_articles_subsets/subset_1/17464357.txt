Steroid hormones are a diverse class of structurally related molecules, derived 
from cholesterol, that include androgens, estrogens, progesterone and 
corticosteroids. They represent an important group of physiologically active 
signalling molecules that bind intracellular receptor proteins and regulate 
genes involved in developmental, reproductive and metabolic processes. The 
receptor proteins share structurally and functionally related ligand binding and 
DNA-binding domains, but possess distinct N-terminal domains (NTD) of unique 
length and amino acids sequence. The NTD contains sequences important for gene 
regulation, exhibit structure plasticity and are likely to contribute to the 
specificity of the steroid hormone/receptor response.
