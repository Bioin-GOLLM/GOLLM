G protein-coupled receptor 39 (GPR39) is a zinc-sensing receptor (ZnR) that can 
sense changes in extracellular Zn2+, mediate Zn2+ signal transmission, and 
participate in the regulation of numerous physiological activities in living 
organisms. For example, GPR39 activates the extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) and 
phosphatidylinositol3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathways upon 
Zn2+ stimulation, enhances the proliferation and differentiation of colonic 
cells, and regulates ion transport, as well as exerting other functions. In 
recent years, with the increased attention to animal gut health issues and the 
intensive research on GPR39, GPR39 has become a potential target for regulating 
animal intestinal health. On the one hand, GPR39 is involved in regulating ion 
transport in the animal intestine, mediating the Cl- efflux by activating the 
K+/Cl- synergistic protein transporter, and relieving diarrhea symptoms. On the 
other hand, GPR39 can maintain the homeostasis of the animal intestine, 
promoting pH restoration in colonic cells, regulating gastric acid secretion, 
and facilitating nutrient absorption. In addition, GPR39 can affect the 
expression of tight junction proteins in intestinal epithelial cells, improving 
the barrier function of the animal intestinal mucosa, and maintaining the 
integrity of the intestine. This review summarizes the structure and signaling 
transduction processes involving GPR39 and the effect of GPR39 on the regulation 
of intestinal health in animals, with the aim of further highlighting the role 
of GPR39 in regulating animal intestinal health and providing new directions and 
ideas for studying the prevention and treatment of animal intestinal diseases.
