Background: Nutrient supplements are widely used for type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet 
evidence-based guidance for clinicians is lacking. Methods: We searched the four 
electronic databases from November 2015−December 2021. The most recent, most 
comprehensive, high-ranked systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and/or umbrella 
reviews of randomised controlled trials in adults with T2D were included. Data 
were extracted on study characteristics, aggregate outcome measures per group 
(glycaemic control, measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion), adverse 
events, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
(GRADE) assessments. Quality was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess 
Systematic Reviews Version 2.0 (AMSTAR 2). Results: Twelve meta-analyses and one 
umbrella review were included. There was very low certainty evidence that 
chromium, Vitamin C, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Ω-3 PUFAs) were 
superior to placebo for the primary outcome of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Mean 
Difference/MD −0.54, −0.54 and ES −0.27, respectively). Probiotics were superior 
to placebo for HbA1c (Weighted Mean Difference/WMD −0.43%). There was very low 
certainty evidence that Vitamin D was superior to placebo for lowering HbA1c in 
trials of <6 months (MD −0.17%). Magnesium, zinc, Vitamin C, probiotics, and 
polyphenols were superior to placebo for FBG. Vitamin D was superior to placebo 
for insulin resistance. Data on safety was limited. Conclusions: Future research 
should identify who may benefit from nutrient supplementation, safety, and 
optimal regimens and formulations.
