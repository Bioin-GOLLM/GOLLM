Picornavirus infections lead to symptoms that can have serious health and 
economic implications. The viruses in this family (Picornaviridae) have a small 
genomic RNA and must rely on host proteins for efficient viral gene expression 
and RNA replication. To ensure their effectiveness as pathogens, picornaviruses 
have evolved to utilize and/or alter host proteins for the benefit of the virus 
life cycle. This review discusses the host proteins that are subverted during 
infection to aid in virus replication. It will also describe proteins and 
functions that are altered during infection for the benefit of the virus.
