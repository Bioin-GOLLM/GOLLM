Data on the frequency of alpha-synuclein mutations in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
are limited. Screening the entire coding region in 1,921 PD patients with 
denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and subsequent sequencing we 
only detected silent mutations (g.2654A>G, g.10151G>A, and g.15986A>T) and the 
c.209G>A substitution corresponding to the p.A53T mutation. These results 
demonstrate that mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene are rare and suggest that 
other factors contribute to alpha-synuclein aggregation in the majority of PD 
patients.
