BACKGROUND/AIM: Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) plays a critical role in the 
regulation of the extracellular matrix; however, its genotypes have seldom been 
examined in gastric cancer (GC). This study aimed to investigate the 
contribution of MMP-2 promoter -1306 (rs243865) and -735 (rs2285053) genotypes 
to GC risk in a cohort of Taiwanese individuals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 121 GC cases and 363 age- and 
sex-matched controls. The genotypes of MMP-2 were determined by typical 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: The genotypic and allelic frequency analysis showed that MMP-2 rs243865 
variant genotypes decreased the risk of GC. Stratification analysis showed that 
MMP-2 rs243865 genotypes associate with smoking, alcohol drinking, and 
Helicobacter pylori infection status to confer personal susceptibility to GC. 
There is no such association for MMP-2 rs2285053 genotype with GC risk.
CONCLUSION: The MMP-2 rs243865 genotypes may serve as a novel predictive marker 
for GC personal susceptibility among Taiwanese.
