IMPORTANCE: High-prevalence foci of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) exist in Japanese on the Kii Peninsula of 
Japan and in the Chamorros of Guam. Clinical and neuropathologic similarities 
suggest that the disease in these 2 populations may be related. Recent findings 
showed that some of the Kii Peninsula ALS cases had pathogenic C9orf72 repeat 
expansions, a genotype that causes ALS in Western populations.
OBJECTIVES: To perform genotyping among Guam residents to determine if the 
C9orf72 expanded repeat allele contributes to ALS-PDC in this population and to 
evaluate LRRK2 for mutations in the same population.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Case-control series from neurodegenerative disease research 
programs on Guam that screened residents for ALS, PDC, and dementia.
PARTICIPANTS: Study participants included 24 with ALS and 22 with PDC and 43 
older control subjects with normal cognition ascertained between 1956 and 2006. 
All but one participant were Chamorro, the indigenous people of Guam. A single 
individual of white race/ethnicity with ALS was ascertained on Guam during the 
study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants were screened for C9orf72 
hexanucleotide repeat length. Participants with repeat numbers in great excess 
of 30 were considered to have pathogenic repeat expansions. LRRK2 was screened 
for point mutations by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: We found a single individual with an expanded pathogenic hexanucleotide 
repeat. This individual of white race/ethnicity with ALS was living on Guam at 
the time of ascertainment but had been born in the United States. All Chamorro 
participants with ALS and PDC and control subjects had normal repeats, ranging 
from 2 to 17 copies. No pathogenic LRRK2 mutations were found.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unlike participants with ALS from the Kii Peninsula, 
C9orf72 expansions do not cause ALS-PDC in Chamorros. Likewise, LRRK2 mutations 
do not cause Guam ALS-PDC.
