BACKGROUND: Childhood cardiomyopathies are progressive and often lethal 
disorders, forming the most common cause of heart failure in children. Despite 
severe outcomes, their genetic background is still poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the genetics of severe 
childhood cardiomyopathies in a countrywide cohort.
METHODS: The authors collected a countrywide cohort, KidCMP, of 66 severe 
childhood cardiomyopathies from the sole center in Finland performing cardiac 
transplantation. For genetic diagnosis, next-generation sequencing and 
subsequent validation using genetic, cell biology, and computational approaches 
were used.
RESULTS: The KidCMP cohort presents remarkable early-onset and severe disorders: 
the median age of diagnosis was 0.33 years, and 17 patients underwent cardiac 
transplantation. The authors identified the pathogenic variants in 39% of 
patients: 46% de novo, 34% recessive, and 20% dominantly-inherited. The authors 
report NRAP underlying childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as novel 
phenotypes for known heart disease genes. Some genetic diagnoses have immediate 
implications for treatment: CALM1 with life-threatening arrhythmias, and TAZ 
with good cardiac prognosis. The disease genes converge on metabolic causes 
(PRKAG2, MRPL44, AARS2, HADHB, DNAJC19, PPA2, TAZ, BAG3), MAPK pathways (HRAS, 
PTPN11, RAF1, TAB2), development (NEK8 and TBX20), calcium signaling (JPH2, 
CALM1, CACNA1C), and the sarcomeric contraction cycle (TNNC1, TNNI3, ACTC1, 
MYH7, NRAP).
CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cardiomyopathies are typically caused by rare, 
family-specific mutations, most commonly de novo, indicating that 
next-generation sequencing of trios is the approach of choice in their 
diagnosis. Genetic diagnoses may suggest intervention strategies and predict 
prognosis, offering valuable tools for prioritization of patients for 
transplantation versus conservative treatment.
