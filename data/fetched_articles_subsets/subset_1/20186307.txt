The inflammatory bowel diseases, consisting of Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis and indeterminate colitis, are distinguished by idiopathic and chronic 
inflammation of the digestive tract. The distinction between inflammatory bowel 
diseases and functional bowel disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, can 
be complex because they often present with similar symptoms. Rapid and 
inexpensive noninvasive tests that are sensitive, specific and simple are needed 
to prevent patient discomfort, delay in diagnosis, and unnecessary costs. None 
of the current commercially available serological biomarker tests can be used as 
a stand-alone diagnostic in clinics. Instead, these are used as an adjunct to 
endoscopy in diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. Along these lines,, fecal 
lactoferrin and calprotectin tests seem to be one step further from other tests 
with larger number of studies, higher sensitivity and specificity and wider 
availability.
