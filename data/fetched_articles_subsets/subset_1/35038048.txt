BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive lipid 
storage disorder, affecting the nervous system and the internal organs. It is 
characterized by the presence of foam cells in bone marrow, liver, and spleen 
biopsies. Although many mutations in NPC1 have been identified to be related to 
disease onset, the relationship between genotype and phenotype remains unclear. 
To elucidate the genetic heterogeneity of NPC, we described the clinical 
manifestations and possible genetic pathogenesis of two patients from unrelated 
families with NPC.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of the two patients and 
their families and from healthy individuals. Whole-exome sequencing followed by 
Sanger sequencing was performed to verify the mutations identified in their 
families.
RESULTS: We identified four mutations in NPC1 in the two patients from different 
families: c.1290delC (p.F431Lfs*18)/c.2807G > A(p.G936D) in family A and 
c.3604_3605insA (p.I1202Nfs*56)/c.881 + 3A > G in family B from their parents. 
Bioinformatics analysis predicted these mutations to be deleterious, suggesting 
that mutations in exons are highly conservative. The patient in family A 
presented with a developmental delay that was different from the typical 
symptoms of developmental regression in family B.
CONCLUSION: Our study identified three novel mutations and one known mutation in 
NPC1 and evaluated their pathogenicity, enriching the NPC1 mutation and 
phenotype spectrum and providing a new basis for the genetic and prenatal 
diagnosis of this disease.
