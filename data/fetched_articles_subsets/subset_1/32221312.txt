Extracellular release of HMGB1 contributes to acetaminophen-induced liver 
injury. HMGB1 acts as a danger-associated molecular patterns during this toxic 
process but the mechanisms of action and targeted cells are incompletely 
defined. Here we studied, in vitro, the role of HMGB1 in amplifying the 
acetaminophen-induced hepatocyte necrosis process. Using cultured HepaRG cells, 
primary human hepatocytes and selective chemical inhibitors we evaluated 
acetaminophen-induced toxicity. We confirmed that addition of acetaminophen 
induced HepaRG cell death and HMGB1 release. We showed that inhibition of HMGB1 
decreased acetaminophen-induced HepaRG cell death, suggesting a feedforward 
effect. We provide the first evidence that exposure of HepaRG cells to 
recombinant human HMGB1 (rhHMGB1) also resulted in cell death. Moreover, we 
found that both acetaminophen and rhHMGB1 induced programmed HepaRG cell 
necrosis through a RIPK3-dependent mechanism. By using TLR4 blocking antibody, 
we demonstrated the reduction of the HepaRG cell death induced by acetaminophen 
and rhHMGB1. Furthermore, inhibition of TRIF, known to induce a RIPK3-dependent 
cell death, reduced rhHMGB1-induced HepaRG cell death. Our data support that 
released HMGB1 from acetaminophen-stressed hepatocytes induced necrosis of 
neighboring hepatocytes by TLR4-TRIF-RIPK3- pathway. This in vitro study gives 
new insights in the role of HMGB1 in the amplification of acetaminophen-induced 
toxicity.
