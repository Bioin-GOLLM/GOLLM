Azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus is increasing worldwide and can affect 
prognosis. It is mostly mediated by cytochrome P51 (CYP51) mutations. In lung 
transplant recipients (LTR), little is known regarding the prevalence and 
clinical impact of CYP51 mutations. One hundred thirty-one consecutive A. 
fumigatus isolates from 103 patients were subjected to CYP51A genotyping through 
PCR and sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using the 
Sensititre YeastOne YO-9© broth microdilution technique. Correlations between 
genotype, phenotype, clinical manifestations of Aspergillus infection, and 
clinical outcomes were made. Thirty-four (26%) isolates harbored mutations of 
CYP51A; N248K (n = 14) and A9T (n = 12) were the most frequent. Three isolates 
displayed multiple point mutations. No significant influences of mutational 
status were identified regarding azole MICs, the clinical presentation of 
Aspergillus disease, 1-year all-cause mortality, and clinical outcomes of 
invasive forms. In the specific context of lung transplant recipients, 
non-hotspot CYP51A-mutated isolates are regularly encountered; this does not 
result in major clinical consequences or therapeutic challenges.
LAY SUMMARY: In 131 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates originating from 
103 lung transplant recipients, the CYP51A polymorphism rate was 26%, mostly 
represented by N248K and A9T mutations. These mutations, however, did not 
significantly impact azoles minimal inhibitory concentrations or clinical 
outcomes.
