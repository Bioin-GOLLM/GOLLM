BACKGROUND: Ryanodine receptor (RyR2) mutations have largely been associated 
with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT). The role of 
RyR2 mutations in the pathogenesis of arrhythmias and syncope at rest is 
unknown. We sought to characterize the clinical and functional characteristics 
associated with a novel RyR2 mutation found in a mother and daughter with PMVT 
at rest.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A 31-year-old female with syncope at rest and recurrent 
short-coupled premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) initiating PMVT was 
found to be heterozygous for a novel RyR2-H29D mutation. Her mother, who also 
had syncope at rest and short-coupled PMVT, was found to harbor the same 
mutation. Human RyR2-H29D mutant channels were generated using site-directed 
mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells together with the 
stabilizing protein calstabin2 (FKPB12.6). Single channel measurements of 
RyR2-H29D mutant channels and wild type (WT) RyR2 channels were compared at 
varying concentrations of cytosolic Ca(2+). Binding affinities of the RyR2-H29D 
channels and RyR2-WT channels to calstabin2 were compared. Functional 
characterization of the RyR2-H29D mutant channel revealed significantly higher 
open probability and opening frequency at diastolic levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) 
under non-stress conditions without protein kinase A treatment. This was 
associated with a modest depletion of calstabin2 binding under resting 
conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The RyR2-H29D mutation is associated with a clinical phenotype of 
short-coupled PMVT at rest. In contrast to catecholaminergic PMVT-associated 
RyR2 mutations, RyR2-H29D causes a leaky channel at diastolic levels of Ca(2+) 
under non-stress conditions. Leaky RyR2 may be an under-recognized mechanism for 
idiopathic PMVT at rest.
