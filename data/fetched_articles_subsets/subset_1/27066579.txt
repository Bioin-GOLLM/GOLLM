Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) is a rare condition, 
predominantly affecting the peripheral sensory nervous system, although variable 
motor and dysautonomic symptoms can be present. At least 7 clinical types of 
HSAN have been described, and different genetic mutations have been identified 
for each of these. HSAN IIA (OMIM #201300) is characterized by loss of pain and 
loss of temperature and touch sensation, with onset usually before the first 
decade. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.(1) The causative gene, 
WNK1/HSN2, is located on locus 12p13.33 and is an isoform of the WNK1 (lysine 
deficient protein kinase 1) gene, which contains the HSN2 exon.(2,3) We describe 
2 new heterozygous mutations in the WNK1/HSN2 gene in a Belgian patient with 
early-onset sensory polyneuropathy.
