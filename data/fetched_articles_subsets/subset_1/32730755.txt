In response to respiratory insults, airway submucosal glands secrete copious 
mucus strands to increase mucociliary clearance and protect the lung. However, 
in cystic fibrosis, stimulating submucosal glands has the opposite effect, 
disrupting mucociliary transport. In cystic fibrosis (CF) pigs, loss of cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) anion channels produced 
submucosal gland mucus that was abnormally acidic with an increased protein 
concentration. To test whether these variables alter mucus, we produced a 
microfluidic model of submucosal glands using mucus vesicles from banana slugs. 
Acidic pH and increased protein concentration decreased mucus gel volume and 
increased mucus strand elasticity and tensile strength. However, once mucus 
strands were formed, changing pH or protein concentration largely failed to 
alter the biophysical properties. Likewise, raising pH or apical perfusion did 
not improve clearance of mucus strands from CF airways. These findings reveal 
mechanisms responsible for impaired mucociliary transport in CF and have 
important implications for potential treatments.
