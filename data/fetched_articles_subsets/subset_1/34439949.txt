Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative 
disease. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that alpha-synuclein (α-Syn), an 
apparently predominant neuronal protein, is a major contributor to PD pathology. 
As α-Syn is also highly abundant in blood, particularly in red blood cells 
(RBCs) and platelets, this in turn raises the question on the function of 
presumably dysfunctional α-Syn in "peripheral" cells and its putative effect on 
the other enclosed constituents. Herein, we detected the internal variance in 
erythrocytes of PD patients by Raman spectroscopy, but no measurable amount of 
erythrocytic behavioural change (eryptosis) or any haemoglobin variation was 
noticed. An elevated level of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes (PAP) was observed 
in the plasma of PD patients, indicating activation of the fibrinolytic system, 
but platelet activation after thrombin stimulation was not altered. Sex-specific 
patterns were noticed for blood coagulation factor XIII and factor XII activity 
in PD patients. Additionally, the alterations in homocysteine levels which have 
often been observed in PD patients were found to be independent from L-DOPA 
usage and PAP levels. Furthermore, a selective gene expression analysis 
identified subsets of genes related to different blood-associated compartments 
(RBCs, platelets, coagulation-fibrinolysis) also involved in PD-related 
pathways.
