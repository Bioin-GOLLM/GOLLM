Monitoring population protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants is 
critical for risk assessment. We hypothesize that Hong Kong's explosive Omicron 
BA.2 outbreak in early 2022 could be explained by low herd immunity. Our 
seroprevalence study using sera collected from January to December 2021 shows a 
very low prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against ancestral virus 
among older adults. The age group-specific prevalence of NAb generally 
correlates with the vaccination uptake rate, but older adults have a much lower 
NAb seropositive rate than vaccination uptake rate. For all age groups, the 
seroprevalence of NAb against Omicron variant is much lower than that against 
the ancestral virus. Our study suggests that this BA.2 outbreak and the 
exceptionally high case-fatality rate in the ≥80 year-old age group (9.2%) could 
be attributed to the lack of protective immunity in the population, especially 
among the vulnerable older adults, and that ongoing sero-surveillance is 
essential.
