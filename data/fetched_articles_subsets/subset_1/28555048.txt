AIMS: Determining the origin of metastases is an important task of pathologists 
to allow for the initiation of a tumor-specific therapy. Recently, homeobox 
protein Hox-B13 (HOXB13) has been suggested as a new marker for the detection of 
prostatic origin. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic 
sensitivity of HOXB13 in comparison to commonly used immunohistochemical markers 
for prostate cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histologically confirmed prostate cancer lymph node 
metastases from 64 cases were used to test the diagnostic value of 
immunohistochemical markers: prostate specific antigen (PSA), Prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PSAP), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), homeobox gene 
NKX3.1, prostein, androgen receptor (AR), HOXB13, and ETS-related gene (ERG). 
All markers were evaluated semi-quantitatively using Remmele's immune reactive 
score.
RESULTS: The detection rate of prostate origin of metastasis for single markers 
was 100% for NKX3.1, 98.1% for AR, 84.3% for PSMA, 80.8% for PSA, 66% for PSAP, 
60.4% for HOXB13, 59.6% for prostein, and 50.0% for ERG.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that HOXB13 on its own lacks sensitivity for the 
detection of prostatic origin. Therefore, this marker should be only used in 
conjunction with other markers, preferably the highly specific PSA. The 
combination of PSA with NKX3.1 shows a higher sensitivity and thus appears 
preferable in this setting.
