BACKGROUND: The management of children with pediatric mastocytosis poses a 
challenge. This is because there is limited information as to the application of 
clinical and laboratory findings and bone marrow histopathology as they relate 
to medical intervention and communication.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine clinical aspects of pediatric mastocytosis in 
relationship to serum tryptase levels and bone marrow pathology to provide 
practical guidance for management.
METHODS: Between 1986 and 2012, 105 children were evaluated at the National 
Institutes of Health. Organomegaly was confirmed by means of ultrasound. 
Baseline tryptase levels and at least 1 subsequent tryptase measurement was 
available in 84 and 37 of these children, respectively. Fifty-three children 
underwent a bone marrow examination. These data were used to examine 
relationships between clinical findings, tryptase levels, and marrow 
histopathology.
RESULTS: In patients with high tryptase levels and severe mediator symptoms, all 
with organomegaly had systemic disease, and none without organomegaly had 
systemic disease. Serum tryptase levels differed significantly between patients 
with urticaria pigmentosa and those with diffuse cutaneous (P < .0001) and 
systemic mastocytosis (P < .0001) and in all 3 categories versus control 
subjects (P < .0001). Tryptase levels and symptoms decreased over time in most 
patients, and tryptase levels correlated with bone marrow mast cell burden in 
patients with systemic mastocytosis (P < .0001). There was a significant 
relationship between clinical resolution and the percentage decrease in tryptase 
levels (P = .0014).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children experienced major or complete disease 
resolution (57%), whereas the remainder exhibited partial improvement. 
Organomegaly was a strong indicator of systemic disease. Serum tryptase levels 
furthered classification and reflected clinicopathologic findings, while 
sequential tryptase measurements were useful in supplementing clinical judgment 
as to disease course.
