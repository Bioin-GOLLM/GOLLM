We have reported previously that a missense mutation in the mitochondrial 
fission gene Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) underlies the Python mouse model 
of monogenic dilated cardiomyopathy. The aim of this study was to investigate 
the consequences of the C452F mutation on Drp1 protein function and to define 
the cellular sequelae leading to heart failure in the Python monogenic dilated 
cardiomyopathy model. We found that the C452F mutation increased Drp1 GTPase 
activity. The mutation also conferred resistance to oligomer disassembly by 
guanine nucleotides and high ionic strength solutions. In a mouse embryonic 
fibroblast model, Drp1 C452F cells exhibited abnormal mitochondrial morphology 
and defective mitophagy. Mitochondria in C452F mouse embryonic fibroblasts were 
depolarized and had reduced calcium uptake with impaired ATP production by 
oxidative phosphorylation. In the Python heart, we found a corresponding 
progressive decline in oxidative phosphorylation with age and activation of 
sterile inflammation. As a corollary, enhancing autophagy by exposure to a 
prolonged low-protein diet improved cardiac function in Python mice. In 
conclusion, failure of Drp1 disassembly impairs mitophagy, leading to a 
downstream cascade of mitochondrial depolarization, aberrant calcium handling, 
impaired ATP synthesis, and activation of sterile myocardial inflammation, 
resulting in heart failure.
