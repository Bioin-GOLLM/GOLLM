OBJECTIVE: Rotavirus A (RVA) remains the main causative agent of gastroenteritis 
in young children and the young of many mammalian and avian species. In this 
study we describe a RVA strain detected from a 6-month-old child from Central 
African Republic (CAR).
RESULTS: We report the 11 open reading frame sequences of a 
G29-P[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 rotavirus strain, 
RVA/Human-wt/CAR/CAR91/2014/G29P[6]. Nine genes (VP1-VP3, VP6, NSP1-NSP5) shared 
90-100% sequence similarities with genogroup 2 rotaviruses. Phylogenetically, 
backbone genes, except for VP3 and NSP4 genes, were linked with cognate gene 
sequences of human DS-1-like genogroup 2, hence their genetic origin. The VP3 
and NSP4 genes, clustered genetically with both human and animal strains, an 
indication genetic reassortment human and animal RVA strains has taken place. 
The VP7 gene shared nucleotide (93-94%) and amino acid (95.5-96.7%) identities 
with Kenyan and Belgian human G29 strains, as well as to buffalo G29 strain from 
South Africa, while the VP4 gene most closely resembled P[6]-lineage I strains 
from Africa and Bangladesh (97%).
