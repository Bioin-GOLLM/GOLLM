Thyroid carcinomas, despite the usually indolent behaviour and relatively good 
overall prognosis, show a high tendency to gain invasive phenotype and 
metastasise in some cases. However, due to a relatively slow progression, the 
exact mechanisms governing the metastatic process of thyroid carcinomas, 
including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are poorly described. 
One of the best-known regulators of cancer invasiveness is Snail-1-a zinc-finger 
transcription factor that plays a key role as an EMT inducer. More and more 
attention is being paid to the role of Snail with regard to thyroid cancer 
development. Apart from the obvious implications in the EMT process, Snail-1 
plays an important role in the regulation of chemoresistance of the thyroid 
cells and cancer stem cell (CSC) formation, and it also interacts with miRNA 
specific to the thyroid gland. The aim of this review was to summarise the 
knowledge on Snail-1, especially in the context of thyroid oncogenesis.
