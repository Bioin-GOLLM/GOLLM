Refsum disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis 
pigmentosa, peripheral polyneuropathy, cerebellar ataxia and increased 
cerebrospinal fluid protein. Biochemically, the disorder is defined by two 
related properties: pronounced accumulation of phytanic acid and selective loss 
of the peroxisomal dioxygenase required for alpha-hydroxylation of 
phytanoyl-CoA2. Decreased phytanic-acid oxidation is also observed in human 
cells lacking PEX7, the receptor for the type-2 peroxisomal targetting signal 
(PTS2; refs 3,4), suggesting that the enzyme defective in Refsum disease is 
targetted to peroxisomes by a PTS2. We initially identified the human PAHX and 
mouse Pahx genes as expressed sequence tags (ESTs) capable of encoding PTS2 
proteins. Human PAHX is targetted to peroxisomes, requires the PTS2 receptor for 
peroxisomal localization, interacts with the PTS2 receptor in the yeast 
two-hybrid assay and has intrinsic phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase activity that 
requires the dioxygenase cofactor iron and cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate. Radiation 
hybrid data place PAHX on chromosome 10 between the markers D10S249 and D10S466, 
a region previously implicated in Refsum disease by homozygosity mapping. We 
find that both Refsum disease patients examined are homozygous for inactivating 
mutations in PAHX, demonstrating that mutations in PAHX can cause Refsum 
disease.
