BACKGROUND: Vaccination is proved to be one of the most effective and efficient 
way to prevent illness and reduce health inequality. Studies about association 
between vaccination inequalities in the childhood and awareness of basic public 
health services program among internal migrants in China are lacking. In this 
study, we aimed to explore the association between migrants' vaccination status 
between 0 and 6 years old and their awareness of the National Basic Public 
Health Services (BPHSs) project in China.
METHODS: We included 10,013 respondents aged 15 years old or above of eight 
provinces from 2017 Migrant Population Dynamic Monitoring Survey in China, a 
nationwide cross-sectional study. Univariate and multivariable logistic 
regressions were used to assess vaccination inequalities and the awareness of 
public health information.
RESULTS: Only 64.8% migrants were vaccinated in their childhood, which is far 
below the goal of national requirement of 100% vaccination. This also indicated 
the vaccination inequalities among migrants. Female, the middle-aged, married or 
having a relationship, the highly educated and the healthy population had higher 
awareness of this project than others. Both univariate and multivariate logistic 
regressions showed greatly significant association between vaccination status 
and some vaccines. Specifically, after adding convariates, the results showed 
that there were significant associations between the vaccination rates of eight 
recommended vaccines in the childhood and their awareness of BPHSs project (all 
p values < 0.001), including HepB vaccine (OR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.19, 1.37), HepA 
vaccine (OR: 1.27; 95%CI: 1.15, 1.41), FIn vaccine (OR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.16, 
1.45), JE vaccine (OR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.04, 1.27), TIG vaccine (OR: 1.27; 95%CI: 
1.05, 1.47), DTaP vaccine (OR: 1.30; 95%CI: 1.11-1.53), MPSV vaccine (OR: 1.26; 
95%CI: 1.07-1.49), HF vaccine (OR: 1.32; 95%CI: 1.11, 1.53), except for RaB 
vaccine (OR: 1.07; 95%CI: 0.89, 1.53).
CONCLUSIONS: The vaccination inequalities exist among migrants. There is a 
strong relationship between the vaccination status in the childhood and the 
awareness rate of BPHSs project among migrants. From our findings we could know 
that the promotion of vaccination rates of the disadvantaged population such as 
the internal migrants or other minority population can help them increase the 
awareness of free public health services, which was proved to be beneficial for 
health equity and effectiveness and could promote public health in the future.
