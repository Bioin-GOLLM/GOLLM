Background: Patients on dialysis have impaired cardiac function, in part due to 
increased fluid volume and ventricular stress. Restored kidney function through 
transplantation reduces left ventricular volume in both systole and diastole. We 
previously reported that the decrease in NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) was associated with a decrease in adiponectin. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) 
has been inversely associated with cardiovascular outcomes. We now report the 
association of changes in PON1 with changes in left ventricular volume and left 
ventricular mass after kidney transplantation. Design: Patients on dialysis were 
assessed at baseline and 12 months after kidney transplantation (n = 38). A 
comparison group of patients on dialysis who were not expected to receive a 
transplant in the next 24 months were studied (n = 43) to determine if the 
change of PON1 with kidney transplantation achieved a significance greater than 
that due to biologic variation. Left ventricular volume and mass were determined 
by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. PON1 was measured by arylesterase 
activity and by mass. Results: PON1 mass and activity were not different between 
the groups at baseline. Both PON1 mass and activity were increased post-kidney 
transplantation (p < 0.0001 for change). The change in PON1 mass (p = 0.0062) 
and PON1 arylesterase activity (p = 0.0254) were inversely correlated with the 
change in NT-proBNP for patients receiving a kidney transplant. However, only 
the change in the PON1 mass, and not the change in PON1 arylesterase, was 
inversely correlated with the change in left ventricular volume (ml/m2.7) (p = 
0.0146 and 0.0114 for diastolic and systolic, respectively) and with the change 
in hemoglobin (p = 0.0042). Conclusion: Both PON1 mass and arylesterase activity 
are increased by kidney transplantation. The increase in PON1 mass is consistent 
with a novel relationship to the increase in hemoglobin and decrease in left 
ventricular volume and NT-proBNP seen when kidney function is restored.
