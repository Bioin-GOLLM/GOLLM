Heterotrimeric G(o) is an abundant brain protein required for negatively 
reinforced short-term associative olfactory memory in Drosophila. G(o) is the 
only known substrate of the S1 subunit of pertussis toxin (PTX) in fly, and 
acute expression of PTX within the mushroom body neurons (MB) induces a 
reversible deficit in associative olfactory memory. We demonstrate here that the 
induction of PTX within the α/β and γ lobe MB neurons leads to impaired memory 
acquisition without affecting memory stability. The induction of PTX within 
these MB neurons also leads to a significant defect in an optimized positively 
reinforced short-term memory paradigm; however, this PTX-induced learning 
deficit is noticeably less severe than found with the negatively reinforced 
paradigm. Both negatively and positively reinforced memory phenotypes are 
rescued by the constitutive expression of G(o)α transgenes bearing the 
Cys(351)Ile mutation. Since this mutation renders the G(o) molecule insensitive 
to PTX, the results isolate the effect of PTX on both forms of olfactory 
associative learning to the inhibition of the G(o) activation.
