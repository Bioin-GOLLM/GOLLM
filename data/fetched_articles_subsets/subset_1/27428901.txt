Fungal infections claim an estimated 1.5 million lives each year. Mechanisms 
that protect from fungal infections are still elusive. Recognition of fungal 
pathogens relies on C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and their downstream 
signaling kinase SYK. Here we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB controls 
proximal CLR signaling in macrophages and dendritic cells. We show that CBLB 
associates with SYK and ubiquitinates SYK, dectin-1, and dectin-2 after fungal 
recognition. Functionally, CBLB deficiency results in increased inflammasome 
activation, enhanced reactive oxygen species production, and increased fungal 
killing. Genetic deletion of Cblb protects mice from morbidity caused by 
cutaneous infection and markedly improves survival after a lethal systemic 
infection with Candida albicans. On the basis of these findings, we engineered a 
cell-permeable CBLB inhibitory peptide that protects mice from lethal C. 
albicans infections. We thus describe a key role for Cblb in the regulation of 
innate antifungal immunity and establish a novel paradigm for the treatment of 
fungal sepsis.
