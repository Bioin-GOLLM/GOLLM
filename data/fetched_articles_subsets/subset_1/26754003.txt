Congenital myopathies are a group of inherited muscle disorders characterized by 
hypotonia, weakness and a non-dystrophic muscle biopsy with the presence of one 
or more characteristic histological features. Neuromuscular transmission defects 
have recently been reported in several patients with congenital myopathies (CM). 
Mutations in KLHL40 are among the most common causes of severe forms of nemaline 
myopathy. Clinical features of affected individuals include fetal akinesia or 
hypokinesia, respiratory failure, and swallowing difficulties at birth. Muscle 
weakness is usually severe and nearly half of the individuals have no 
spontaneous antigravity movement. The average age of death has been reported to 
be 5 months in a recent case series. Herein we present a case of a patient with 
a nemaline myopathy due to KLHL40 mutations (c.604delG, p.Ala202Argfs*56 and 
c.1513G>C, p.Ala505Pro) with an impressive and prolonged beneficial response to 
treatment with high-dose pyridostigmine. Myasthenic features or response to ACEI 
have not previously been reported as a characteristic of nemaline myopathy or 
KLHL40-related myopathy.
