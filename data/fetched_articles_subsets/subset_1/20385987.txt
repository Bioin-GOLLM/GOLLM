PURPOSE: Apoptosis pathway, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms (reflux), higher 
body mass index (BMI), and tobacco smoking have been individually associated 
with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) development. However, how multiple factors 
jointly affect EA risk remains unclear.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 305 patients with EA and 339 age- and 
sex-matched controls were studied. High-order interactions among reflux, BMI, 
smoking, and functional polymorphisms in five apoptotic genes (FAS, FASL, IL1B, 
TP53BP, and BAT3) were investigated by entropy-based multifactor dimensionality 
reduction (MDR), classification and regression tree (CART), and traditional 
logistic regression (LR) models.
RESULTS: In LR analysis, reflux, BMI, and smoking were significantly associated 
with EA risk, with reflux as the strongest individual factor. No individual 
single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with EA susceptibility. However, 
there was a two-way interaction between IL1B + 3954C>T and reflux (P = .008). In 
both CART and MDR analyses, reflux was also the strongest individual factor for 
EA risk. In individuals with reflux symptoms, CART analysis indicated that 
strongest interaction was among variant genotypes of IL1B + 3954C>T and 
BAT3S625P, higher BMI, and smoking (odds ratio [OR], 5.76; 95% CI, 2.48 to 
13.38), a finding independently found using MDR analysis. In contrast, for 
participants without reflux symptoms, the strongest interaction was found 
between higher BMI and smoking (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.88 to 5.68), also echoed by 
entropy-based MDR analysis.
CONCLUSION: Although a history of reflux is an important risk for EA, 
multifactor interactions also play important roles in EA risk. Gene-environment 
interaction patterns differ between patients with and without reflux symptoms.
