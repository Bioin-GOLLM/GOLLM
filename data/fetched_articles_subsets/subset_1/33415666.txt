PURPOSE: T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) quantification is a recent 
addition to newborn screening (NBS) programs and is intended to identify infants 
with severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID). However, other primary 
immunodeficiency diseases (PID) have also been identified as the result of TREC 
screening. We recently reported a newborn with a low TREC level on day 1 of life 
who was diagnosed with WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, 
myelokathexis) syndrome, a non-SCID primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations 
in the chemokine receptor CXCR4.
METHODS: We have now retrospectively reviewed the birth and clinical histories 
of all known WHIM infants born after the implementation of NBS for SCID.
RESULTS: We identified six infants with confirmed WHIM syndrome who also had 
TREC quantification on NBS. Three of the six WHIM infants had low TREC levels on 
NBS. All six patients were lymphopenic but only one infant had a T cell count 
below 1,500 cells/μL. The most common clinical manifestation was viral 
bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization. One infant died of complications 
related to Tetralogy of Fallot, a known WHIM phenotype.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that WHIM syndrome should be considered in the 
differential diagnosis of newborns with low NBS TREC levels.
