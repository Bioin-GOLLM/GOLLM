Type 2 diabetes is caused by chronic insulin resistance and progressive decline 
in beta-cell function. Optimal beta-cell function and mass is essential for 
glucose homeostasis and beta-cell impairment leads to the development of 
diabetes. Elevated levels of circulating fatty acids (FAs) and disturbances in 
lipid metabolism regulation are associated with obesity, and they are major 
factors influencing the increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Chronic 
free FA (FFA) treatment induces insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction; 
therefore, reduction of elevated plasma FFA levels might be an important 
therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Lipid signals via receptors, 
and intracellular mechanisms are involved in FFA-induced apoptosis. In this 
paper, we discuss lipid actions in beta cells, including effects on metabolic 
pathways and stress responses, to help further understand the molecular 
mechanisms of lipotoxicity-induced type 2 diabetes.
