BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of rare genetic disorders in the Middle 
East, and their study provides unique clinical and genetic insights. Autosomal 
recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is one of the leading causes of 
kidney and liver-associated morbidity and mortality in Oman. We describe the 
clinical and genetic profile of cohort of ARPKD patients.
METHODS: We studied patients with a clinical diagnosis of ARPKD (n = 40) and 
their relatives (parents (n = 24) and unaffected siblings (n = 10)) from 32 
apparently unrelated families, who were referred to the National Genetic Centre 
in Oman between January 2015 and December 2018. Genetic analysis of PKHD1 if not 
previously known was performed using targeted exon PCR of known disease alleles 
and Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: A clinical diagnosis of ARPKD was made prenatally in 8 patients, 21 
were diagnosed during infancy (0-1 year), 9 during early childhood (2-8 years) 
and 2 at later ages (9-13 years). Clinical phenotypes included polycystic 
kidneys, hypertension, hepatic fibrosis and splenomegaly. Twenty-four patients 
had documented chronic kidney disease (median age 3 years). Twenty-four out of 
the 32 families had a family history suggesting an autosomal recessive pattern 
of inherited kidney disease, and there was known consanguinity in 21 families 
(66%). A molecular genetic diagnosis with biallelic PKHD1 mutations was known in 
18 patients and newly identified in 20 other patients, totalling 38 patients 
from 30 different families. Two unrelated patients remained genetically 
unsolved. The different PKHD1 missense pathogenic variants were: c.107C > T, 
p.(Thr36Met); c.406A > G, p.(Thr136Ala); c.4870C > T, p.(Arg1624Trp) and 
c.9370C > T, p.(His3124Tyr) located in exons 3, 6, 32 and 58, respectively. The 
c.406A > G, p.(Thr136Ala) missense mutation was detected homozygously in one 
family and heterozygously with a c.107C > T, p.(Thr36Met) allele in 5 other 
families. Overall, the most commonly detected pathogenic allele was c.107C > T; 
(Thr36Met), which was seen in 24 families.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genetic screening of PKHD1 in clinically suspected ARPKD 
cases produced a high diagnostic rate. The limited number of PKHD1 missense 
variants identified in ARPKD cases suggests these may be common founder alleles 
in the Omani population. Cost effective targeted PCR analysis of these specific 
alleles can be a useful diagnostic tool for future cases of suspected ARPKD in 
Oman.
