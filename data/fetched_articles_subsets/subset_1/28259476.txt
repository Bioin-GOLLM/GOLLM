BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in DNA repair genes were recently reported in 
8-12% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). 
It is unknown whether these mutations associate with differential response to 
androgen receptor (AR)-directed therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical response of mCRPC patients with germline 
DNA repair defects to AR-directed therapies and to establish whether biallelic 
DNA repair gene loss is detectable in matched circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 319 mCRPC patients and performed 
targeted germline sequencing of 22 DNA repair genes. In patients with 
deleterious germline mutations, plasma cell-free DNA was also sequenced.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Prostate-specific antigen 
response and progression were assessed in relation to initial androgen 
deprivation therapy (ADT) and subsequent therapy for mCRPC using Kaplan-Meier 
analysis.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Of the 319 patients, 24 (7.5%) had deleterious germline 
mutations, with BRCA2 (n=16) being the most frequent. Patients (n=22) with 
mutations in genes linked to homologous recombination were heterogeneous at 
initial presentation but, after starting ADT, progressed to mCRPC with a median 
time of 11.8 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-18.4). The median time to 
prostate-specific antigen progression on first-line AR-targeted therapy in the 
mCRPC setting was 3.3 mo (95% CI 2.7-3.9). Ten out of 11 evaluable patients with 
germline BRCA2 mutations had somatic deletion of the intact allele in ctDNA. A 
limitation of this study is absence of a formal control cohort for comparison of 
clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mCRPC who have germline DNA repair defects exhibit 
attenuated responses to AR-targeted therapy. Biallelic gene loss was robustly 
detected in ctDNA, suggesting that this patient subset could be prioritized for 
therapies exploiting defective DNA repair using a liquid biopsy.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Patients with metastatic prostate cancer and germline DNA 
repair defects exhibit a poor response to standard hormonal therapies, but may 
be prioritized for potentially more effective therapies using a blood test.
