The proposal that the absorption maximum of the visual pigments is governed by 
interaction of the 11-cis-retinal chromophore with charged carboxylic acid side 
chains in the membrane-embedded regions of the proteins has been tested by 
mutating five Asp and Glu residues thought to be buried in rhodopsin. Changing 
Glu113 to Gln causes a dramatic shift in the absorption maximum from 500 
nanometers to 380 nanometers, a decrease in the pKa (acidity constant) of the 
protonated Schiff base of the chromophore to about 6, and a greatly increased 
reactivity with hydroxylamine. Thus Glu113 appears to be the counterion to the 
protonated Schiff base. Wavelength modulation in visual pigments apparently is 
not governed by electrostatic interaction with carboxylate residues, other than 
the counterion.
