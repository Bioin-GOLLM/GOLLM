OBJECTIVE: It has been reported that leflunomide and its active metabolite, 
A771726, are substrates of the ABCG2 (BCRP) transporter in vitro. Recent 
genome-wide association studies have shown that ABCG2 transporter modulates 
serum uric acid (UA) levels. We explored the role of ABCG2 genotypes in the 
pharmacokinetics of A771726 and the relationship between serum UA levels and 
pharmacokinetics of A771726 in healthy participants.
METHODS: Twenty-four healthy individuals were recruited and genotyped for ABCG2. 
After administration of a single dose of 20 mg leflunomide, plasma 
concentrations of A771726 were measured. Serum UA levels were measured just 
before medication, and ABCG2 c.421C>A and c.34G> A polymorphism were genotyped.
RESULTS: ABCG2 c.421C>A but not c.34G>A substantially influenced the 
pharmacokinetics of A771726. A771726 C(max) was 30% higher, area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) 83% larger, and oral clearance (CL/F) 41% lower 
in c.421C>A carriers than in noncarriers. Serum UA levels were also higher in 
carriers than in noncarriers and exhibited a strong and positive correlation 
with A771726 AUC (Spearman r = 0.6746, P = 0.0003), but a negative correlation 
was observed with A771726 CL/F (Spearman r = -0.6616, P = 0.0004).
CONCLUSION: ABCG2 c.421C>A but not c.34G>A polymorphism appears to be a major 
determinant of interindividual variability in A771726 disposition. Additionally, 
serum UA levels exhibited a strong correlation with exposure to A771726.
