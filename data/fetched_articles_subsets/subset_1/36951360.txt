Hereditary factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare recessive bleeding disorder 
with an estimated prevalence of 1/500 000. We had investigated 50 unrelated 
Chinese patients with FVII deficiency and identified, in total, 25 mutations, 
including 18 missense mutations and 5 splicing mutations, on the F7 gene. The 
nucleotide transition c.1224T>G (p.His408Gln) in exon 9 constitutes a hotspot of 
mutation, with 19 patients harbouring this genetic variance. Few patients were 
homozygous or compound heterozygous for deleterious mutations, such as non-sense 
mutations, large insertion or deletions, indicating that complete deficiency of 
FVII may not be compatible with life. The eight novel mutations identified in 
the study, including one small deletion (p.Glu49GlyfsTer101), three type I 
missense mutations, p.Cys238Phe, p.Gly420Asp, p.Ala252Val and four type II 
missense mutations, p.Val336Met, p.Ser342Gly, p.Gly432Ser and p.Ile213Asn, were 
further analysed by in vitro expression and functional studies. The laboratory 
phenotype and structural analysis confirmed the functional consequence of 
p.Ile213Asn mutation involving cleavage and activation site. The molecular 
dynamic simulations and binding energy calculations along with functional 
probing of p.Gly432Ser mutation revealed the critical role of residue Gly432 in 
the binding between activated factor VII (factor VIIa) and tissue factor.
