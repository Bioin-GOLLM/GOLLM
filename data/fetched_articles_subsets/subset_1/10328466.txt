OBJECTIVE: The beta3-adrenergic receptor is involved in regulation of 
microvascular blood flow. A missense mutation (Trp64Arg) in the beta3-adrenergic 
receptor gene has been suggested as a risk factor for proliferative retinopathy 
in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the contribution of this polymorphism to the development of 
microangiopathic complications in Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied the relationship between the Trp64Arg 
polymorphism in type 1 diabetic patients with nephropathy (204 men/132 women, 
age 42.8 +/- 11.0 years, diabetes duration 28 +/- 9 years) and in type 1 
diabetic patients with persistent normoalbuminuria (118 men/73 women, age 42.6 
+/- 10.2 years, diabetes duration 27 +/- 8 years). Proliferative retinopathy was 
present in 254 patients (48%), while 66 patients (13%) had no diabetic 
retinopathy.
RESULTS: There were no differences in Trp64Arg genotype distribution between 
type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy and type 1 diabetic patients 
with normoalbuminuria: 295 (88%)/38 (11%)/3 (1%) vs 161 (84%)/30 (16%)/- had 
Trp/Trp, Trp/Arg or Arg/Arg genotype respectively. Odds ratio (95% CI) of 
nephropathy in carriers of the mutation was 0.75 (0.45-1.25). No associations 
between the Trp64Arg polymorphism and simplex or proliferative retinopathy were 
revealed either. The frequency of the Arg-allele was 0.069 in patients with 
proliferative retinopathy, 0.066 in patients with simplex retinopathy and 0.090 
in patients with no signs of diabetic retinopathy, NS.
CONCLUSIONS: The Trp64Arg polymorphism of the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene 
does not contribute to the genetic susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy in 
Caucasian type 1 diabetic patients. Nor does our study support previous findings 
of an association between this variant and proliferative retinopathy.
