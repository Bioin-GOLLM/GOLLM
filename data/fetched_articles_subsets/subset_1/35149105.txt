BACKGROUND: Air pollution may cause inflammatory and oxidative stress damage to 
the brain, leading to neurodegenerative disease. The association between air 
pollution and dementia, and modification by apolipoprotein E genotype 4 
(APOE-ε4) has yet to be fully investigated.
OBJECTIVES: To examine associations of air pollution with three types of 
incident dementias (Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 
vascular dementia (VAD)), and their potential modification by APOE-ε4 genotype.
METHODS: The UK Biobank enrolled >500,000 participants (2006-2010) with ongoing 
follow-up. We used annual averages of air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, PM2.5-10, 
PM2.5absorbance, NO2, NOX) for 2010 scaled to interquartile ranges (IQR). We 
included individuals aged ≥60 years, with no dementia diagnosis prior to January 
1, 2010. Time to incident dementia and follow-up time were reported from 
baseline (January 01, 2010) to last censor event (death, last hospitalization, 
or loss to follow-up). Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the association of air pollutants 
and incident dementia, and modification of these associations by APOE-ε4.
RESULTS: Our sample included 187,194 individuals (including N = 680 AD, N = 377 
VAD, N = 63 FTD) with a mean follow-up of 7.04 years. We observed consistent 
associations of PM2.5 with greater risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.17, 95% 
CI: 1.10, 1.24) and AD (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29). NO2 was also associated 
with greater risk of any incident dementia (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.25), AD 
(HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.28) and VAD (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.35). APOE-ε4 
did not modify the association between any air pollutants and dementia.
DISCUSSION: PM2.5 and NO2 levels were associated with several types of dementia, 
and these associations were not modified by APOE-ε4. Findings from the UK 
Biobank support and extend to other epidemiological evidence for the potential 
association of air pollutants with detrimental brain health during aging.
