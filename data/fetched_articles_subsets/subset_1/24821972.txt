RIP1 (RIPK1) kinase is a key regulator of TNF-induced NF-κB activation, 
apoptosis, and necroptosis through its kinase and scaffolding activities. 
Dissecting the balance of RIP1 kinase activity and scaffolding function in vivo 
during development and TNF-dependent inflammation has been hampered by the 
perinatal lethality of RIP1-deficient mice. In this study, we generated RIP1 
kinase-dead (Ripk1(K45A)) mice and showed they are viable and healthy, 
indicating that the kinase activity of RIP1, but not its scaffolding function, 
is dispensable for viability and homeostasis. After validating that the 
Ripk1(K45A) mice were specifically protected against necroptotic stimuli in 
vitro and in vivo, we crossed them with SHARPIN-deficient cpdm mice, which 
develop severe skin and multiorgan inflammation that has been hypothesized to be 
mediated by TNF-dependent apoptosis and/or necroptosis. Remarkably, crossing 
Ripk1(K45A) mice with the cpdm strain protected against all cpdm-related 
pathology. Together, these data suggest that RIP1 kinase represents an 
attractive therapeutic target for TNF-driven inflammatory diseases.
