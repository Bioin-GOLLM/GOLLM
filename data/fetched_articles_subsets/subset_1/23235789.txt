INTRODUCTION: Polymorphisms in promoters of genes code for cytokines that affect 
transcription levels. Several have been associated with leprosy patients that 
have functional and clinical implications.
OBJECTIVE: Polymorphisms in the promoter of the IL10 gene of leprosy patients 
will be compared frequencies in normal population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism) -1082 A/G 
(rs1800896), -819C/T (rs1800871), and -592A/C (rs1800872) were identified in 100 
leprosy patients and in a control group of 100 volunteers from a leprosy endemic 
region of Colombia.
RESULTS: The genotypes C/C and C/T in the SNP -819 were associated together with 
leprosy (OR=4.34, p<0.001).Similarly, the genotypes C/C and C/A in the -592 SNP 
showed an association (OR=4.3, p<0.001). The haplotypes -819C-519C and 
-1082A-819C-592C showed significant association (OR=4.34, p<0.001 and OR=6.25, 
p<0.001) respectively. These haplotypes in homozygosis conditions were also 
associated with leprosy: -819C-519C/-819C-519C (OR=4.34, p<0.001), -1082A 
-819C-592C/-1082A -819C-592C (OR=1.90, p=0.04). The SNP -1082 was not associated 
with leprosy in this population.
CONCLUSIONS: The haplotypes associated with leprosy, 
-1082A-819C-592C/-1082A-819C-592C, have been reported as low producers of IL-10. 
Functionally, the low production of IL-10 may have immune response consequences 
and clinical implications. Additional haplotypes of IL-10 have been reported as 
markers for leprosy susceptibility or resistance in other ethnic populations. 
This suggests that differences in distribution of diverse IL-10 gene 
polymorphisms among ethnic groups may indicate important gene-disease 
associations.
