Screening and early diagnosis of gastric cancer play important roles in reducing 
the mortality of gastric cancer. A vast amount of study data on gastric cancer 
screening and early diagnosis has been accumulated in and out of China in the 
past decades. The practice of gastric cancer screening has also been efficiently 
carried out in different countries and regions. However, no widely accepted 
principle of population screening for gastric cancer has been developed yet. 
Screening for gastric cancer requires extensive exploration both theoretically 
and practically. This article focuses on the method and program of gastric 
cancer screening based on population. Moreover, the current situation of gastric 
cancer screening and its evaluation are evaluated.
