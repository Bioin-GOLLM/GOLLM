BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: This study was carried out to investigate whether toll-like 
receptor-1 (TLR1) rs4833095 (N248S) variant, common in the Taiwanese population, 
contributes to pathogenesis of allergy.
METHODS: TLR2/1 ligand Pam3CSK4-stimulated cytokine production in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells of different 
genotypes were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ninety-three 
Taiwanese allergic patients (with asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic 
dermatitis) and 76 controls were recruited for genotyping. Serum immunoglobulin 
E (IgE) levels were evaluated in 60 allergic patients.
RESULTS: The homozygous TLR1 C variant allele carrier had increased 
Pam3CSK4-induced tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-12 responses in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, 
respectively. Furthermore, although the C/C genotype was not associated with 
susceptibility to atopic diseases, it was correlated with lower total IgE levels 
in sera of allergic patients.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the TLR1 N248S polymorphism might play a role 
in Th1/Th2 differentiation, and the determination of serum IgE levels. However, 
interactions with other genetic and environmental factors might be required to 
contribute to risk of allergic diseases in our population.
