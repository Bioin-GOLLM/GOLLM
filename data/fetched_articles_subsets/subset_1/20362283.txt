OBJECTIVE: To describe provocative testing and alternative imaging strategies 
used to localize an androgen-producing tumor in a 58-year-old woman with severe 
hirsutism.
DESIGN: Case report.
SETTING: Clinical Research Center.
PATIENT(S): A 58-year-old woman who was seen for evaluation of severe hirsutism.
INTERVENTION(S): Serum androgen levels were measured at baseline, 4 hours after 
administration of 2000 IU of hCG, and 11 days after administration of 3.75 mg of 
leuprolide acetate (LA). Magnetic resonance imaging and F 
18-fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography-computed tomography 
(FDG-PET/CT) were performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Description of preoperative provocative testing and 
imaging.
RESULT(S): In response to hCG, T rose from 243 to 288 ng/dL then decreased to 
233 ng/dL after LA administration. The FDG-PET/CT scan demonstrated focal 
hypermetabolism in the right pelvis, corresponding to a soft-tissue density on 
the noncontrast CT scan. Magnetic resonance images were correlated with the 
PET/CT, and the right ovary was identified. Right salpingo-oophorectomy was 
performed, and final pathologic examination revealed a hilar cell tumor with 
ovarian cortical hyperplasia.
CONCLUSION(S): This case demonstrates the utility of provocative testing in the 
evaluation of a patient with severe hirsutism and illustrates the value of 
FDG-PET/CT when traditional imaging is nondiagnostic.
