Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the progressive destruction of articular 
cartilage, which is involved in the imbalance between extracellular matrix (ECM) 
synthesis and degradation. MicroRNA-140-5p (miR-140) is specifically expressed 
in cartilage and plays an important role in OA-induced matrix degradation. The 
aim of this study was to investigate (1) whether intra-articular injection of 
melatonin could ameliorate surgically induced OA in mice and (2) whether 
melatonin could regulate matrix-degrading enzymes at the posttranscriptional 
level by targeting miR-140. In an in vitro OA environment induced by 
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), melatonin treatment improved cell proliferation of 
human chondrocytes, promoted the expression of cartilage ECM proteins (e.g., 
type II collagen and aggrecan), and inhibited the levels of IL-1β-induced 
proteinases, such as matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), MMP13, ADAMTS4 (a 
disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4), and ADAMTS5. 
Both the microarray and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments revealed 
that miR-140 was a melatonin-responsive microRNA and melatonin upregulated 
miR-140 expression, which was suppressed by IL-1β stimulation. In vivo 
experiments demonstrated that intra-articular injection of melatonin prevented 
disruptions of cartilage matrix homeostasis and successfully alleviated the 
progression of surgery-induced OA in mice. Transfection of miR-140 antagomir 
completely counteracted the antiarthritic effects of melatonin by promoting 
matrix destruction. Our findings demonstrate that melatonin protects the 
articular cartilage from OA-induced degradation by targeting miR-140, and 
intra-articular administration of melatonin may benefit patients suffering from 
OA.
