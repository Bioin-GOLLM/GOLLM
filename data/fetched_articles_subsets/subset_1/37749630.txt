BACKGROUND: Dimerization of the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 
protein (MyD88) plays a pivotal role in the exacerbated response to innate 
immunity-dependent signaling in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ST2825 is a highly 
specific inhibitor of MyD88 dimerization, previously shown to inhibit the 
pro-inflammatory gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from RA 
patients (RA PBMC). In this study, we elucidated the effect of disrupting MyD88 
dimerization by ST2825 on the pathological properties of synovial fibroblasts 
from RA patients (RA SFs).
METHODS: RA SFs were treated with varying concentrations of ST2825 in the 
presence or absence of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to activate innate 
immunity-dependent TLR signaling. The DNA content of the RA SFs was quantified 
by imaging cytometry to investigate the effect of ST2825 on different phases of 
the cell cycle and apoptosis. RNA-seq was used to assess the global response of 
the RA SF toward ST2825. The invasiveness of RA SFs in Matrigel matrices was 
measured in organoid cultures. SFs from osteoarthritis (OA SFs) patients and 
healthy dermal fibroblasts were used as controls.
RESULTS: ST2825 reduced the proliferation of SFs by arresting the cells in the 
G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In support of this finding, transcriptomic 
analysis by RNA-seq showed that ST2825 may have induced cell cycle arrest by 
primarily inhibiting the expression of critical cell cycle regulators Cyclin E2 
and members of the E2F family transcription factors. Concurrently, ST2825 also 
downregulated the genes encoding for pain, inflammation, and joint catabolism 
mediators while upregulating the genes required for the translocation of nuclear 
proteins into the mitochondria and members of the mitochondrial respiratory 
complex 1. Finally, we demonstrated that ST2825 inhibited the invasiveness of RA 
SFs, by showing decreased migration of LPS-treated RA SFs in spheroid cultures.
CONCLUSIONS: The pathological properties of the RA SFs, in terms of their 
aberrant proliferation, increased invasiveness, upregulation of pain and 
inflammation mediators, and disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis, were 
attenuated by ST2825 treatment. Taken together with the previously reported 
anti-inflammatory effects of ST2825 in RA PBMC, this study strongly suggests 
that targeting MyD88 dimerization could mitigate both systemic and synovial 
pathologies in a variety of inflammatory arthritic diseases.
