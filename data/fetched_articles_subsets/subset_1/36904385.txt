The integration of polymer materials with self-healing features into advanced 
lithium batteries is a promising and attractive approach to mitigate degradation 
and, thus, improve the performance and reliability of batteries. Polymeric 
materials with an ability to autonomously repair themselves after damage may 
compensate for the mechanical rupture of an electrolyte, prevent the cracking 
and pulverization of electrodes or stabilize a solid electrolyte interface 
(SEI), thus prolonging the cycling lifetime of a battery while simultaneously 
tackling financial and safety issues. This paper comprehensively reviews various 
categories of self-healing polymer materials for application as electrolytes and 
adaptive coatings for electrodes in lithium-ion (LIBs) and lithium metal 
batteries (LMBs). We discuss the opportunities and current challenges in the 
development of self-healable polymeric materials for lithium batteries in terms 
of their synthesis, characterization and underlying self-healing mechanism, as 
well as performance, validation and optimization.
