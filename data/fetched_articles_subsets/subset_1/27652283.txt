BACKGROUND: The Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
affecting 1/100.000 live births. It is defined by upper limb anomalies and 
congenital heart defects with variable severity. We describe a dramatic 
phenotype of a male, 15-month-old patient being investigated for strict 
diagnostic criteria of HOS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis revealed a so far unpublished TBX5 
mutation, which occurs de novo in the patient with healthy parents. TBX5 belongs 
to the large family of T-box transcription factors playing major roles in 
morphogenesis and cell-type specification. The mutation located in the 
DNA-binding domain at position 920 (C→A) leads to an amino acid change at 
position 85 (proline → threonine). Three-dimensional analysis of the protein 
structure predicted a cis to trans change in the respective peptide bond, 
thereby probably provoking major conformational and functional alterations of 
the protein. The p.Pro85Thr mutation showed a dramatically reduced activation 
(97%) of the NPPA promoter in luciferase assays and failed to induce NPPA 
expression in HEK 293 cells compared to wild-type TBX5 protein. The mutation did 
not interfere with the nuclear localization of the protein.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the dramatic functional alteration of the 
p.Pro85Thr mutation leads to the distinctive phenotype of the patient.
