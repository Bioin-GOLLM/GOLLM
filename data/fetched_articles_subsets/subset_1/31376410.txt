Members of the highly conserved pleiotropic CK1 family of 
serine/threonine-specific kinases are tightly regulated in the cell and play 
crucial regulatory roles in multiple cellular processes from protozoa to human. 
Since their dysregulation as well as mutations within their coding regions 
contribute to the development of various different pathologies, including cancer 
and neurodegenerative diseases, they have become interesting new drug targets 
within the last decade. However, to develop optimized CK1 isoform-specific 
therapeutics in personalized therapy concepts, a detailed knowledge of the 
regulation and functions of the different CK1 isoforms, their various splice 
variants and orthologs is mandatory. In this review we will focus on the 
stress-induced CK1 isoform delta (CK1δ), thereby addressing its regulation, 
physiological functions, the consequences of its deregulation for the 
development and progression of diseases, and its potential as therapeutic drug 
target.
