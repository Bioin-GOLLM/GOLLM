Staphylococcus aureus infects hospitalized or healthy individuals and represents 
the most frequent cause of bacteremia, treatment of which is complicated by the 
emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. We examined the ability of S. 
aureus to escape phagocytic clearance in blood and identified adenosine synthase 
A (AdsA), a cell wall-anchored enzyme that converts adenosine monophosphate to 
adenosine, as a critical virulence factor. Staphylococcal synthesis of adenosine 
in blood, escape from phagocytic clearance, and subsequent formation of organ 
abscesses were all dependent on adsA and could be rescued by an exogenous supply 
of adenosine. An AdsA homologue was identified in the anthrax pathogen, and 
adenosine synthesis also enabled escape of Bacillus anthracis from phagocytic 
clearance. Collectively, these results suggest that staphylococci and other 
bacterial pathogens exploit the immunomodulatory attributes of adenosine to 
escape host immune responses.
