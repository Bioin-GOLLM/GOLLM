Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are neuronal presynaptic organelles that load and 
release neurotransmitter at chemical synapses. In addition to classic 
neurotransmitters, we have found that synaptic vesicles isolated from the 
electric organ of Torpedo californica, a model cholinergic synapse, contain 
small ribonucleic acids (sRNAs), primarily the 5' ends of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) 
termed tRNA fragments (trfRNAs). To test the evolutionary conservation of SV 
sRNAs we examined isolated SVs from the mouse central nervous system (CNS). We 
found abundant levels of sRNAs in mouse SVs, including trfRNAs and micro RNAs 
(miRNAs) known to be involved in transcriptional and translational regulation. 
This discovery suggests that, in addition to inducing changes in local dendritic 
excitability through the release of neurotransmitters, SVs may, through the 
release of specific trfRNAs and miRNAs, directly regulate local protein 
synthesis. We believe these findings have broad implications for the study of 
chemical synaptic transmission.
