BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the interleukin (IL)28B 
gene have been shown to be associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) infection in western populations. Anti-HCV-reactive and HCV 
RNA-negative samples were often found in Chinese blood donors. This study was to 
determine whether the IL28B gene variant is also associated with the natural 
outcome of HCV infection in Chinese blood donors.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 111 anti-HCV-negative blood donors and 100 
anti-HCV-reactive subjects were enrolled in this study. HCV-infected blood 
donors were classified into spontaneous clearance group and chronic infection 
group through HCV RNA detection. IL28B genetic variations (rs8099917 and 
rs12979860) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 24 (24.0%) donors spontaneously cleared HCV. The rs12979860 
C allele frequency was 90.3% and the rs8099917 T allele frequency was 96.7% in 
our study. The rs12979860 CC genotype was strongly associated with spontaneous 
HCV clearance. Female blood donors had a higher rate of spontaneous HCV 
clearance than male donors (15/42 [35.7%] vs. 9/58 [15.5%], p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The rs12979860 CC variant upstream of IL28B gene is associated with 
spontaneous clearance of HCV in Chinese blood donors and female donors are more 
likely to clear HCV infection than male donors.
