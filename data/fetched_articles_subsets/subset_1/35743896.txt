In the modern era, coronary artery disease (CAD) has become the most common form 
of heart disease and, due to the severity of its clinical manifestations and its 
acute complications, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The 
phenotypic variability of CAD is correlated with the complex etiology, 
multifactorial (caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors) 
but also monogenic. The purpose of this review is to present the genetic factors 
involved in the etiology of CAD and their relationship to the pathogenic 
mechanisms of the disease. Method: we analyzed data from the literature, 
starting with candidate gene-based association studies, then continuing with 
extensive association studies such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and 
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). The results of these studies revealed that the 
number of genetic factors involved in CAD etiology is impressive. The 
identification of new genetic factors through GWASs offers new perspectives on 
understanding the complex pathophysiological mechanisms that determine CAD. In 
conclusion, deciphering the genetic architecture of CAD by extended genomic 
analysis (GWAS/WES) will establish new therapeutic targets and lead to the 
development of new treatments. The identification of individuals at high risk 
for CAD using polygenic risk scores (PRS) will allow early prophylactic measures 
and personalized therapy to improve their prognosis.
