Rv3197 (MABP-1), a non-canonical ABC protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has 
ATPase activity and confers inducible resistance to the macrolide family of 
antibiotics. Here we have shown that MSMEG_1954, the homolog of Rv3197 in M. 
smegmatis, has a similar function of conferring macrolide resistance. Crystal 
structures of apo-MSMEG_1954 (form1 and form 2) and MSMEG_1954 in complex with 
ADP have been determined. These three structures show that MSMEG_1954 has at 
least two different conformations we identify as closed state (MSMEG_1954-form 
1) and open state (MSMEG_1954-form 2 and MSMEG_1954-ADP). Structural 
superimposition shows that the MSMEG_1954-form 2 and MSMEG_1954-ADP complex have 
similar conformation to that observed for MABP-1 and MABP-1-erythromicin complex 
structure. However, the antibiotic binding pocket in MSMEG_1954-form 1 is 
completely blocked by the N-terminal accessory domain. When bound by ADP, the 
N-terminal accessory domain undergoes conformational change, which results in 
the open of the antibiotic binding pocket. Because of the degradation of N 
terminal accessory domain in MSMSG_1954-form 2, it is likely to represent a 
transitional state between MSMEG_1954-form 1 and MSMEG_1954-ADP complex 
structure.
