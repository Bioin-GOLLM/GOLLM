OBJECTIVES: The proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 1 gene (PCSK1) is 
implicated in hypothalamic appetite control. Several studies have addressed the 
relationship between PCSK1 polymorphisms and obesity, although conflicting 
results were observed. We tested the potential association of four PCSK1 
variants with the risk of overweight/obesity and related variables in Portuguese 
children.
METHODS: This is a case-control study, where four PCSK1 variants, rs6230 
(c.-101T>C), rs6232 (p.N221D), rs6235 (p.S690T), and rs3811942 (c.*265T>C), were 
analyzed in Portuguese children (aged 5-13 years-old). Anthropometric measures 
were objectively collected and used to provide weight-for-age, height-for-age, 
and body mass index (BMI) for age. The indices generated were compared to 
standard reference values of WHO to obtain the corresponding Z-scores.
RESULTS: Logistic regression, in the dominant model, revealed no significant 
associations between the four individual PCSK1 variants and the risk of 
overweight/obesity in the total population. However, stratifying the sample by 
sex, a marginally significant association was found between the rs6235 minor 
C-allele and increased overweight/obesity in boys (n = 345) (OR 1.55 [1.01-2.38] 
p = .044), but not in girls (n = 340) (OR 0.73 [0.46-1.14] p = .169). 
Consistently, boys with genotype GG presented lower BMI Z-score (0.62) when 
compared to those with the genotypes GC + CC (1.04). Testing for different 
effects in males versus females, a significant interaction was found between the 
rs6235 polymorphism and sex for BMI Z-score (p = .025).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest for a sex-differentiated association 
between PCSK1 rs6235 and overweight/ obesity in Portuguese children.
