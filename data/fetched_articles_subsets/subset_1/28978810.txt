Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a global health threat, compounded by the 
emergence of drug-resistant strains. A hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 
is the formation of hypoxic necrotic granulomas, which upon disintegration, 
release infectious Mtb. Furthermore, hypoxic necrotic granulomas are associated 
with increased disease severity and provide a niche for drug-resistant Mtb. 
However, the host immune responses that promote the development of hypoxic TB 
granulomas are not well described. Using a necrotic Mtb mouse model, we show 
that loss of Mtb virulence factors, such as phenolic glycolipids, decreases the 
production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 (also referred to as IL-17A). 
IL-17 production negatively regulates the development of hypoxic TB granulomas 
by limiting the expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 
1α (HIF1α). In human TB patients, HIF1α mRNA expression is increased. Through 
genotyping and association analyses in human samples, we identified a link 
between the single nucleotide polymorphism rs2275913 in the IL-17 promoter 
(-197G/G), which is associated with decreased IL-17 production upon stimulation 
with Mtb cell wall. Together, our data highlight a potentially novel role for 
IL-17 in limiting the development of hypoxic necrotic granulomas and reducing 
disease severity in TB.
