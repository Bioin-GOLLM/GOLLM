Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of 
peptide mixtures was used to characterize recombinant barley alpha-amylase 1, 
produced in yeast. Three peptide mixtures were generated by cleavage with CNBr, 
digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C and Asp-N, respectively, and analyzed 
directly by MALDI-MS. Based on the three mass spectrometric peptide maps, an 
error in the sequence deduced from cDNA, resulting in a mass difference of 28 
Da, was located to a sequence stretch of 5 amino acid residues; furthermore, a 
dihexose substituent was identified on Thr410. Subsequent Edman degradation of 
two selected peptides isolated from the endoproteinase Lys-C digest corrected 
the sequence to be Val instead of Ala in position 284 and confirmed the 
O-glycosylation. These results demonstrate that the direct peptide mixture 
analysis by MALDI-MS is a rapid and sensitive method for protein 
characterization and provides valuable information before further 
characterization.
