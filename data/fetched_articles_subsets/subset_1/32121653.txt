In this experimental animal study, we examined alterations in the degree of 
transcription of two microRNAs (miRs)-miR-21 and -223-in a Sprague-Dawley (SD) 
rat model of traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). Depending on the volume of the 
balloon catheter (V), a total of 75 male SD rats were divided into the three 
experimental groups: the sham group (n = 25; V = 0 μL), the mild group (n = 25; 
V = 20 μL), and the severe group (n = 25; V = 50 μL). Successful induction of 
TSCI was confirmed on both locomotor rating scale at 4 h and 1, 3 and 7 days 
post-lesion and histopathologic examinations. Then, RNA isolation and 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. No differences in 
the level of miR-21 expression were found at the first time point studied (4 h 
post-lesion) between the three experimental groups, whereas such differences 
were significant at all the other time points (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were 
significant alterations in the level of miR-223 expression at all time points 
studied through all the experimental groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, locomotor 
rating scale scores had a linear relationship with the level of miR-21 
expression (R2 = 0.4363, Y = 1.661X + 3.096) and that of miR-223 one (R2 = 
0.9104, Y = 0.8385X + 2.328). Taken together, we conclude that up-regulation of 
miR-21 and -223 might be closely associated with progression and the early 
course of TSCI, respectively.
