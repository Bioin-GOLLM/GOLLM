OBJECTIVE: Several studies have indicated an association between 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms and the risk of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the conclusions are inconsistent. 
Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed.
METHODS: Databases like Pubmed, EMBASE, and EBSCO (up to September 2012) were 
searched to retrieve case-control trials about MTHFR (C677T or A1298C) 
polymorphisms and HCC. Literatures were independently screened by two 
researchers according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were 
extracted and analyzed by software STATA 11.0.
RESULTS: Nine studies were included with 10 datasets and 5132 cases. C677T 
polymorphism was associated with HCC risk in a heterozygous model (TT vs. CT: 
OR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.02-1.40). For the A1298C polymorphism, a significantly 
decreased HCC risk was found in the dominant, heterozygous and homozygous models 
(CC vs. AA+AC: OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.33-0.80; CC vs. AC: OR=0.50, 95% CI: 
0.32-0.79; CC vs. AA: OR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.33-0.81). Subgroup analysis stratified 
by ethnicity and type of control further indicated decreased HCC risks in Asians 
(CC vs. AA+AC: OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.26-0.84; CC vs. AC: OR=0.41, 95% CI: 
0.24-0.71; CC vs. AA: OR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.78), studies with controls of 
healthy people (CC vs. AA: OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.93; CC vs. AC: OR=0.54, 95% 
CI: 0.31-0.94; CC vs. AA+AC: OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.94), and controls of 
non-HCC patients (CC vs. AC: OR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.19-0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous carriers of MTHFR C677T mutation are more susceptible to 
HCC, but homozygous mutations of MTHFR A1298C may play a protective role for 
developing HCC.
