The sequence selectivity of DNase 1 cleavage has been investigated by 
site-directed mutagenesis of a chemically synthesised gene. Two key DNA binding 
residues have been conservatively altered (Y76F and R41K) or have had their 
side-chains truncated (Y76A and R41A) and the effect on the cleavage of tyr T 
promoter DNA has been noted. It would appear from these studies that DNase 1 is 
not sensitive to minor groove width via these DNA-contacting residues, and it is 
suggested that DNA helical stiffness is a controlling parameter in determining 
DNase 1 sequence selectivity.
