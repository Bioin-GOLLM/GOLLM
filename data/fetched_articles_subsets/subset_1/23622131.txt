The Kras gene is mutated to an oncogenic form in most pancreatic tumors. 
However, early attempts to use this molecule as a specific biomarker of the 
disease, or inhibit its activity as a cancer therapy, failed. This left a 
situation in which everyone was aware of the association between this important 
oncogene and pancreatic cancer, but no one knew what to do about it. Recent 
findings have changed this picture-many assumptions made about KRAS and its role 
in pancreatic cancer were found to be incorrect. Several factors have 
contributed to increased understanding of the activities of KRAS, including 
creation of genetically engineered mouse models, which have allowed for detailed 
analyses of pancreatic carcinogenesis in an intact animal with a competent 
immune system. Cancer genome sequencing projects have increased our 
understanding of the heterogeneity of individual tumors. We also have a better 
understanding of which oncogenes are important for tumor maintenance and are 
therefore called "drivers." We review the advances and limitations of our 
knowledge about the role of Kras in development of pancreatic cancers and the 
important areas for future research.
