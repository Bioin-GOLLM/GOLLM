Two rare new chiratane-type triterpenoids, kouitchenoids A and B (1, 2), 
together with oleanolic acid (3) and ursolic acid (4), were isolated from 
ethanol extract of Swertia kouitchensis. The new structures were determined by 
the analysis of MS and NMR data. In addition, compounds 1-4 showed moderate 
inhibitory activity against the α-glucosidase (with IC₅₀ values ranging from 
1,812 to 2,027 μM).
