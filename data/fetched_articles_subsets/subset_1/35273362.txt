Proteins expressed by the paired box gene 9 (PAX9) and Msh Homeobox 1 (MSX1) are 
intimately involved in tooth development (odontogenesis). The regulation of PAX9 
and MSX1 protein turnover by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) plausibly maintain 
the required levels of PAX9 and MSX1 during odontogenesis. Herein, we used a 
loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DUB KO library kit to screen for DUBs that 
regulate PAX9 and MSX1 protein levels. We identify and demonstrate that USP49 
interacts with and deubiquitinates PAX9 and MSX1, thereby extending their 
protein half-lives. On the other hand, the loss of USP49 reduces the levels of 
PAX9 and MSX1 proteins, which causes transient retardation of odontogenic 
differentiation in human dental pulp stem cells and delays the differentiation 
of human pluripotent stem cells into the neural crest cell lineage. USP49 
depletion produced several morphological defects during tooth development, such 
as reduced dentin growth with shrunken enamel space, and abnormal enamel 
formation including irregular mineralization. In sum, our results suggest that 
deubiquitination of PAX9 and MSX1 by USP49 stabilizes their protein levels to 
facilitate successful odontogenesis.
