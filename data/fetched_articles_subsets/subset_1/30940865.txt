Regional gender differences in autosomal chromosome disorders have been observed 
repeatedly. However, the corresponding diversity changes remain unconfirmed. By 
analyzing previously published thalassemia data from the Dai people in Dehong 
and Xishuangbanna (two regions in Yunnan Province, China), we found that several 
sequence types, including HBA CNV and HBB mutations, significantly depend on 
gender in Xishuangbanna but not in Dehong. With the supportive evidence from 
previous researches, we accept that some certain mutations depend on gender 
regionally. This association seems peculiar. It is among one common people on a 
small geographical scale, while other recorded thalassemia gender difference 
varies by ethnics and continent.
