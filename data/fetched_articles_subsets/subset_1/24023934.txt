It is of significant interest to understand how proteins interact, which holds 
the key phenomenon in biological functions. Using dynamic fluctuations in high 
frequency modes, we show that the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) predicts hot spot 
residues with success rates ranging between S 8-58%, C 84-95%, P 5-19% and A 
81-92% on unbound structures and S 8-51%, C 97-99%, P 14-50%, A 94-97% on 
complex structures for sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy, 
respectively. High specificity and accuracy rates with a single property on 
unbound protein structures suggest that hot spots are predefined in the dynamics 
of unbound structures and forming the binding core of interfaces, whereas the 
prediction of other functional residues with similar dynamic behavior explains 
the lower precision values. The latter is demonstrated with the case studies; 
ubiquitin, hen egg-white lysozyme and M2 proton channel. The dynamic 
fluctuations suggest a pseudo network of residues with high frequency 
fluctuations, which could be plausible for the mechanism of biological 
interactions and allosteric regulation.
