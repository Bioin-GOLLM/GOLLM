Type 2 diabetes is now a worldwide epidemic, strongly correlated with an 
elevated incidence of obesity. Obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation is 
a major cause of the decreased insulin sensitivity seen in type 2 diabetes. 
Recent studies have shed light on the cross-talk between the immune system and 
organismal metabolism. This review discusses the connection between inflammation 
in adipose tissue and systemic insulin resistance, focusing on the roles of 
innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the pathogenesis of this metabolic 
disease.
