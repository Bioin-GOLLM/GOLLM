Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
represent the most common pollutants in the marine sediments. Previous 
investigations demonstrated short-term sublethal effects of sediments polluted 
with both contaminants on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus after 2 months of 
exposure in mesocosms. In particular, morphological malformations observed in P. 
lividus embryos deriving from adults exposed to PAHs and PCBs were explained at 
molecular levels by de novo transcriptome assembly and real-time qPCR, leading 
to the identification of several differentially expressed genes involved in key 
physiological processes. Here, we extensively explored the genes involved in the 
response of the sea urchin P. lividus to PAHs and PCBs. Firstly, 25 new genes 
were identified and interactomic analysis revealed that they were functionally 
connected among them and to several genes previously defined as molecular 
targets of response to the two pollutants under analysis. The expression levels 
of these 25 genes were followed by Real Time qPCR, showing that almost all genes 
analyzed were affected by PAHs and PCBs. These findings represent an important 
further step in defining the impacts of slight concentrations of such 
contaminants on sea urchins and, more in general, on marine biota, increasing 
our knowledge of molecular targets involved in responses to environmental 
stressors.
