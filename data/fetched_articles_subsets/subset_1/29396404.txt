Ciliopathies are human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, 
ubiquitous microtubule-based organelles involved in signal transduction. Cilia 
are anchored inside the cell through basal bodies (BBs), modified centrioles 
also acting as microtubule-organization centers. Photoreceptors (PRs) are 
sensory neurons, whose primary cilium forms a highly specialized compartment 
called the outer segment (OS) responsible for sensing incoming light. Thus, 
ciliopathies often present with retinal degeneration. Mutations in 
KIAA0586/TALPID3 (TA3) cause Joubert syndrome, in which 30% of affected 
individuals develop retinal involvement. To elucidate the function of TALPID3 in 
PRs, we studied talpid3 zebrafish mutants and identified a progressive retinal 
degeneration phenotype. The majority of PRs lack OS development due to defects 
in BB positioning and docking at the apical cell surface. Intracellular 
accumulation of the photopigment opsin leads to PR cell death of moderate 
severity. Electroretinograms demonstrate severe visual impairement. A small 
subset of PRs display normally docked BBs and extended OSs through rescue by 
maternally-deposited Talpid3. While localization of the small GTPase Rab8a, 
which plays an important role in BB docking, appears unaffected in talpid3-/- 
PRs, overexpression of constitutively active Rab8a rescues OS formation, 
indicating that the role of Ta3 in early ciliogenesis lies upstream of Rab8a 
activation in PRs.
