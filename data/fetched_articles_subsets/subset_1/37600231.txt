Pompe disease is a rare metabolic myopathy caused by pathogenic variants 
affecting the activity of the lysosomal glycogen-degrading enzyme acid 
alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Impaired GAA function results in the accumulation of 
undegraded glycogen within lysosomes in multiple tissues but predominantly 
affects the skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscle. The degree of residual 
enzymatic activity appears to roughly correlate with the age of onset and the 
severity of the clinical symptoms. Here, we report four siblings in which the 
GAA variants NM_000152.5:c.2237G > C p.(Trp746Ser) and NM_000152.5:c.266G > A 
p.(Arg89His) were identified as an incidental finding of clinical exome 
sequencing. These variants are listed in the ClinVar and the Pompe disease GAA 
variant databases but are reported here for the first time in compound 
heterozygosity. All four siblings displayed normal urine tetrasaccharide levels 
and no clinical manifestations related to Pompe disease. Nevertheless, GAA 
enzymatic activity was within the range for late onset Pompe patients. Our 
report shows an association between a novel genotype and attenuated GAA 
enzymatic activity. The clinical significance can only be established by the 
regular monitoring of these individuals. The study highlights the major 
challenges for clinical care arising from incidental findings of next generation 
sequencing.
