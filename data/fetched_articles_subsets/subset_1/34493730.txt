Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is enzootic in dromedary 
camels across the Middle East and Africa. Virus-induced pneumonia in humans 
results from animal contact, with a potential for limited onward transmission. 
Phenotypic changes have been suspected after a novel recombinant clade (lineage 
5) caused large nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea in 2016. 
However, there has been no functional assessment. Here we perform a 
comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo comparison of viruses from parental and 
recombinant virus lineages (lineage 3, n = 7; lineage 4, n = 8; lineage 5, n = 9 
viruses) from Saudi Arabia, isolated immediately before and after the shift 
toward lineage 5. Replication of lineage 5 viruses is significantly increased. 
Transcriptional profiling finds reduced induction of immune genes IFNB1, CCL5, 
and IFNL1 in lung cells infected with lineage 5 strains. Phenotypic differences 
may be determined by IFN antagonism based on experiments using IFN receptor 
knock out and signaling inhibition. Additionally, lineage 5 is more resilient 
against IFN pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells (ca. 10-fold difference in 
replication). This phenotypic change associated with lineage 5 has remained 
undiscovered by viral sequence surveillance, but may be a relevant indicator of 
pandemic potential.
