BACKGROUND: Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of conserved 
serine/threonine phosphatases involved in several essential aspects of cell 
growth and proliferation. PP2ACdc55 phosphatase has been extensively related to 
cell cycle events in budding yeast; however, few PP2ACdc55 substrates have been 
identified. Here, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry approach to 
reveal new substrates of PP2ACdc55 phosphatase and new PP2A-related processes in 
mitotic arrested cells.
RESULTS: We identified 62 statistically significant PP2ACdc55 substrates 
involved mainly in actin-cytoskeleton organization. In addition, we validated 
new PP2ACdc55 substrates such as Slk19 and Lte1, involved in early and late 
anaphase pathways, and Zeo1, a component of the cell wall integrity pathway. 
Finally, we constructed docking models of Cdc55 and its substrate Mob1. We found 
that the predominant interface on Cdc55 is mediated by a protruding loop 
consisting of residues 84-90, thus highlighting the relevance of these 
aminoacids for substrate interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: We used phosphoproteomics of Cdc55-deficient cells to uncover new 
PP2ACdc55 substrates and functions in mitosis. As expected, several 
hyperphosphorylated proteins corresponded to Cdk1-dependent substrates, although 
other kinases' consensus motifs were also enriched in our dataset, suggesting 
that PP2ACdc55 counteracts and regulates other kinases distinct from Cdk1. 
Indeed, Pkc1 emerged as a novel node of PP2ACdc55 regulation, highlighting a 
major role of PP2ACdc55 in actin cytoskeleton and cytokinesis, gene ontology 
terms significantly enriched in the PP2ACdc55-dependent phosphoproteome.
