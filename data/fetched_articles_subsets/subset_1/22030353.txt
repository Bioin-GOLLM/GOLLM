PURPOSE: To report a large consecutive case series of patients who developed 
delayed-onset and acute-onset endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.
DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series.
METHODS: The current study is a retrospective consecutive case series of 
patients treated between January 2000 and December 2009 for culture-proven 
endophthalmitis after cataract surgery. The study defined 2 groups after 
cataract surgery: acute-onset endophthalmitis (≤6 weeks after surgery) and 
delayed-onset endophthalmitis (>6 weeks after surgery).
RESULTS: A total of 118 patients met study criteria; cases included 26 
delayed-onset cases and 92 acute-onset cases. The following clinical features 
and outcomes occurred in delayed- vs acute-onset cases: 1) the presenting visual 
acuity was ≤5/200 in 31% vs 89%; 2) hypopyon was found in 46% vs 80%; 3) the 
most frequent isolate was Propionibacterium acnes (11/26) vs coagulase-negative 
Staphylococcus (57/92); and 4) patients with the most frequent isolate achieved 
a visual outcome of ≥20/100 in 91% vs 56%. In delayed-onset cases, the 
intraocular lens was removed or exchanged in 19 of 26 cases (73%). Of these 19 
cases, 13 achieved a visual outcome of ≥20/100.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with delayed-onset endophthalmitis generally presented 
with better initial visual acuities, had a lower frequency of hypopyon, and had 
better visual outcomes compared to acute-onset patients. Propionibacterium acnes 
and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were the most common organisms 
cultured in delayed- and acute-onset categories, respectively, and were 
associated with the best visual acuity outcomes in each group.
