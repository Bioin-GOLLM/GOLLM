Hereditary spastic paraplegias and related genetically heterogeneous disorders 
may be difficult to distinguish clinically. The FA2H gene has been associated 
with autosomal recessive neurodegenerative phenotypes encompassing spastic 
paraplegia with or without dystonia, and demyelinating leukodystrophy. To date, 
few individuals with mutations in the FA2H gene have been described. We report a 
5-year-old girl of mixed Filipino and Vietnamese origin who presented with 
progressive lower limb spasticity and periventricular leukomalacia. The clinical 
diagnosis of FA2H-associated neurodegeneration was confirmed on the basis of 2 
novel mutations in compound heterozygosity in the FA2H gene (p.S70L/p.P323L). 
This family highlights that FA2H-associated disorders may be underrecognized in 
children with neurodegeneration of many different ethnicities. Magnetic 
resonance imaging features play an important role as diagnostic clues in this 
and other hereditary spastic paraplegias. The consideration of this diagnosis is 
essential in providing families with important information on prognosis, as well 
as accurate genetic counseling.
