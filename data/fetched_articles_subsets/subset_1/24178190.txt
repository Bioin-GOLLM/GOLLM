BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at the evaluation of the relationship between 
genetic polymorphisms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (rs4680:A > 
G-Val158Met, rs6269:A > G, rs4633:C > T, rs4818:C > G) and pain sensitivity 
after lumbar discectomy.
METHODS: All patients had one-level symptomatic disc herniation from L3 to S1. 
The primary data recorded included visual analogue pain scales assessing back 
and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire assessing quality of life and 
pain intensity, received/filled pre- and postoperatively. Each subject was 
genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphism in the COMT gene. Clinical outcome 
was measured by difference between pre- and postoperative values and those 
results were analyzed with genetics findings.
RESULTS: Pain intensity was associated with the COMT polymorphism. Carriers of 
rs6269 AA, rs4633 TT, rs4818 CC, and rs4680 AA genotypes were characterized by 
the lowest preoperative scores related to pain intensity and lower pain 
intensity at 1 year after the surgery. The rs4633 CC, rs4680 GG genotypes 
demonstrated significant clinical improvement in VASBACK score at 1 year after 
the surgery. Patients with COMT haplotype associated with low metabolic activity 
of enzyme (A_C_C_G) showed better clinical outcome measured by ODI score and 
VASBACK score 1 year after surgery. We did not observe any significant 
correlation between leg pain and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the COMT 
gene.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate that polymorphism in the COMT 
gene may play an important role in the mechanism of pain perception, which may 
have a potential implication for clinical decision-making in the future.
