Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are due to either defects in the 
synthesis of the glycan moiety of glycoproteins or glycolipids and in the 
attachment of the glycans to proteins and lipids. Some 50 CDG have been 
identified. They represent a challenge for clinicians because most are 
multisystem diseases with a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical manifestations 
with involvement of any organ and system. We report on a patient with a mutation 
in the glycosyltransferase encoded by the DPAGT1 gene, an infrequent CDG. He 
showed severe fetal hypokinesia phenotype with decreased fetal movements and 
polyhydramnios. At birth he showed decreased facial expression, without 
nasolabial folds, soft long ears, U-shaped vermilion of the upper lip, thick 
skin, hypertrichosis, camptodactyly, moderate multiple contractures, hypotonia 
and severe hypokinesia, no spontaneous movements, and very limited movements 
with stimuli; he died at 1½ months. Isoelectrofocusing of serum transferrin 
showed a type 1 pattern with increased asialo- and disialotransferrin. The study 
of the DPAGT1 gene showed he was a compound heterozygote for two novel point 
missense mutations [c.901C>T]+[c.1094T>G]. This phenotype expands the clinical 
features of the few DPATG1-CDG patients reported.
