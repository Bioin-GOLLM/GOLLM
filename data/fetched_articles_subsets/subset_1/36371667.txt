BACKGROUND: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is one of the most prevalent oral 
mucosal immunological diseases. A recent case-control study in the Egyptian 
population suggested that single nucleotide polymorphism Gly54Asp (rs1800450) of 
the mannose-binding lectin 2 gene might affect the mannose-binding lectin serum 
level and recurrent aphthous stomatitis development. The aim of this study was 
to determine the distribution of six functional mannose-binding lectin 2 gene 
polymorphisms and analyse their role in recurrent aphthous stomatitis 
susceptibility in the Czech population.
METHODS: The study included 227 subjects; 137 healthy people and 90 patients 
with recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Six mannose-binding lectin 2 gene 
polymorphisms (rs11003125, rs7096206, rs7095891, rs5030737, rs1800450, 
rs1800451) were analysed by the SNaPshot assay method, mannose-binding lectin 
serum levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method 
in a subgroup of subjects (N = 87).
RESULTS: No significant differences in mean of mannose-binding lectin serum 
levels between healthy controls and patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis 
were observed (383 ng/ml ± 249 standard deviation (SD) vs. 316 ng/ml ± 177 SD in 
remission phase vs. 343 ng/ml ± 254 SD in active phase; p > 0.05), also the 
allele and genotype frequencies of the studied mannose-binding lectin 2 
polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the two groups (p > 0.05, 
odds ratio (OR): 0.75-1.23). Moreover, the distribution of mannose-binding 
lectin 2 haplotypes and haplogenotypes was similar in the healthy subjects and 
patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (p > 0.05, OR: 0.75-1.23).
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm the previously reported association of 
the mannose-binding lectin 2 Gly54Asp gene variant and low mannose-binding 
lectin serum level as the risk factors for susceptibility to recurrent aphthous 
stomatitis. In addition, no significant relationships between mannose-binding 
lectin 2 functional haplotypes or haplogenotypes and recurrent aphthous 
stomatitis were observed.
