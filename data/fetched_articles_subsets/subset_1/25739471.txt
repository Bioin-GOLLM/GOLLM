In this study, we present a case of developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal 
diabetes (DEND) syndrome in a young male patient with the R50P mutation located 
in the Kir6.2 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel. Whereas most 
patients with DEND syndrome are resistant to sulfonylurea therapy, our patient 
was responsive to sulfonylurea, lacked the most common neurological symptoms, 
such as epilepsy, but refused to drink water. His serum electrolytes and plasma 
osmolarity were normal but the serum vasopressin level was increased. To 
investigate the underlying mechanism of his water intake disorder, a 5 μL 
aliquot of 340 μM KATP channel opener diazoxide or 100 μM KATP channel inhibitor 
glibenclamide was injected into the third ventricle of the rat brain, and water 
intake was monitored. Although the injection of glibenclamide had no effect, 
injection of diazoxide significantly increased water intake by about 1.5 fold 
without affecting food intake. This result indicates that the KATP channel 
activity in the brain may have an influence on water intake. Here, we present 
the first case of a DEND syndrome-afflicted patient with water intake disorder 
and increased serum vasopressin level, possibly related to altered KATP channel 
activity.
