Immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) have 
been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Their 
role in Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) are, however, poorly recognized. We sought 
a genetic association between laboratory markers for the disease, i.e. 
anti-proteinase 3 antibodies (anti-PR3), anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies, 
anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, C-reactive protein (CRP), C3c and 
C4 complement components, and total serum IgE levels in WG subjects with common 
genetic variants of FcepsilonRI subunits. Anti-PR3 and CRP and serum IgE levels 
showed significant associations, while complement components tended to be 
associated, with -18483A > C and/or -344C > T FCER1A (FcepsilonRI alpha-subunit 
gene) polymorphisms. Moreover, a correlation between -109T > C FCER1B 
(FcepsilonRI beta-subunit gene) genotypes and serum IgE was observed. Both WG 
specific auto-antibodies and other blood inflammatory markers displayed 
correlations with serum total IgE levels and genetic variants of the high 
affinity receptor for this immunoglobulin. This observation suggests a 
functional relantionship of FcepsilonRI in the regulation of autoimmune response 
observed in WG.
