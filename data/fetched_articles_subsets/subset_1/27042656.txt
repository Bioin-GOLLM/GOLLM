The interaction of tumor cells with the microenvironment is like a relationship 
between the "seeds" and "soil," which is a hotspot in recent cancer research. 
Targeting at tumor microenvironment as well as tumor cells has become a new 
strategy for cancer treatment. Conventional cancer treatments mostly focused on 
single targets or single mechanism (the seeds or part of the soil); few 
researches intervened in the whole tumor microenvironment and achieved ideal 
therapeutic effect as expected. Traditional Chinese medicine displays a broad 
range of biological effects, and increasing evidence has shown that it may 
relate with synergistic effect on regulating tumor microenvironment and cancer 
cells. Based on literature review and our previous studies, we summarize the 
synergistic effect and the molecular mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine 
on regulating tumor microenvironment and cancer cells.
