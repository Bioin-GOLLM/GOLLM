BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is a key process underlying cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) development, and CVD risk is significantly elevated in persons 
with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Youth with T1D exhibit increased levels of 
inflammation. Studies in persons without diabetes suggest that dietary quality 
influences inflammation, yet little is known about dietary influences on 
inflammation in youth with T1D.
METHODS: This study evaluated the association of four distinct dietary quality 
indices (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Healthy Eating Index 
2010 (HEI2010), modified KIDMED and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC)) with 
biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and 
interleukin-6 (IL-6)) in a sample of 2520 youth with T1D participating in the 
SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.
RESULTS: Average diet quality was moderate to poor, with mean scores of 43 
(DASH, range 0-80), 55 (HEI2010, range 0-100), 3.7 (mKIDMED, range 3-12) and 
7237 (TAC). None of the four diet quality scores was associated with the 
selected biomarkers of inflammation in any analyses. Evaluation of a non-linear 
relationship or interactions with BMI or levels of glycemic control did not 
alter the findings. Replication of analyses using longitudinal data yielded 
consistent findings with our cross-sectional results.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarkers of inflammation in youth with T1D may not be directly 
influenced by dietary intake, at least at the levels of dietary quality observed 
here. More work is needed to understand what physiologic mechanisms specific to 
persons with T1D might inhibit the generally beneficial influence of high 
dietary quality on systemic inflammation observed in populations without 
diabetes.
