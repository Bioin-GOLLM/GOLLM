PURPOSE: The disease entity mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, 
and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is characterized by an early onset of 
stroke-like episodes. MELAS is the most dominant subtype of mitochondrial 
disease. Molecular genetic testing is important in the diagnosis of MELAS. The 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 3243A>G mutation is found in 80% of MELAS patients. 
Nevertheless, molecular analysis alone may be insufficient to diagnose MELAS 
because of mtDNA heteroplasmy. This study aimed to evaluate whether muscle 
biopsy is useful in MELAS patients as an initial diagnostic evaluation method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients who were diagnosed with 
MELAS at the Department of Pediatrics of Gangnam Severance Hospital between 
January 2006 and January 2017 were reviewed. The study population included 12 
patients. They were divided into two subgroups according to whether the results 
of muscle pathology were in accordance with mitochondrial diseases. Clinical 
variables, diagnostic evaluations, and clinical outcomes were compared between 
the two groups.
RESULTS: Of the 12 patients, seven were muscle pathology-positive for 
mitochondrial disease. No statistically significant difference in clinical data 
was observed between the groups that were muscle pathology-positive and muscle 
pathology-negative for mtDNA 3243A>G mutation. Additionally, the patients with 
weakness as the initial symptom were all muscle pathology-positive.
CONCLUSION: The usefulness of muscle biopsy appears to be limited to an initial 
confirmative diagnostic evaluation of MELAS. Muscle biopsy can provide some 
information in MELAS patients with weakness not confirmed by genetic testing.
