It has recently been noted that the relative prevalence of the various kinds of 
epistasis varies along an adaptive walk. This has been explained as a result of 
mean regression in NK model fitness landscapes. Here we show that this 
phenomenon occurs quite generally in fitness landscapes. We propose a simple and 
general explanation for this phenomenon, confirming the role of mean regression. 
We provide support for this explanation with simulations, and discuss the 
empirical relevance of our findings.
