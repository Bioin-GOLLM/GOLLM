We report a role for long-distance retrograde neurotrophin signaling in the 
establishment of synapses in the sympathetic nervous system. Target-derived NGF 
is both necessary and sufficient for formation of postsynaptic specializations 
on dendrites of sympathetic neurons. This, in turn, is a prerequisite for 
formation of presynaptic specializations, but not preganglionic axonal ingrowth 
from the spinal cord into sympathetic ganglia. We also find that NGF-TrkA 
signaling endosomes travel from distal axons to cell bodies and dendrites where 
they promote PSD clustering. Furthermore, the p75 neurotrophin receptor 
restricts PSD formation, suggesting an important role for antagonistic NGF-TrkA 
and p75 signaling pathways during retrograde control of synapse establishment. 
Thus, in addition to defining the appropriate number of sympathetic neurons that 
survive the period of developmental cell death, target-derived NGF also exerts 
control over the degree of connectivity between the spinal cord and sympathetic 
ganglia through retrograde control of synapse assembly.
