HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is amplified and overexpressed in a 
subset of human cancers including breast and gastric cancers, and is indicated 
in its involvement in progression of cancer. Although its specific ligand(s) has 
not been detected, HER2 homodimerization, which is critical for its activation, 
is considered to be dependent on its expression levels. Here, we demonstrate a 
significant role of HER2 methylation by protein lysine methyltransferase SMYD3 
in HER2 homodimerization. We found that SMYD3 trimethylates HER2 protein at 
lysine 175. HER2 homodimerization was enhanced in the presence of SMYD3, and 
substitution of lysine 175 of HER2 with alanine (HER2-K175A) reduced the 
formation of HER2 homodimers. Furthermore, HER2-K175A revealed lower level of 
autophosphorylation than wild-type HER2. We also identified that knockdown of 
SMYD3 attenuated this autophosphorylation in breast cancer cells. Our results 
imply that SMYD3-mediated methylation of HER2 at Lysine 175 may regulate the 
formation of HER2 homodimer and subsequent autophosphorylation and suggest that 
the SMYD3-mediated methylation pathway seems to be a good target for development 
of novel anti-cancer therapy.
