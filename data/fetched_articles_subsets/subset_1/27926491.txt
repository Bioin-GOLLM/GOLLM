Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia characterized 
by progressive neuronal loss. However, the molecular mechanisms for the neuronal 
loss is still debated. Here, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
derived from somatic cells of familial AD patients carrying PSEN1 mutations to 
study the early pathogenic event of AD. We found that premature neuronal 
differentiation with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis occured in 
AD-iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (AD-NPCs) once neuronal differentiation 
was initiated, together with higher levels of AÎ²42 and phosphorylated tau. 
Premature neuronal differentiation in AD-NPCs was caused by PSEN1 mutations and 
might be correlated to multiple dysregulated processes including but not limited 
to Wnt-Notch pathway. Our study documented previously unappreciated early NPC 
dysfunction in AD-NPCs, providing valuable new insights into the early 
mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis.
