O-GlcNAcylation is a reversible post-translational modification. O-GlcNAc 
addition and removal is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase 
(OGA), respectively. More recent evidence indicates that regulation of 
O-GlcNAcylation is important for inflammatory diseases and tumorigenesis. In 
this study, we revealed that O-GlcNAcylation was increased in the colonic 
tissues of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane 
(AOM)/DSS-induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC) animal models. Moreover, the 
O-GlcNAcylation level was elevated in human CAC tissues compared with matched 
normal counterparts. To investigate the functional role of O-GlcNAcylation in 
colitis, we used OGA heterozygote mice, which have an increased level of 
O-GlcNAcylation. OGA(+/-) mice have higher susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis 
than OGA(+/+) mice. OGA(+/-) mice exhibited a higher incidence of colon tumors 
than OGA(+/+) mice. In molecular studies, elevated O-GlcNAc levels were shown to 
enhance the activation of NF-κB signaling through increasing the binding of 
RelA/p65 to its target promoters. We also found that Thr-322 and Thr352 in the 
p65-O-GlcNAcylation sites are critical for p65 promoter binding. These results 
suggest that the elevated O-GlcNAcylation level in colonic tissues contributes 
to the development of colitis and CAC by disrupting regulation of 
NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity.
