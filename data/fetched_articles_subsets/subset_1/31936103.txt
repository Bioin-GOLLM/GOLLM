Antimitotics are important anticancer agents and include the natural alkaloid 
prodrug colchicine (COL). However, a major challenge of using COL as an 
anticancer drug is its cytotoxicity. We developed a novel drug delivery system 
(DDS) for COL using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). The MSNs were 
functionalized with phosphonate groups, loaded with COL, and coated with folic 
acid chitosan-glycine complex. The resulting nanoformulation, called 
MSNsPCOL/CG-FA, was tested for action against cancer and normal cell lines. The 
anticancer effect was highly enhanced for MSNsPCOL/CG-FA compared to COL. In the 
case of HCT116 cells, 100% inhibition was achieved. The efficiency of 
MSNsPCOL/CG-FA ranked in this order: HCT116 (colon cancer) > HepG2 (liver 
cancer) > PC3 (prostate cancer). MSNsPCOL/CG-FA exhibited low cytotoxicity (4%) 
compared to COL (~60%) in BJ1 normal cells. The mechanism of action was studied 
in detail for HCT116 cells and found to be primarily intrinsic apoptosis caused 
by an enhanced antimitotic effect. Furthermore, a contribution of genetic 
regulation (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT 1), 
and microRNA (mir-205)) and immunotherapy effects (angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2 
protein) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was found. Therefore, this 
study shows enhanced anticancer effects and reduced cytotoxicity of COL with 
targeted delivery compared to free COL and is a novel method of developing 
cancer immunotherapy using a low-cost small-molecule natural prodrug.
