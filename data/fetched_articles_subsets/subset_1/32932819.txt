Therapy of hormone receptor positive breast cancer (BCa) generally targets 
estrogen receptor (ER) function and signaling by reducing estrogen production or 
by blocking its interaction with the ER. Despite good long-term responses, 
resistance to treatment remains a significant issue, with approximately 40% of 
BCa patients developing resistance to ET. Mutations in the gene encoding ERα, 
ESR1, have been identified in BCa patients and are implicated as drivers of 
resistance and disease recurrence. Understanding the molecular consequences of 
these mutations on ER protein levels and its activity, which is tightly 
regulated, is vital. ER activity is in part controlled via its short protein 
half-life and therefore changes to its stability, either through mutations or 
alterations in pathways involved in protein stability, may play a role in 
therapy resistance. Understanding these connections and how ESR1 alterations 
could affect protein stability may identify novel biomarkers of resistance. This 
review explores the current reported data regarding posttranslational 
modifications (PTMs) of the ER and the potential impact of known resistance 
associated ESR1 mutations on ER regulation by affecting these PTMs in the 
context of ET resistance.
