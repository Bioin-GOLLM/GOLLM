Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or the nondiarrheal form of hemolytic uremic 
syndrome, is a rare disorder typically classified as familial or sporadic. 
Recent literature has suggested that approximately 50% of patients have 
mutations in factor H (CFH), factor I (CFI), or membrane cofactor protein 
(encoded by CD46). Importantly, results of renal transplantation in patients 
with mutations in either CFH or CFI are dismal, with recurrent disease leading 
to graft loss in the majority of cases. We describe an adult renal transplant 
recipient who developed recurrent hemolytic uremic syndrome 1 month after 
transplantation. Bidirectional sequencing of CFH, CFI, and CD46 confirmed that 
the patient was heterozygous for a novel missense mutation, a substitution of a 
serine reside for a tyrosine residue at amino acid 369, in CFI. This report 
reemphasizes the importance of screening patients with atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome for mutations in these genes before renal transplantation and shows the 
challenges in the management of these patients.
