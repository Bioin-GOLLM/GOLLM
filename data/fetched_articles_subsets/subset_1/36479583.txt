Identifying genes associated with wax deposition may contribute to the genetic 
improvement of ornamental kale. Here, we characterized a candidate gene for wax 
contents, BoORP3a, encoding an oxysterol-binding protein. We sequenced the 
BoORP3a gene and coding sequence from the high-wax line S0835 and the low-wax 
line F0819, which revealed 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms between the two 
lines, of which six caused five amino acids substitutions. BoORP3a appeared to 
be relatively well conserved in Brassicaceae, as determined by a phylogenetic 
analysis, and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nucleus. To confirm 
the role of BoORP3a in wax deposition, we generated three orp3a mutants in a 
high-wax kale background via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Importantly, 
all three mutants exhibited lower wax contents and glossy leaves. Overall, these 
data suggest that BoORP3a may participate in cuticular wax deposition in 
ornamental kale.
