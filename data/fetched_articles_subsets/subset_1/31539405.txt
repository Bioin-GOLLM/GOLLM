BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a pathological enlargement of 
infrarenal aorta close to the aortic bifurcation, and it is an important cause 
of mortality in the elderly. Therefore, the biomarker identification for early 
diagnosis is of great interest for clinical benefit. It is known that microRNAs 
(miRNAs) have important roles via target genes regulation in many diseases. This 
study aimed to identify miRNAs and their target genes involved in the 
pathogenesis of AAA.
METHODS: Tissue samples were obtained from patients who underwent AAA surgery 
and from organ donors (control group). Quantitative PCR Array was applied to 
assess 84 genes and 384 miRNAs aiming to identify differentially expressed 
targets (AAA n = 6, control n = 6), followed by validation in a new cohort (AAA 
n = 18, control n = 6) by regular qPCR. The functional interaction between 
validated miRNAs and target genes was performed by the Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA) software.
RESULTS: The screening cohort assessed by PCR array identified 10 genes and 59 
miRNAs differentially expressed (â‰¥2-fold change, p<0.05). Among these, IPA 
identified 5 genes and 9 miRNAs with paired interaction. ALOX5, PTGIS, CX3CL1 
genes, and miR-193a-3p, 125b-5p, 150-5p maintained a statistical significance in 
the validation cohort. IPA analysis based on the validated genes and miRNAs 
revealed that eicosanoid and metalloproteinase/TIMP synthesis are potentially 
involved in AAA.
CONCLUSION: Paired interactions of differentially expressed ALOX5, PTGIS, CX3CL1 
genes, and miR-193b-3p, 125b-5p, 150-5p revealed a potentially significant role 
of the eicosanoid synthesis and metalloproteinase/TIMP pathways in the AAA 
pathogenesis.
