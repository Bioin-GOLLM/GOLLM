A study on the electronic properties of the dilute-P GaN(1-x)P(x)alloy using 
First-Principle Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations is presented. Our 
results indicate a band gap energy coverage from 3.645 eV to 2.697 eV, with 
P-content varying from 0% to 12.5% respectively. In addition, through line 
fitting of calculated and experimental data, a bowing parameter of 9.5 ± 0.5 eV 
was obtained. The effective masses for electrons and holes are analyzed, as well 
as the split-off energy parameters where findings indicate minimal interband 
Auger recombination. The alloy also possesses the direct energy band gap 
property, indicating its strong potential as a candidate for future photonic 
device applications.
