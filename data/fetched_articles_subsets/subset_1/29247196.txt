Age related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the 
developed world. Although its precise cause remains elusive, dysfunction of the 
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and dysregulation of complement have been 
implicated in its pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role 
of an AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
riboside (AICAR), on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) induction of complement 
factor B (CFB) in RPE cells. We found that AICAR inhibited TNF-α-induced CFB 
expression in ARPE-19 and human primary RPE cells in a dose-dependent fashion. 
Treatment of cells with dipyridamole, which blocks AICAR cellular uptake 
abolished these effects. In contrast, the adenosine kinase inhibitor, 
5-iodotubericidin, which inhibits the conversion of AICAR to the direct 
activator of AMPK, ZMP, did not reverse the effects on TNF-α-induced CFB 
expression, suggesting AMPK-independent effects. Indeed, knockout of AMPK in RPE 
cells using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 
did not abolish the inhibitory effects of AICAR on RPE CFB expression. 
Collectively, our results suggest that AICAR can suppress TNF-α-induced CFB 
expression in RPE cells in an AMPK-independent mechanism, and could be used as a 
therapeutic target in certain complement over-activation scenarios.
