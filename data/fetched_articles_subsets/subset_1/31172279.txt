Influenza infection is common worldwide with many individuals affected each year 
during epidemics and occasionally pandemics. Previous studies in animal models 
and a few human cases have established an important role of innate type I and 
III interferon (IFN) for viral elimination and mounting of antiviral responses. 
However, genetic and immunological determinants of very severe disseminated 
influenza virus infection in humans remain incompletely understood. Here, we 
describe an adult patient with severe influenza virus A (IAV) infection, in whom 
we identified a rare variant E331V in IFN regulatory factor (IRF)7 by 
whole-exome sequencing. Examination of patient cells demonstrated a cellular 
phenotype suggesting functional IRF7 impairment, since priming with IFN was 
almost abolished and IFN responses to IAV were significantly impaired in patient 
cells. Moreover, IAV replication was significantly higher in patient cells than 
in controls. Finally, expression of IRF7 E331V in HEK293 cells demonstrated 
significantly reduced activation of both IFNA7 and IFNB promoters in a 
luciferase reporter gene expression assay compared to IRF7 wild type. These 
findings provide further support for the essential role of IRF7 in amplifying 
antiviral IFN responses to ensure potent and sustained IFN responses during 
influenza virus infection in humans.
