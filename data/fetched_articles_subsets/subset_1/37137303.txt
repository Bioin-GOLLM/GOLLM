Recurrent spontaneous miscarriage (RSM) affects 1%-2% of fertile women worldwide 
and poses a risk of future pregnancy complications. Increasing evidence has 
indicated that defective endometrial stromal decidualization is a potential 
cause of RSM. Here, we perform liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS)-based metabolite profiling in human endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and 
differentiated ESCs (DESCs) and find that accumulated α-ketoglutarate (αKG) 
derived from activated glutaminolysis contributes to maternal decidualization. 
Contrarily, ESCs obtained from patients with RSM show glutaminolysis blockade 
and aberrant decidualization. We further find that enhanced Gln-Glu-αKG flux 
decreases histone methylation and supports ATP production during 
decidualization. In vivo, feeding mice a Glu-free diet leads to a reduction of 
αKG, impaired decidualization, and an increase of fetal loss rate. Isotopic 
tracing approaches demonstrate Gln-dependent oxidative metabolism as a prevalent 
direction during decidualization. Our results demonstrate an essential 
prerequisite of Gln-Glu-αKG flux to regulate maternal decidualization, 
suggesting αKG supplementation as a putative strategy to rectify deficient 
decidualization in patients with RSM.
