Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common and, therefore, 
important inherited disorders in preventive cardiology. This disease is mainly 
caused by a single pathogenic mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor 
or its associated genes. Moreover, it is correlated with a high risk of 
cardiovascular disease. However, the phenotype severity even in this monogenic 
disease significantly varies. Thus, the current study aimed to describe FH and 
its importance and the factors (inherited and acquired) contributing to 
differences in phenotype severity. Different lipid-modification therapies 
according to these factors can lead to individualized treatments, which are also 
essential in the general populations.
