Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the most abundant prostaglandin in the brain, but its 
involvement in brain damage caused by type 2 diabetes (T2D) has not been 
reported. In the present study, we found that increased PGD2 content is related 
to the inhibition of autophagy, which aggravates brain damage in T2D, and may be 
involved in the imbalanced expression of the corresponding PGD2 receptors DP1 
and DP2. We demonstrated that DP2 inhibited autophagy and promotedT2D-induced 
brain damage by activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, whereas DP1enhanced 
autophagy and amelioratedT2D brain damage by activating the cAMP/PKA pathway. In 
a T2D rat model, DP1 expression was decreased, and DP2 expression was increased; 
therefore, the imbalance in PGD2-DPs may be involved in T2D brain damage through 
the regulation of autophagy. However, there have been no reports on whether PKA 
can directly inhibit mTOR. The PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-C) has three subtypes 
(α, β and γ), and γ is not expressed in the brain. Subsequently, we suggested 
that PKA could directly interact with mTOR through PKA-C(α) and PKA-C(β). Our 
results suggest that the imbalance in PGD2-DPs is related to changes in 
autophagy levels in T2D brain damage, and PGD2 is involved in T2D brain damage 
by promoting autophagy via DP1-PKA/mTOR and inhibiting autophagy via 
DP2-PI3K/AKT/mTOR.
