Small extracellular vesicles called exosomes affect multiple autocrine and 
paracrine cellular phenotypes. Understanding the function of exosomes requires a 
variety of tools, including live imaging. Our previous live-cell reporter, 
pHluorin-CD63, allows dynamic subcellular monitoring of exosome secretion in 
migrating and spreading cells. However, dim fluorescence and the inability to 
make stably-expressing cell lines limit its use. We incorporated a stabilizing 
mutation in the pHluorin moiety, M153R, which now exhibits higher, stable 
expression in cells and superior monitoring of exosome secretion. Using this 
improved construct, we visualize secreted exosomes in 3D culture and in vivo and 
identify a role for exosomes in promoting leader-follower behavior in 2D and 3D 
migration. Incorporating an additional non-pH-sensitive red fluorescent tag 
allows visualization of the exosome lifecycle, including multivesicular body 
(MVB) trafficking, MVB fusion, exosome uptake and endosome acidification. This 
reporter will be a useful tool for understanding both autocrine and paracrine 
roles of exosomes.
