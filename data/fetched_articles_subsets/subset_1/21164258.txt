Functional and physiological consequences of StAR deficiency: role in lipoid 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

King SR, Bhangoo A, Stocco DM.

The steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein is essential for all 
hormone-stimulated steroid biosynthesis. Accordingly, its absence gives rise to 
the most severe form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), lipoid CAH. This 
life-threatening condition typically manifests itself in the perinatal period. 
Partial loss-of-function StAR mutations incompletely manifest the condition 
later in life and are a cause of familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 3. 
Here, we discuss StAR, its expression pattern and the clinical consequences of 
the loss of its activity.
