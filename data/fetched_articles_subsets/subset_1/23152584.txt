OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to validate the immunohistochemical 
assay for the diagnosis of nondystrophic myotonia and to provide full 
clarification of clinical disease to patients in whom basic genetic testing has 
failed to do so.
METHODS: An immunohistochemical assay of sarcolemmal chloride channel abundance 
using 2 different ClC1-specific antibodies.
RESULTS: This method led to the identification of new mutations, to the 
reclassification of W118G in CLCN1 as a moderately pathogenic mutation, and to 
confirmation of recessive (Becker) myotonia congenita in cases when only one 
recessive CLCN1 mutation had been identified by genetic testing.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a robust immunohistochemical assay that can 
detect loss of sarcolemmal ClC-1 protein on muscle sections. This in combination 
with gene sequencing is a powerful approach to achieving a final diagnosis of 
nondystrophic myotonia.
