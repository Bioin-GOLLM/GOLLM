Monkeypox was declared a global health emergency by the World Health 
Organization, and as of March 2023, 86,000 confirmed cases and 111 deaths across 
110 countries have been reported. Its causal agent, monkeypox virus (MPV) 
belongs to a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses, Orthopoxviridae, that 
also includes vaccinia virus (VACV) and others. MPV produces two distinct forms 
of viral particles during its replication cycles: the enveloped viron (EV) that 
is released via exocytosis, and the mature viron (MV) that is discharged through 
lysis of host cells. This study was designed to develop multi-valent mRNA 
vaccines against monkeypox EV and MV surface proteins, and examine their 
efficacy and mechanism of action. Four mRNA vaccines were produced with 
different combinations of surface proteins from EV (A35R and B6R), MV (A29L, 
E8L, H3L and M1R), or EV and MV, and were administered in Balb/c mice to assess 
their immunogenicity potentials. A dynamic immune response was observed as soon 
as seven days after initial immunization, while a strong IgG response to all 
immunogens was detected with ELISA after two vaccinations. The higher number of 
immunogens contributed to a more robust total IgG response and correlating 
neutralizing activity against VACV, indicating the additive potential of each 
immunogen in generating immune response and nullifying VACV infection. Further, 
the mRNA vaccines elicited an antigen-specific CD4+ T cell response that is 
biased towards Th1. The mRNA vaccines with different combinations of EV and MV 
surface antigens protected a mouse model from a lethal dose VACV challenge, with 
the EV and MV antigens-combined vaccine offering the strongest protection. These 
findings provide insight into the protective mechanism of multi-valent mRNA 
vaccines against MPV, and also the foundation for further development of 
effective and safe mRNA vaccines for enhanced protection against monkeypox virus 
outbreak.
