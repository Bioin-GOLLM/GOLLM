BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic period is having a strong impact on the 
management of diabetes as well as other chronic diseases as shown by the most 
severe clinical presentation at onset. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
severity of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in youth with newly diagnosed type 1 
diabetes in "Santissima Annunziata Hospital" (Chieti, Italy) during COVID-19 
pandemic in comparison to the five previous years.
METHODS: A retrospective population-based incidence study was performed. Data 
were obtained from hospital records of 172 patients with new onset type 1 
diabetes divided into two groups according to the diagnosis: Group I, between 
January 2015 and February 2020; Group II, between March 2020 and April 2021. 
Data regarding anthropometric, socio-economic and laboratory test were analyzed. 
DKA (pH < 7.30) and different severity of the disease (severe pH < 7.10; 
moderate pH < 7.20, mild pH < 7.30) were evaluated. A Spearman correlation 
between pH values and the main variables of interest was performed.
RESULTS: DKA frequency was increased by 19 percentage in Group II compared to 
Group I (55% vs 36%; P = 0.03) with a significant increased risk of severe DKA 
cases compared to the previous five years (severe DKA 22.5% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.01). 
pH values were significantly related with HbA1c, blood glucose and c-peptide 
values in all groups. In addition, in Group II but not in Group I, pH values 
correlated with Triglycerides and TG/HDL cholesterol ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic the risk of more severe clinical 
presentation of type 1 diabetes at onset is increased. The correlation with 
lipid profile might suppose an additional effect of lifestyle changes beside the 
delay in the diagnosis. Modifications of health care system need to be 
implemented during this peculiar situation in order to avoid such a relevant 
complication at onset.
