Despite efforts for over 25 years, de novo protein design has not succeeded in 
achieving the TIM-barrel fold. Here we describe the computational design of 
four-fold symmetrical (β/α)8 barrels guided by geometrical and chemical 
principles. Experimental characterization of 33 designs revealed the importance 
of side chain-backbone hydrogen bonds for defining the strand register between 
repeat units. The X-ray crystal structure of a designed thermostable 184-residue 
protein is nearly identical to that of the designed TIM-barrel model. PSI-BLAST 
searches do not identify sequence similarities to known TIM-barrel proteins, and 
sensitive profile-profile searches indicate that the design sequence is distant 
from other naturally occurring TIM-barrel superfamilies, suggesting that Nature 
has sampled only a subset of the sequence space available to the TIM-barrel 
fold. The ability to design TIM barrels de novo opens new possibilities for 
custom-made enzymes.
