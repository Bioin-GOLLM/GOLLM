Steroid 5α-reductase deficiency (5ARD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder 
caused by mutation in the 5α-reductase type 2 gene (SRD5A2). 5ARD results in the 
impaired conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and is 
characterized by undervirilization in 46XY individuals. We report a case series 
of three siblings presenting with ambiguous genitalia and different phenotypes. 
They did not meet the widely accepted biochemical criteria for 5ARD. In view of 
strong clinical suspicion, genetic analysis was performed which revealed 
pathogenic mutation in SRD5A2. This report highlights the importance of 
definitive diagnosis with molecular methods as the treatment and prognosis 
differs greatly among the close differential diagnoses. Reliance on the 
biochemical criteria alone may lead to misdiagnosis.
