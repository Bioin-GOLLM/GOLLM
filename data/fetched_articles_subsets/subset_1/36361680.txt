Recent advances in glioblastoma (GB) research have shed light on the molecular 
characteristics, the defected intracellular signaling pathways, and the genetic 
and epigenetic alterations involved in their pathogenesis. Despite constant 
efforts, GB remains an aggressive malignant tumor with limited therapeutic 
approaches, poor prognosis, and a low survival rate. Emerging evidence points 
towards the crucial impact of epigenetic post-translational modifications in 
cancer development with emphasis on the regulatory role of histone deacetylation 
in several key cellular processes, including metabolic pathways, regulation of 
stress response, senescence, proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The 
silent information regulator proteins (Sirtuins) are deacetylases of histone and 
non-histone proteins that have been recently implicated in the initiation as 
well as in the progression of GB. Herein, we provide a critical overview of the 
emerging functional role and mechanism of action of the seven Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) 
in GB and discuss their potential targeting options in clinical practice.
