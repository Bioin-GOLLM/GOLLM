BACKGROUND: Cell therapies are being investigated as potential disease modifying 
treatment options for osteoarthritis (OA). Progenza (PRG) comprises in vitro 
expanded mesenchymal stem cells derived from human donor adipose tissue combined 
with cell culture supernatant. The primary objective of this first-in-human 
study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRG.
METHODS: We conducted a single centre, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study. Twenty patients aged 
40-65 years with symptomatic Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1-3 knee OA were treated in 
two cohorts and randomized 4:1 to PRG or placebo. Cohort 1: 3.9 million cells 
(PRG 3.9M, n = 8) or placebo (n = 2) and cohort 2: 6.7 million cells (PRG 6.7M, 
n = 8) or placebo (n = 2). Each patient received a single intra-articular 
injection and was followed-up for 12 months.
RESULTS: The study population comprised 20 patients (placebo, n = 4; PRG 3.9M, 
n = 8; PRG 6.7M, n = 8). All patients reported at least one treatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). The majority of events [143/169 (84.6%)] were mild with 34 
(20.1%) being considered by the investigator to be treatment related. There were 
no serious AEs or withdrawals due to AEs during the study. There was a 
statistically significant within group improvement in VAS pain scores from 
baseline at all timepoints for the PRG combined group, with highly significant 
improvements seen at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 (p ≤ 0.005) while VAS pain scores in 
the placebo group showed marginal improvement. A statistically significant 
improvement was also seen in WOMAC pain subscale scores from baseline at all 
timepoints for the PRG combined group while a marginal improvement in the 
placebo group was not statistically significant. Between screening and month 12, 
there was no decrease in average lateral tibial cartilage volume in the PRG 3.9M 
group while the placebo group showed a statistically significant cartilage loss. 
This difference between the placebo and PRG 3.9M group was statistically 
significant (LSM difference 106.47 mm3, 95% CI 13.56 mm3, 199.37 mm3, 
p = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: When administered as a single intra-articular injection to patients 
with symptomatic knee OA, PRG was safe and well tolerated. Furthermore, 
measurable improvements in symptoms and knee structure outcomes warrant further 
studies on PRG's potential for disease modification in OA. Trial registration
