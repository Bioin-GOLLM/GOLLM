BACKGROUND: Succinyl-coenzyme A ligase (SUCL) is a mitochondrial enzyme that 
catalyses the reversible conversion of succinyl-coenzyme A to succinate. SUCL 
consists of an α subunit, encoded by SUCLG1, and a β subunit, encoded by either 
SUCLA2 or SUCLG2. Recently, mutations in SUCLG1 or SUCLA2 have been identified 
in patients with infantile lactic acidosis showing elevated urinary excretion of 
methylmalonate, mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) deficiency, and 
mitochondrial DNA depletion.
METHODS: Case description of a Japanese female patient who manifested a 
neonatal-onset lactic acidosis with urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid. 
Enzymatic analyses (MRC enzyme assay and Western blotting) and direct sequencing 
analysis of SUCLA2 and SUCLG1 were performed.
RESULTS: MRC enzyme assay and Western blotting showed that MRC complex I was 
deficient. SUCLG1 mutation analysis showed that the patient was a compound 
heterozygote for disease-causing mutations (p.M14T and p.S200F).
CONCLUSION: For patients showing neonatal lactic acidosis and prolonged mild 
methylmalonic aciduria, MRC activities and mutations of SUCLG1 or SUCLA2 should 
be screened for.
