5'-(Alkylthio)-, 5'-(methylseleno)-, and 5'-(alkylamino)-substituted analogues 
of N6-cyclopen-tyladenosine (CPA) were synthesized in 30-50% overall yields. The 
affinities of these compounds for the adenosine A1 and A2A receptors were 
determined in rat brain membranes. The 5'-substituted CPA analogues proved 
selective for the adenosine A1 receptors, displaying affinities in the nanomolar 
range. The compounds were also evaluated for their ability to stimulate [35S]GTP 
gamma S binding, also in rat brain membranes. The Ki values in receptor binding 
studies corresponded well to the EC50 values thus obtained. Intrinsic activities 
of the compounds were tested in vitro by determining the GTP shift in receptor 
binding studies as well as the maximal binding of [35S]GTP gamma S. It appeared 
that the 5'-thio and 5'-seleno derivatives in particular behaved as partial 
agonists.
