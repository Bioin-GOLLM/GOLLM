Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in 
either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, two key regulators of the mechanistic target of 
the rapamycin complex pathway. Phenotypically, this leads to growth and 
formation of hamartomas in several organs, including the brain. Subependymal 
giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) are low-grade brain tumors commonly associated 
with TSC. Recently, gene expression studies provided evidence that the immune 
system, the MAPK pathway and extracellular matrix organization play an important 
role in SEGA development. However, the precise mechanisms behind the gene 
expression changes in SEGA are still largely unknown, providing a potential role 
for DNA methylation. We investigated the methylation profile of SEGAs using the 
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (SEGAs n = 42, periventricular 
control n = 8). The SEGA methylation profile was enriched for the adaptive 
immune system, T cell activation, leukocyte mediated immunity, extracellular 
structure organization and the ERK1 & ERK2 cascade. More interestingly, we 
identified two subgroups in the SEGA methylation data and show that the 
differentially expressed genes between the two subgroups are related to the MAPK 
cascade and adaptive immune response. Overall, this study shows that the immune 
system, the MAPK pathway and extracellular matrix organization are also affected 
on DNA methylation level, suggesting that therapeutic intervention on DNA level 
could be useful for these specific pathways in SEGA. Moreover, we identified two 
subgroups in SEGA that seem to be driven by changes in the adaptive immune 
response and MAPK pathway and could potentially hold predictive information on 
target treatment response.
