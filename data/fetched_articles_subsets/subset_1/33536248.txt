The LMNA gene encodes the A-type lamins, which polymerize into ∼3.5-nm-thick 
filaments and, together with B-type lamins and associated proteins, form the 
nuclear lamina. Mutations in LMNA cause a wide variety of pathologies. In this 
study, we analyzed the nuclear lamina of embryonic fibroblasts from 
LmnaH222P/H222P mice, which develop cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy. 
Although the organization of the lamina appeared unaltered, there were changes 
in chromatin and B-type lamin expression. An increase in nuclear size and 
consequently a relative reduction in heterochromatin near the lamina allowed for 
a higher resolution structural analysis of lamin filaments using cryo-electron 
tomography. This was most apparent when visualizing lamin filaments in situ and 
using a nuclear extraction protocol. Averaging of individual segments of 
filaments in LmnaH222P/H222P mouse fibroblasts resolved two polymers that 
constitute the mature filaments. Our findings provide better views of the 
organization of lamin filaments and the effect of a striated muscle 
disease-causing mutation on nuclear structure.
