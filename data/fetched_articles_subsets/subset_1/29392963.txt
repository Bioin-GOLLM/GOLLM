Objective To evaluate the antioxidant and apoptotic inductive effects of 
Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) leaf extract against a hepatocellular carcinoma 
cell line. Methods After treating HepG2cells with Ashwagandha water extract 
(ASH-WX; 6.25 mg/ml-100 mg/ml), cell proliferation was assessed using a 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 
Antioxidant activities (total antioxidant, glutathione S-transferase and 
glutathione reductase), Fas-ligand level, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level 
and caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were measured. Molecular modelling assessed 
the binding-free energies of Ashwagandha in the cyclin D1 receptor. Results The 
MTT assay demonstrated increased cytotoxicity following treatment of HepG2 cells 
with ASH-WX compared with control untreated cells and theIC50was 5% 
(approximately 5.0 mg/ml). Antioxidant activities, Fas-ligand levels and 
caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities significantly increased, while TNF-α level 
significantly decreased following ASH-WX treatment compared with control 
untreated cells. Molecular docking analysis revealed a good prediction of 
binding between cyclin D1 and Ashwagandha. There was significant accumulation of 
ASH-WX-treated HepG2cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases compared with the control 
untreated cells. Conclusion Ashwagandha could be a powerful antioxidant and a 
promising anticancer agent against HCC.
