The ability of cells to mount an interferon response to virus infections depends 
on intracellular nucleic acid sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). 
RIG-I is an intracellular PRR that binds short double-stranded viral RNAs to 
trigger MAVS-dependent signalling. The RIG-I/MAVS signalling complex requires 
the coordinated activity of multiple kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases to 
activate the transcription factors that drive type I and type III interferon 
production from infected cells. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex 
(LUBAC) regulates the activity of multiple receptor signalling pathways in both 
ligase-dependent and -independent ways. Here, we show that the three proteins 
that constitute LUBAC have separate functions in regulating RIG-I signalling. 
Both HOIP, the E3 ligase capable of generating M1-ubiquitin chains, and LUBAC 
accessory protein HOIL-1 are required for viral RNA sensing by RIG-I. The third 
LUBAC component, SHARPIN, is not required for RIG-I signalling. These data 
cement the role of LUBAC as a positive regulator of RIG-I signalling and as an 
important component of antiviral innate immune responses.
