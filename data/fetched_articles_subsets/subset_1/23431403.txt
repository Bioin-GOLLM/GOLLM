The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a critical regulator of the 
differentiation of helper and regulatory CD4+ T cells, as well as memory CD8+ T 
cells. In this study, we investigated the role of the ERK signaling pathway in 
regulating mTOR activation in T cells. We showed that activation of ERK 
following TCR engagement is required for sustained mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) 
activation. Absence of kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1), a scaffold protein of 
the ERK signaling pathway, or inhibition of ERK resulted in decreased mTORC1 
activity following T cell activation. However, KSR1-deficient mice displayed 
normal regulatory CD4+ T cell development, as well as normal memory CD8+ T cell 
responses to LCMV and Listeria monocytogenes infection. These data indicate that 
despite its role in mTORC1 activation, KSR1 is not required in vivo for 
mTOR-dependent T cell differentiation.
