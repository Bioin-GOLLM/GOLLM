Neurological complications are common in patients with COVID-19. Although severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of 
COVID-19, has been detected in some patient brains, its ability to infect brain 
cells and impact their function is not well understood. Here, we investigated 
the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived 
monolayer brain cells and region-specific brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 
infection. We found that neurons and astrocytes were sparsely infected, but 
choroid plexus epithelial cells underwent robust infection. We optimized a 
protocol to generate choroid plexus organoids from hiPSCs and showed that 
productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of these organoids is associated with increased 
cell death and transcriptional dysregulation indicative of an inflammatory 
response and cellular function deficits. Together, our findings provide evidence 
for selective SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and support the use of hiPSC-derived brain 
organoids as a platform to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility of 
brain cells, mechanisms of virus-induced brain dysfunction, and treatment 
strategies.
