Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogenous membrane-encapsulated vesicles 
secreted by every cell into the extracellular environment. EVs carry bioactive 
molecules, including proteins, lipids, DNA, and different RNA forms, which can 
be internalized by recipient cells, thus altering their biological 
characteristics. Given that EVs are commonly found in most body fluids, they 
have been widely described as mediators of communication in several 
physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Moreover, their easy 
detection in biofluids makes them potentially useful candidates as tumor 
biomarkers. In this manuscript, we review the current knowledge regarding EVs 
and non-coding RNAs and their role as drivers of the metastatic process in lung 
cancer. Furthermore, we present the most recent applications for EVs and 
non-coding RNAs as cancer therapeutics and their relevance as clinical 
biomarkers.
