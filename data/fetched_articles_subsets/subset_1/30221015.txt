BACKGROUND: Marker detection is an important task in complex disease studies. 
Here we provide an association rule mining (ARM) based approach for identifying 
integrated markers through mutual information (MI) based statistically 
significant feature extraction, and apply it to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
prostate carcinoma (PC) gene expression and methylation profiles.
METHODS: We first collect the genes having both expression and methylation 
values in AML as well as PC. Next, we run Jarque-Bera normality test on the 
expression/methylation data to divide the whole dataset into two parts: one that 
ollows normal distribution and the other that does not follow normal 
distribution. Thus, we have now four parts of the dataset: normally distributed 
expression data, normally distributed methylation data, non-normally distributed 
expression data, and non-normally distributed methylated data. A 
feature-extraction technique, "mRMR" is then utilized on each part. This results 
in a list of top-ranked genes. Next, we apply Welch t-test (parametric test) and 
Shrink t-test (non-parametric test) on the expression/methylation data for the 
top selected normally distributed genes and non-normally distributed genes, 
respectively. We then use a recent weighted ARM method, "RANWAR" to combine 
all/specific resultant genes to generate top oncogenic rules along with 
respective integrated markers. Finally, we perform literature search as well as 
KEGG pathway and Gene-Ontology (GO) analyses using Enrichr database for in 
silico validation of the prioritized oncogenes as the markers and labeling the 
markers as existing or novel.
RESULTS: The novel markers of AML are {ABCB11↑∪KRT17↓} (i.e., ABCB11 as 
up-regulated, & KRT17 as down-regulated), and {AP1S1-∪KRT17↓∪NEIL2-∪DYDC1↓}) 
(i.e., AP1S1 and NEIL2 both as hypo-methylated, & KRT17 and DYDC1 both as 
down-regulated). The novel marker of PC is {UBIAD1¶∪APBA2‡∪C4orf31‡} (i.e., 
UBIAD1 as up-regulated and hypo-methylated, & APBA2 and C4orf31 both as 
down-regulated and hyper-methylated).
CONCLUSION: The identified novel markers might have critical roles in AML as 
well as PC. The approach can be applied to other complex disease.
