BACKGROUND: The occurrence of cervical cancer is a complex process, for which 
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a risk factor, although not all women 
infected with HPV will develop the disease. Knockout of mammalian lung 
metastasis associated transcript 1 (MALAT1) is associated with increased risk 
for several cancer types, whereas the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) THRIL is 
essential for induction of tumor necrosis factor-α expression, which plays 
important roles in HPV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the effects of polymorphisms in the 
lncRNAs MALAT1 and THRIL on the susceptibility to precancerous cervical lesions, 
12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed from 164 cervical 
precancerous lesion cases and 428 controls. Gene-gene and gene-environment 
interactions and haplotype associations were also evaluated.
RESULTS: We found a significantly decreased risk of precancerous cervical 
lesions for the THRIL rs7133268 AG genotype (odds ratio adjusted = 0.63, 95% 
confidence interval: 0.42-0.94, p = 0.025). Multifactor dimensionality reduction 
analysis identified a significant two-locus interaction model involved in HPV 
infection and THRIL rs7133268 (training balanced accuracy = 0.6957, testing 
balanced accuracy = 0.6948, cross-validation consistency = 10/10, p = 0.0046). 
Other SNPs, including the two identified for MALAT1, were not significantly 
related to the risk of precancerous cervical lesions.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the rs7133268 polymorphism of the lncRNA 
THRIL gene can reduce the genetic susceptibility of precancerous cervical 
lesions and in turn reduce the risk of HPV infection.
