INTRODUCTION: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) encompasses several clinical 
and neuroimaging phenotypes, including cerebral X-ALD, the most common phenotype 
in children, and adrenomyeloneuropathy, the most common phenotype in adults. A 
spinocerebellar variant of X-ALD has been described in individuals from the Far 
East, but the criteria for its diagnosis are unclear.
CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old man from Albania was assessed because of a familial, 
slowly progressive spastic-ataxic gait associated with neurogenic bladder, 
sexual dysfunctions, and manic-like behavior. There was no definite clinical 
feature that suggested cerebellar involvement (eg, cerebellar limb ataxia, 
nystagmus, and dysarthria). A few months earlier, he had received a diagnosis of 
Addison disease. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a leukoencephalopathy 
with predominant cerebellum and brainstem involvement, and FDG-PET revealed 
marked cerebellar hypometabolism. The diagnosis of X-ALD was made because we 
found an increase of very long chain fatty acids, and a new ABCD1 mutation 
(c.1627C>T, p.Pro543Ser).
CONCLUSIONS: X-ALD should be included in the differential diagnosis of adult 
leukoencephalopathies with predominant involvement of infratentorial structures, 
that is, the cerebellum and brainstem. From a classification perspective, our 
patient (of white origin), like others (all of Asian origin), should be 
considered as suffering from a variant of adrenomyeloneuropathy rather than from 
spinocerebellar X-ALD. Actually, the term "spinocerebellar" or similar ones, 
such as "cerebello-brainstem dominant form," should be limited to those 
exceptional cases, in which both the clinical and neuroimaging findings point 
exclusively (or at least predominantly) to the involvement of infratentorial 
structures.
