A liquid chromatography⁻quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometric 
method was developed for early-stage research on adalimumab in rats. The method 
consisted of immunoprecipitation followed by tryptic digestion for sample 
preparation and LC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis of specific signature peptides of 
adalimumab in the positive ion mode using electrospray ionization. This specific 
signature peptide is derived from the complementarity-determining region (CDR) 
of adalimumab. A quadratic regression (weighted 1/concentration), with an 
equation y = ax² + bx + c, was used to fit calibration curves over the 
concentration range of 1⁻100 &mu;g/mL for adalimumab. The qualification run met 
the acceptance criteria of ±25% accuracy and precision values for quality 
control (QC) samples. This qualified LC-QTOF-MS/MS method was successfully 
applied to a pharmacokinetic study of adalimumab in rats as a case study. This 
LC-QTOF-MS/MS approach would be useful as a complementary method for adalimumab 
or its biosimilars at an early stage of research.
