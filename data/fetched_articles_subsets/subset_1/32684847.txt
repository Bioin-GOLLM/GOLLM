BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor 
in adults with a poor prognosis. DEPDC1B (DEP domain-containing protein 1B) has 
been shown to be associated with some types of malignancies. However, the role 
and underlying regulatory mechanisms of DEPDC1B in GBM remain elusive.
METHODS: In this research, the expression level of DEPDC1B in GBM tissues was 
detected by IHC. The DEPDC1B knockdown cell line was constructed, identified by 
qRT-PCR and western blot and used to construct the xenotransplantation mice 
model and intracranial xenograft model. MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow 
cytometry, and Transwell assay were used to detected cell proliferation, 
apoptosis and migration.
RESULTS: The results proved that DEPDC1B was significantly upregulated in tumor 
tissues, and silencing DEPDC1B could inhibit proliferation, migration and 
promote apoptosis of GBM cell. In addition, human apoptosis antibody array 
detection showed that after DEPDC1B knockdown, the expression of 
apoptosis-related proteins was downregulated, such as IGFBP-2, Survivin, 
N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail. Finally, we indicated that knockdown of DEPDC1B 
significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, DEPDC1B was involved in the development and progression 
of GBM, which may be a potential therapeutic target and bring a breakthrough in 
the treatment.
