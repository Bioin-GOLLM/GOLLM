Introduction: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) is a rare sex 
development disorder that results from X-linked androgen receptor gene 
mutations. Malignant transformation of the gonads is the most feared 
complication in postpubertal patients. Methods: In the current report, primary 
amenorrhea, infertility, and groin mass were symptoms described by a 58-year-old 
woman and his younger sister. Their two aunts, who shared the same clinical 
traits, passed away for an unknown reason. Results: After gonadectomy, both 
patients were diagnosed with seminoma and an extratesticular benign tumor, and 
the elder sister suffered from breast cancer about a year after the operation. 
The diagnosis of CAIS was verified by whole-exome sequencing (WES), in which an 
uncommon mutation (c.2197G>A) in the AR gene was identified. Discussion: This is 
the first family report of CAIS with germ cell tumors. The identified AR gene 
mutation based on WES can expand the understanding of CAIS.
