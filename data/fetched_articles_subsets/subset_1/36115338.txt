Reciprocal interactions between host T helper cells and gut microbiota enforce 
local immunological tolerance and modulate extra-intestinal immunity. However, 
our understanding of antigen-specific tolerance to the microbiome is limited. 
Here, we developed a systematic approach to predict HLA class-II-specific 
epitopes using the humanized bacteria-originated T cell antigen (hBOTA) 
algorithm. We identified a diverse set of microbiome epitopes spanning all major 
taxa that are compatible with presentation by multiple HLA-II alleles. In 
particular, we uncovered an immunodominant epitope from the TonB-dependent 
receptor SusC that was universally recognized and ubiquitous among 
Bacteroidales. In healthy human subjects, SusC-reactive T cell responses were 
characterized by IL-10-dominant cytokine profiles, whereas in patients with 
active Crohn's disease, responses were associated with elevated IL-17A. Our 
results highlight the potential of targeted antigen discovery within the 
microbiome to reveal principles of tolerance and functional transitions during 
inflammation.
