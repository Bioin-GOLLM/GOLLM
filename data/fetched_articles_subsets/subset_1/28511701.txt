BACKGROUND: Conditional knockout mice and transgenic mice expressing 
recombinases, reporters, and inducible transcriptional activators are key for 
many genetic studies and comprise over 90% of mouse models created. Conditional 
knockout mice are generated using labor-intensive methods of homologous 
recombination in embryonic stem cells and are available for only ~25% of all 
mouse genes. Transgenic mice generated by random genomic insertion approaches 
pose problems of unreliable expression, and thus there is a need for 
targeted-insertion models. Although CRISPR-based strategies were reported to 
create conditional and targeted-insertion alleles via one-step delivery of 
targeting components directly to zygotes, these strategies are quite 
inefficient.
RESULTS: Here we describe Easi-CRISPR (Efficient additions with ssDNA 
inserts-CRISPR), a targeting strategy in which long single-stranded DNA donors 
are injected with pre-assembled crRNA + tracrRNA + Cas9 ribonucleoprotein 
(ctRNP) complexes into mouse zygotes. We show for over a dozen loci that 
Easi-CRISPR generates correctly targeted conditional and insertion alleles in 
8.5-100% of the resulting live offspring.
CONCLUSIONS: Easi-CRISPR solves the major problem of animal genome engineering, 
namely the inefficiency of targeted DNA cassette insertion. The approach is 
robust, succeeding for all tested loci. It is versatile, generating both 
conditional and targeted insertion alleles. Finally, it is highly efficient, as 
treating an average of only 50 zygotes is sufficient to produce a correctly 
targeted allele in up to 100% of live offspring. Thus, Easi-CRISPR offers a 
comprehensive means of building large-scale Cre-LoxP animal resources.
