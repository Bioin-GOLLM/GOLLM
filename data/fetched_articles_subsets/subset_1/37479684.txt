The p53 tumor suppressor regulates multiple context-dependent tumor suppressive 
programs. Although p53 is mutated in ~90% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 
tumors, how p53 mediates tumor suppression in this context is unknown. Here, 
using a mouse model of SCLC in which endogenous p53 expression can be 
conditionally and temporally regulated, we show that SCLC tumors maintain a 
requirement for p53 inactivation. However, we identify tumor subtype 
heterogeneity between SCLC tumors such that p53 reactivation induces senescence 
in a subset of tumors, while in others, p53 induces necrosis. We pinpoint 
cyclophilins as critical determinants of a p53-induced transcriptional program 
that is specific to SCLC tumors and cell lines poised to undergo p53-mediated 
necrosis. Importantly, inhibition of cyclophilin isomerase activity, or genetic 
ablation of specific cyclophilin genes, suppresses p53-mediated necrosis by 
limiting p53 transcriptional output without impacting p53 chromatin binding. Our 
study demonstrates that intertumoral heterogeneity in SCLC influences the 
biological response to p53 restoration, describes a cyclophilin-dependent 
mechanism of p53-regulated cell death, and uncovers putative mechanisms for the 
treatment of this most-recalcitrant tumor type.
