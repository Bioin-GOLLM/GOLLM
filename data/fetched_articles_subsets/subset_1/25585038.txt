BACKGROUND: The etiology and pathogenesis of bronchial asthma remain unclear. 
This study is to investigate the risk factors related to bronchial asthma onset 
in children from genetics and immunology and preliminarily reveal the 
pathogenesis of bronchial asthma in children.
METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was adopted to detect the expression level 
of TRPV1 gene and mRNA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method to the total 
immunoglobulin E level and levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ in serum in 
peripheral venous blood for children in two groups. Logistic regression analysis 
was applied to analyze the most essential factors inducing bronchial asthma in 
children.
RESULTS: The mRNA level of TRPV1 in peripheral blood in the case group was 
higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01). The levels of IL-4, IL-5, and 
eosinophils in serum in the case group were markedly higher than those in the 
control group (P < 0.01), while IFN-γ level in the case group was lower than 
that in the control group (P < 0.01). The results of logistic regression 
analysis indicated that TRPV1 expression level, IL-4 level, and rs4790522 site 
mutation were the main risk factors inducing bronchial asthma in children.
CONCLUSION: The levels of TRPV1 gene expression and Th1/Th2 cytokines have a 
close relationship with asthma onset in children, which provides theoretical 
evidences for molecular targeted treatment in children with bronchial asthma.
