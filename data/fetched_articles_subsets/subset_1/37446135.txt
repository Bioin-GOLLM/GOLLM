The global number of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) doubles every 5 years. 
It has been established that unless an effective treatment for AD is found, the 
incidence of AD will triple by 2060. However, pharmacological therapies for AD 
have failed to show effectiveness and safety. Therefore, the search for 
alternative methods for treating AD is an urgent problem in medicine. The 
lymphatic drainage and removal system of the brain (LDRSB) plays an important 
role in resistance to the progression of AD. The development of methods for 
augmentation of the LDRSB functions may contribute to progress in AD therapy. 
Photobiomodulation (PBM) is considered to be a non-pharmacological and safe 
approach for AD therapy. Here, we highlight the most recent and relevant studies 
of PBM for AD. We focus on emerging evidence that indicates the potential 
benefits of PBM during sleep for modulation of natural activation of the LDRSB 
at nighttime, providing effective removal of metabolites, including amyloid-β, 
from the brain, leading to reduced progression of AD. Our review creates a new 
niche in the therapy of brain diseases during sleep and sheds light on the 
development of smart sleep technologies for neurodegenerative diseases.
