The BRCA2 tumour suppressor protein preserves genomic integrity via interactions 
with the DNA-strand exchange RAD51 protein in homology-directed repair. The 
RAD51-binding TR2 motif at the BRCA2 C-terminus is essential for protection and 
restart of stalled replication forks. Biochemical evidence shows that TR2 
recognises filamentous RAD51, but existing models of TR2 binding to RAD51 lack a 
structural basis. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy and structure-guided 
mutagenesis to elucidate the mechanism of TR2 binding to nucleoprotein filaments 
of human RAD51. We find that TR2 binds across the protomer interface in the 
filament, acting as a brace for adjacent RAD51 molecules. TR2 targets an 
acidic-patch motif on human RAD51 that serves as a recruitment hub in fission 
yeast Rad51 for recombination mediators Rad52 and Rad55-Rad57. Our findings 
provide a structural rationale for RAD51 filament stabilisation by BRCA2 and 
reveal a common recruitment mechanism of recombination mediators to the RAD51 
filament.
