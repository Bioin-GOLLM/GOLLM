BACKGROUND: No data are available on the immunogenicity of extremely weak D 
variants called DEL. Evaluation of alloanti-D formation in a D- female patient 
after transfusion of apparently D- blood from an Austrian donor led to discovery 
of a so far unknown DEL type.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Standard blood group serologic methods were applied. 
Molecular typing, RHD sequencing, and D epitope mapping was performed and the 
absolute D antigen density determined.
RESULTS: After transfusion of RBCs typed D- by routine serology, the recipient 
developed alloanti-D. Further evaluation with an indirect antiglobulin test 
confirmed donor RBCs to be D-. Molecular typing, however, demonstrated the 
presence of the RHD gene in one donor, and RHD sequencing revealed a deletion of 
four nucleotides in RHD intron 5 (RHD IVS5-38del4) as the only difference 
compared to the normal RHD gene. Adsorption-elution techniques demonstrated a 
DEL phenotype without apparent loss of D epitopes.
CONCLUSION: This study documents the clinical significance of the DEL phenotype 
in blood units that was capable of inducing anti-D in a recipient. Qualitative 
data are provided on D epitope expression in DEL RBCs.
