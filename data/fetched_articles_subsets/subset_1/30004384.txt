We report the near atomic resolution (3.3 Å) of the human polycystic kidney 
disease 2-like 1 (polycystin 2-l1) ion channel. Encoded by PKD2L1, polycystin 
2-l1 is a calcium and monovalent cation-permeant ion channel in primary cilia 
and plasma membranes. The related primary cilium-specific polycystin-2 protein, 
encoded by PKD2, shares a high degree of sequence similarity, yet has distinct 
permeability characteristics. Here we show that these differences are reflected 
in the architecture of polycystin 2-l1.
