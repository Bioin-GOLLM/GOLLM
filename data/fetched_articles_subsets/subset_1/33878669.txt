INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Advanced prostate cancer often presents with lower 
urinary tract symptoms together with features of cancer on digital rectal 
examination. The commonest sites of metastasis include bone, liver and lungs. 
Metastasis to axillary lymph nodes is extremely unusual particularly as initial 
presentation of the disease.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report an atypical case of a 40-year male patient 
presented with left axillary mass and normal initial urological evaluation. 
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the biopsies from the axillary mass 
and prostate confirmed the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient 
declined anti-androgen monotherapy treatment and succumbed two months after 
establishment of the diagnosis.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Prostate cancer contributes significantly to the overall 
global cancer burden. Lymphatic metastasis to axillary lymph nodes is a very 
rare manifestation of prostate cancer and only a few cases have been reported in 
the literature. Therefore, clinical diagnosis of patients presenting with 
axillary lymphadenopathy may cause diagnostic delay. Careful physical and 
imaging examinations combined with pathological analysis are essential in the 
diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer with unusual presentation.
CONCLUSION: In theory, prostate cancer can cause metastatic spread to any part 
of the body. However, metastasis to axillary nodes has not been frequently 
noticed. Our report highlights the importance of considering prostate cancer 
among differential diagnoses in Afro-Caribbean males presenting with symptoms 
suggestive of chest and abdomino-pelvic cancer.
