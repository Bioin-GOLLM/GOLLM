The causal relationship between HPV and cervical cancer in association with the 
high prevalence of high risk HPV genotypes led to the design of HPV vaccines 
based on the major capsid L1 protein. In recent years, capsid protein L2 has 
also become a focal point in the field of vaccine research. The present review 
focuses on the variability of HPV16 L1 and L2 genes, emphasizing the 
distribution of specific amino acid changes in the epitopes of capsid proteins. 
Moreover, a substantial bioinformatics analysis was conducted to describe the 
worldwide distribution of amino acid substitutions throughout HPV16 L1, L2 
proteins. Five amino acid changes (T176N, N181T; EF loop), (T266A; FG loop), 
(T353P, T389S; HI loop) are frequently observed in the L1 hypervariable surface 
loops, while two amino acid substitutions (D43E, S122P) are adjacent to L2 
specific epitopes. These changes have a high prevalence in certain geographic 
regions. The present review suggests that the extensive analysis of the amino 
acid substitutions in the HPV16 L1 immunodominant loops may provide insights 
concerning the ability of the virus in evading host immune response in certain 
populations. The genetic variability of the HPV16 L1 and L2 epitopes should be 
extensively analyzed in a given population.
