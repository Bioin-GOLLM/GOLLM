The Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently attracted major research interest as 
infection was unexpectedly associated with neurological manifestations in 
developing foetuses and with Guillain-Barré syndrome in infected adults. 
Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms requires reverse genetic 
systems, which allow manipulation of infectious cDNA clones at will. In the case 
of flaviviruses, to which ZIKV belongs, several reports have indicated that the 
construction of full-length cDNA clones is difficult due to toxicity during 
plasmid amplification in Escherichia coli. Toxicity of flaviviral cDNAs has been 
linked to the activity of cryptic prokaryotic promoters within the region 
encoding the structural proteins leading to spurious transcription and 
expression of toxic viral proteins. Here, we employ an approach based on in 
silico prediction and mutational silencing of putative promoters to generate 
full-length cDNA clones of the historical MR766 strain and the contemporary 
French Polynesian strain H/PF/2013 of ZIKV. While for both strains construction 
of full-length cDNA clones has failed in the past, we show that our approach 
generates cDNA clones that are stable on single bacterial plasmids and give rise 
to infectious viruses with properties similar to those generated by other more 
complex assembly strategies. Further, we generate luciferase and fluorescent 
reporter viruses as well as sub-genomic replicons that are fully functional and 
suitable for various research and drug screening applications. Taken together, 
this study confirms that in silico prediction and silencing of cryptic 
prokaryotic promoters is an efficient strategy to generate full-length cDNA 
clones of flaviviruses and reports novel tools that will facilitate research on 
ZIKV biology and development of antiviral strategies.
