Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are essential for regulating and 
organizing cellular microtubules (MTs). However, our mechanistic understanding 
of MAP function is limited by a lack of detailed structural information. Using 
cryo-electron microscopy and single particle algorithms, we solved the 8 Ã… 
structure of doublecortin (DCX)-stabilized MTs. Because of DCX's unusual ability 
to specifically nucleate and stabilize 13-protofilament MTs, our reconstruction 
provides unprecedented insight into the structure of MTs with an in vivo 
architecture, and in the absence of a stabilizing drug. DCX specifically 
recognizes the corner of four tubulin dimers, a binding mode ideally suited to 
stabilizing both lateral and longitudinal lattice contacts. A striking 
consequence of this is that DCX does not bind the MT seam. DCX binding on the MT 
surface indirectly stabilizes conserved tubulin-tubulin lateral contacts in the 
MT lumen, operating independently of the nucleotide bound to tubulin. DCX's 
exquisite binding selectivity uncovers important insights into regulation of 
cellular MTs.
