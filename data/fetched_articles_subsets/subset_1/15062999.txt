Mate attraction in the marine mollusk Aplysia involves long-distance waterborne 
chemical signaling via the release of the peptide pheromone attractin during egg 
laying. Aplysia californica attractin attracts conspecifics, reduces the latency 
to mating, and stimulates hermaphroditic mating. Four additional members of the 
Aplysia attractin family have recently been characterized from Aplysia 
brasiliana, Aplysia fasciata, Aplysia depilans, and Aplysia vaccaria. The five 
sequences differ significantly, but share six cysteine residues and the strictly 
conserved sequence Ile30-Glu-Glu-Cys-Lys-Thr-Ser36. Attractin is attractive to 
geographically and evolutionarily distant species, suggesting that the conserved 
heptapeptide region may be important for mate attraction. Consistent with this 
prediction, a synthetic constrained cyclic peptide that contains the conserved 
heptapeptide sequence is significantly attractive in T-maze bioassays. The 
attractins are the first family of waterborne peptide pheromones characterized 
in invertebrates and are unique in that family members are not species-specific 
pheromonal attractants.
