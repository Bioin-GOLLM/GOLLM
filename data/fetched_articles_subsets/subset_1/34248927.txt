BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is mostly 
attributed to dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (ACP) 
secondary to disease-causing variants in complement components or regulatory 
proteins. Hereditary aHUS due to C3 disruption is rare, usually caused by 
heterozygous activating mutations in the C3 gene, and transmitted as autosomal 
dominant traits. We studied the molecular basis of early-onset aHUS, associated 
with an unusual finding of a novel homozygous activating deletion in C3.
DESIGN SETTING PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: A male neonate with 
eculizumab-responsive fulminant aHUS and C3 hypocomplementemia, and six of his 
healthy close relatives were investigated. Genetic analysis on genomic DNA was 
performed by exome sequencing of the patient, followed by targeted Sanger 
sequencing for variant detection in his close relatives. Complement components 
analysis using specific immunoassays was performed on frozen plasma samples from 
the patient and mother.
RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous variant in exon 26 of C3 
(c.3322_3333del, p.Ile1108_Lys1111del), within the highly conserved 
thioester-containing domain (TED), fully segregating with the familial disease 
phenotype, as compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Complement 
profiling of the patient showed decreased C3 and FB levels, with elevated levels 
of the terminal membrane attack complex, while his healthy heterozygous mother 
showed intermediate levels of C3 consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent the first description of aHUS secondary to a 
novel homozygous deletion in C3 with ensuing unbalanced C3 over-activation, 
highlighting a critical role for the disrupted C3-TED domain in the disease 
mechanism.
