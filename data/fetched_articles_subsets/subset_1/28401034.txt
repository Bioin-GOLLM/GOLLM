Wolman disease (WD) and cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) are lysosomal 
storage diseases (LSDs) caused by a deficiency in lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) 
due to mutations in the LIPA gene. This enzyme is critical to the proper 
degradation of cholesterol in the lysosome. LAL function is completely lost in 
WD while some residual activity remains in CESD. Both are rare diseases with an 
incidence rate of less than 1/100,000 births for WD and approximate 2.5/100,000 
births for CESD. Clinical manifestation of WD includes hepatosplenomegaly, 
calcified adrenal glands, severe malabsorption and a failure to thrive. As in 
CESD, histological analysis of WD tissues reveals the accumulation of 
triglycerides (TGs) and esterified cholesterol (EC) in cellular lysosomes. 
However, the clinical presentation of CESD is less severe and more variable than 
WD. This review is to provide an overview of the disease pathophysiology and the 
current state of therapeutic development for both of WD and CESD. The review 
will also discuss the application of patient derived iPSCs for further drug 
discovery.
