Oleamide (OA) is an endogenous unsaturated fatty acid amide with demonstrated 
sleep promoting effects in rodents. The sleep enhancing actions of OA may be 
mediated through interactions with the GABAergic, serotonergic or cannabinergic 
receptor systems. In this study, we investigated the possible interaction of OA 
with the GABA(A )receptor by administering OA to mice with a targeted mutation 
of the GABAA receptor beta 3 subunit (Gabarb3-/-). Peripherally administered OA 
significantly decreased sleep latency and wake time, while it increased 
non-rapid eye movement and total sleep times in wild-type (Gabarb3+/+) mice. OA 
failed to have any sleep-wake effect in Gabarb3-/- mice. On 24 h baseline 
recordings, no differences between Gabarb3-/- and Gabarb3+/+ mice were observed, 
indicating that the lack of a pharmacological response to OA in the Gabarb3-/- 
animals was not secondary to disruptions in physiological. sleep. Therefore, one 
mechanism by which OA exerts its sleep effects may be through interactions with 
GABA(A) receptors containing the beta 3 subunit.
