We report on a 2-year-old male child with both nemaline myopathy and 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Sequencing of the ACTA1 gene showed a "de 
novo" missense heterozygous mutation a>g in exon 7 (Lys336Glu). Two-dimensional 
electrophoresis showed 28% mutant actin present in his muscle biopsy. Actin was 
isolated from the muscle biopsy and examined by in vitro motility assay. The 
sliding speed was 13+/-3% less than normal and the affinity of actin for the 
Z-line protein alpha-actinin was reduced 10 fold. This is the first report on a 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with nemaline myopathy and an ACTA1 
mutation.
