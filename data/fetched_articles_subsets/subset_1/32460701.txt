BACKGROUND: The onset of venous thromboembolism is insidious and the prognosis 
is poor. In this study, we aimed to construct a VTE risk warning model and 
testified its clinical application value.
METHODS: Preliminary construction of the VTE risk warning model was carried out 
according to the independent risk warning indicators of VTE screened by Logistic 
regression analysis. The truncated value of screening VTE was obtained and the 
model was evaluated. ROC curve analysis was used to compare the test of Caprini 
risk assessment scale and VTE risk warning model. The cut-off value of the VTE 
risk warning model was used to evaluate the test effectiveness of the model for 
VTE patients with validation data set.
RESULTS: The VTE risk warning model is p = ex / (1+ ex), x = - 4.840 + 2.557 • 
X10(1) + 1.432 • X14(1) + 2.977 • X15(1) + 3.445 • X18(1) + 1.086 • 
X25(1) + 0.249 • X34 + 0.282 • X41. ROC curve results show that: AUC (95%CI), 
cutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Youden index, Caprini risk 
assessment scale is 0.596 (0.552, 0.638), 5, 26.07, 96.50, 61.3%, 0.226, VTE 
risk warning model is 0.960 (0.940, 0.976), 0.438, 92.61, 91.83, 92.2%, 0.844, 
respectively, with statistically significant differences (Z = 14.521, 
P < 0.0001). The accuracy and Youden index of VTE screening using VTE risk 
warning model were 81.8 and 62.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: VTE risk warning model had high accuracy in predicting VTE 
occurrence in hospitalized patients. Its test performance was better than 
Caprini risk assessment scale. It also had high test performance in external 
population.
