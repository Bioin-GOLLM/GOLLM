Pyrin, a protein encoded by the MEFV gene, plays a vital role in innate immunity 
by sensing modifications in Rho GTPase and assembling the pyrin inflammasome, 
which in turn activates downstream immune responses. We identified a novel and 
de novo MEFV p.E583A dominant variant in 3 patients from the same family; the 
variant was distinct from the previously reported S242 and E244 sites. These 
patients exhibited a phenotype that diverged from those resulting from classical 
MEFV gene mutations, characterized by the absence of recurrent fever but the 
presence of recurrent chest and abdominal pain. Colchicine effectively 
controlled the phenotype, and the mutation was found to induce pyrin 
inflammasome assembly and activation in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) and cell lines. Mechanistically, truncation experiments revealed 
that the E583A variant affected the autoinhibitory structure of pyrin. Our study 
offers insights into the mechanisms underlying pyrin inflammasome activation.
