Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare heterogenous condition that causes 
progressive suppurative lung disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic otitis 
media, infertility and abnormal situs. 'Better Experimental Approaches to Treat 
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia' (BEAT-PCD) is a network of scientists and clinicians 
coordinating research from basic science through to clinical care with the 
intention of developing treatments and diagnostics that lead to improved 
long-term outcomes for patients. BEAT-PCD activities are supported by EU funded 
COST Action (BM1407). The second BEAT-PCD conference, and third PCD training 
school were held jointly in April 2017 in Valencia, Spain. Presentations and 
workshops focussed on advancing the knowledge and skills relating to PCD in: 
basic science, epidemiology, diagnostic testing, clinical management and 
clinical trials. The multidisciplinary conference provided an interactive 
platform for exchanging ideas through a program of lectures, poster 
presentations, breakout sessions and workshops. Three working groups met to plan 
consensus statements. Progress with BEAT-PCD projects was shared and new 
collaborations were fostered. In this report, we summarize the meeting, 
highlighting developments made during the meeting.
