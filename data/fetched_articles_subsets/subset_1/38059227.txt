OBJECTIVES: Risk prediction scores are important for early diagnosis and 
treatment of diseases. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common 
complication of type 2 diabetes, but the early diagnosis is challenging. This 
study developed a risk prediction model for DPN based on modifiable risk 
factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 315 type 2 diabetes patients with and 
without DPN. Demographic, biochemical, and diagnostic data were collected. 
Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk 
factors for DPN.
RESULTS: Hemoglobin% and total red blood cells were identified as independent 
risk factors for DPN, used to develop a risk prediction score.
CONCLUSION: The risk prediction score developed in this study can be used by 
physicians to quickly assess a patient's risk of DPN and select appropriate 
therapeutic options. Routine monitoring of modifiable risk factors can improve 
DPN prognosis. Patients stratified by risk scores can better understand their 
risk and seek appropriate care.
