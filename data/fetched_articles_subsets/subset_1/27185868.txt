OBJECTIVE: Although pituitary adenomas (PAs) affect a significant proportion of 
the population, only a fraction have the potential to become clinically relevant 
during an individual's lifetime, causing hormonal imbalance or complications due 
to mass effect. The overwhelming majority of cases are sporadic and without a 
clear familial history, and the genotype-phenotype correlation in PA patients is 
poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate the involvement of genes known for 
their role in familial cases on drug response and tumor suppression in the 
development and pathology of PAs in a patient group from Latvia.
DESIGN: The study included 143 cases and 354 controls, we investigated the role 
of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes (SSTR2, SSTR5, DRD2, 
MEN1, AIP, GNAS, and PRKAR1A) associated with pituitary tumor occurrence, 
phenotype, and clinical symptoms.
METHODS: Genotyping of 96 tag and nonsynonymous SNPs was performed in the 
genomic regions of interest.
RESULTS: We discovered a significant association (OR=17.8, CI 0.95=2.18-145.5, 
P=0.0002) between a rare MEN1 mutation (rs2959656) and clinically active adenoma 
in our patients. Additionally, rs7131056 at DRD2 was associated with a higher 
occurrence of extrasellar growth in patients with prolactinoma and 
somatotropinoma (OR=2.79, CI 0.95=1.58-4.95, P=0.0004).
CONCLUSIONS: rs2959656, a nonsynonymous variant in MEN1, is associated with the 
development of clinically active PA. Furthermore, rs7131056 in DRD2 contributes 
to either faster growth of the adenoma or reduced symptomatic presentation, 
allowing PAs to become larger before detection.
