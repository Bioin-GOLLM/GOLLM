Abnormal synaptic formation and signaling is one of the key molecular features 
of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Cortactin binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2), an 
ASD-linked gene, is known to regulate the subcellular distribution of synaptic 
proteins, such as cortactin, thereby controlling dendritic spine formation and 
maintenance. However, it remains unclear how ASD-linked mutations of CTTNBP2 
influence its function. Here, using cultured hippocampal neurons and knockin 
mouse models, we screen seven ASD-linked mutations in the short form of the 
Cttnbp2 gene and identify that M120I, R533* and D570Y mutations impair CTTNBP2 
protein-protein interactions via divergent mechanisms to reduce dendritic spine 
density in neurons. R533* mutation impairs CTTNBP2 interaction with cortactin 
due to lack of the C-terminal proline-rich domain. Through an N-C terminal 
interaction, M120I mutation at the N-terminal region of CTTNBP2 also negatively 
influences cortactin interaction. D570Y mutation increases the association of 
CTTNBP2 with microtubule, resulting in a dendritic localization of CTTNBP2, 
consequently reducing the distribution of CTTNBP2 in dendritic spines and 
impairing the synaptic function of CTTNBP2. Finally, we generated heterozygous 
M120I knockin mice to mimic the genetic variation of patients and found they 
exhibit reduced social interaction. Our study elucidates that different 
ASD-linked mutations of CTTNBP2 result in diverse molecular deficits, but all 
have the similar consequence of synaptic impairment.
