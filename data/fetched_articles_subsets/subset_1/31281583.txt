Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a disease that impacts cellular 
homeostasis. CVI may occur with a valvular destruction process known as venous 
reflux or valvular incompetence. One of the cellular processes that may be 
triggered as a consequence of these events is the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS), which may trigger the production of different cellular markers 
and cell damage processes, such as lipid peroxidation. Therefore, the present 
study performed an observational, analytical, and prospective cohort study by 
reviewing 110 patients with CVI, and the activities and plasma levels of iNOS, 
eNOS, NOX1, and NOX2 were determined using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. 
Lipid peroxidation (MDA) was also measured. Patients were distributed according 
to the presence or absence of valvular incompetence-venous reflux, which was 
diagnosed clinically as the absence of venous reflux (NR = 29) or presence of 
venous reflux (R = 81). Each group was divided according to age, with a cutoff 
point of fifty years (NR < 50 = 13, NR ≥ 50 = 16, R < 50 = 32, and R ≥ 50 = 49). 
The results showed that R patients exhibited significantly increased plasma MDA 
levels, and R < 50 patients exhibited the highest statistically significant 
increase. iNOS, NOX1, and NOX2 exhibited the highest gene and protein expression 
in R patients. The increased expression was maintained in the R < 50 patients. 
Our data suggest that young patients with valvular incompetence (venous reflux) 
show higher levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, which reflects 
the characteristics of an aged patient.
