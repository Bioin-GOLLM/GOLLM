Mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene is regarded a novel 
indicator for the prognosis of patients with glioma. However, the role of the 
IDH1 gene mutations in carcinogenesis and the mechanisms underlying their 
function in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remain unknown. The present study 
aimed to determine whether the association of RLIP76 with the different IDH1 
mutational status could serve as a putative biomarker for improving disease 
prognosis. Quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemical staining 
assays were used to investigate the expression levels of RLIP76 in 124 patients 
with GBM with different IDH1 mutational status. In addition, the association 
between RLIP76 expression, IDH1 mutational status and clinicopathological 
characteristics was investigated. The effects of RLIP76 expression and IDH1 
mutational status on cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and cell signaling were 
examined by Cell Counting Kit‑8, flow cytometry and western blot assays, 
respectively. The data demonstrated that IDH1 wild‑type (IDH1Wt) patients with 
low RLIP76 expression exhibited improved overall and progression‑free survival. 
This effect was not observed in patients with IDH1 mutant (IDH1Mut) GBM. 
In vitro assays demonstrated that knockdown of IDH1 or overexpression of the 
IDH1 R132H mutation suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in 
U87 glioma cells. Mechanistic studies further indicated that although the IDH1 
R132H mutant phenotype exhibited similar antitumor effects on GBM cells as those 
observed with the IDH1 knockdown, it acted via a different mechanism with regard 
to the regulation of the apoptosis signaling pathway. IDH1 R132H mutant cells 
promoted p53‑induced apoptosis, while the IDH1 knockdown inhibited the 
RLIP76‑dependent apoptotic pathway in glioma cells. The findings of the present 
study provided insight to the contribution of IDH1 mutation in the development 
of GBM and indicated that RLIP76 may be considered as a prognostic biomarker of 
IDH1Wt GBM.
