In order to directly detect nucleic acid polymers, we have designed biosensors 
comprising sequence-specific DNA binding proteins tethered to split-reporter 
proteins, which generate signal upon binding a predetermined nucleic acid 
target, in an approach termed SEquence-Enabled Reassembly (SEER). Herein we 
demonstrate that spectroscopically distinct split-fluorescent protein variants, 
GFPuv, EGFP, Venus, and mCherry, function effectively in the SEER system, 
providing sensitive DNA detection and the ability to simultaneously detect two 
target oligonucleotides. Additionally, a methylation-specific SEER-Venus system 
was generated, which was found to clearly distinguish between methylated versus 
non-methylated target DNA. These results will aid in refinement of the SEER 
system for the detection of user defined nucleic acid sequences and their 
chemical modifications as they relate to human disease.
