Pathogenic tau accumulation fuels neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Enhancing aging brain's resilience to tau pathology would lead to novel 
therapeutic strategies. DAP12 (DNAX-activation protein 12) is critically 
involved in microglial immune responses. Previous studies have showed that mice 
lacking DAP12 in tauopathy mice exhibit higher tau pathology but are protected 
from tau-induced cognitive deficits. However, the exact mechanism remains 
elusive. Our current study uncovers a novel resilience mechanism via microglial 
interaction with oligodendrocytes. Despite higher tau inclusions, Dap12 deletion 
curbs tau-induced brain inflammation and ameliorates myelin and synapse loss. 
Specifically, removal of Dap12 abolished tau-induced disease-associated clusters 
in microglia (MG) and intermediate oligodendrocytes (iOli), which are spatially 
correlated with tau pathology in AD brains. Our study highlights the critical 
role of interactions between microglia and oligodendrocytes in tau toxicity and 
DAP12 signaling as a promising target for enhancing resilience in AD.
