BACKGROUND: Non-inflamed tumors, including immune-excluded and immune-desert 
tumors, are commonly resistant to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (α-PD-1/PD-L1) therapy. Our 
previous study reported the potent antitumor activity of anti-TGF-β/PD-L1 
bispecific antibody YM101 in immune-excluded tumors. However, YM101 had limited 
antitumor activity in immune-desert models. MSA-2 is a novel oral stimulator of 
interferon genes (STING) agonist, which activates the innate immune system and 
may synergize with YM101 in overcoming immunotherapy resistance.
METHODS: The dose-dependent effect of MSA-2 on STING signaling was determined by 
interferon-β level. The maturation and function of dendritic cell (DC) were 
measured by flow cytometry, RNA-seq, one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), 
OVA peptide pulse, and cytokine/chemokine detection. The synergistic effect 
between MSA-2 and YM101 was assessed by one-way MLR. The macrophage activation 
was measured by flow cytometry and cytokine/chemokine detection. The in vivo 
antitumor activity of MSA-2 combined with YM101 was explored in syngeneic murine 
tumor models. After treatments, the alterations in the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) were detected by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining, 
immunofluorescence staining, RNA-seq, and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq).
RESULTS: MSA-2 could promote the maturation and antigen presentation capability 
of murine DC. In the one-way MLR assay, MSA-2 synergized with YM101 in enhancing 
naive T cell activation. Moreover, MSA-2 stimulated the classical activation of 
macrophage, without significant influence on alternative activation. Further in 
vivo explorations showed that MSA-2 increased multiple proinflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines in the TME. MSA-2 combined with YM101 remarkedly retarded tumor 
growth in immune-excluded and immune-desert models, with superior antitumor 
activity to monotherapies. Flow cytometry, bulk RNA-seq, and scRNA-seq assays 
indicated that the combination therapy simultaneously boosted the innate and 
adaptive immunity, promoted antigen presentation, improved T cell migration and 
chemotaxis, and upregulated the numbers and activities of tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that MSA-2 synergizes with YM101 in boosting 
antitumor immunity. This immune cocktail therapy effectively overcomes 
immunotherapy resistance in immune-excluded and immune-desert models.
