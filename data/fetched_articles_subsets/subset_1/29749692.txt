Alpha thalassemia due to nondeletional mutations usually leads to more severe 
disease than that caused by deletional mutations. Devastating outcomes such as 
hydrops fetalis can occur with two nondeletional mutations, therefore warranting 
DNA-based workup for suspected carriers with subtle hematological abnormalities 
for family counseling purposes. We describe three cases with hemoglobin (Hb) 
Adana, a nondeletional alpha chain mutation, compounded with an alpha globin 
gene deletion resulting in thalassemia intermedia. We review the literature, 
draw genotype-phenotype correlations from published cases of Hb Adana, and 
propose that this correlation can be used by clinicians to help direct 
diagnostic studies and urge hematologists to thoroughly workup high-risk 
patients.
