BACKGROUND: The recently discovered small-molecule BI-2 potently blocks HIV-1 
infection. BI-2 binds to the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 capsid. BI-2 utilizes 
the same capsid pocket used by the small molecule PF74. Although both drugs bind 
to the same pocket, it has been proposed that BI-2 uses a different mechanism to 
block HIV-1 infection when compared to PF74.
FINDINGS: This work demonstrates that BI-2 destabilizes the HIV-1 core during 
infection, and prevents the binding of the cellular factor CPSF6 to the HIV-1 
core.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall this short-form paper suggests that BI-2 is using a similar 
mechanism to the one used by PF74 to block HIV-1 infection.
