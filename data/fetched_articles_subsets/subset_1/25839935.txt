AIMS: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a multifactorial disease caused by a combination 
of environmental risk factors and genetic susceptibilities. However, few studies 
have assessed the effects of gene-gene interactions among cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
pathway genes on the risk of stroke. The present study investigated the 
association of seven variants of six CYP pathway genes with IS in a Chinese 
population.
MAIN METHODS: A total of 396 patients with IS and 378 controls were genotyped 
for seven variants from six CYP pathway genes, including CYP2J2 rs10889160, 
CYP2C8 rs17110453, CYP2C8 rs1934980, CYP2C9 rs1799853, CYP2C9 rs1057910, and 
CYP3A5 rs776746, as well as epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2) rs751141, using 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) methods. Gene-gene interactions were analyzed using generalized 
multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) methods.
KEY FINDINGS: Single-gene variant analysis showed no significant differences in 
the genotype distributions of the seven variants between IS patients and healthy 
volunteers. However, GMDR analysis showed a significant gene-gene interaction 
between rs17110453 and rs751141, with scores of 10 and 9 for the 
cross-validation consistency and sign test, respectively (P=0.0167). A 1.86-fold 
increased risk for IS was detected in individuals carrying the genotypes of 
rs17110453CC and rs751141GG (adjusted for age, hypertension, and diabetes 
mellitus; 95% CI: 1.216-2.896, P=0.005).
SIGNIFICANCE: The CYP2C8 rs17110453 and EPHX2 rs751141 two-locus interaction 
confers a significantly higher risk for IS. The combinational analysis used in 
this study may be helpful in the elucidation of genetic risk factors for common 
and complex diseases such as IS.
