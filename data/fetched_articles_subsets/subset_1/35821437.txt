PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between treatment efficacy and exposure of 
total and unbound erlotinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor naïve NSCLC patients were 
enrolled, and erlotinib was started at 150 mg/day. Total and unbound exposure of 
erlotinib were prospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 70 enrolled patients, 61 had EGFR-activating mutations (30 
patients with exon 19 deletions, 31 patients with L858R). The median area under 
the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) of total and unbound 
erlotinib on day 1 was 37,004 ng·h/mL (range, 9683-63,257 ng·h/mL) and 
2338 ng·h/mL (581-5904 ng·h/mL), respectively. The median progression-free 
survival (PFS) was 10.9 months, and PFS did not differ between each tertile of 
total and unbound AUC0-24 on day 1 in 59 patients with EGFR-activating 
mutations. The worst grade of skin toxicities was significantly correlated with 
total trough concentration at steady state (Ctrough,ss) at each visit for 
3 months after the initiation of erlotinib treatment (P < 0.0001). Total and 
unbound Ctrough,ss on day 7-15 in 20 patients whose dose was reduced due to 
intolerable toxicities was significantly higher than those in 48 patients whose 
dose was unchanged for 3 months (P = 0.0046, 0.0008).
CONCLUSION: The lack of relationship between efficacy and exposure of total and 
unbound erlotinib demonstrates that the standard dose of 150 mg/day is 
sufficient for the treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations, 
despite wide inter-individual variability in exposure and dose reduction.
