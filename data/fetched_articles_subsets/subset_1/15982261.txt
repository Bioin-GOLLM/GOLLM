In this article, we report the identification of a new human leukocyte antigen-B 
allele in a sample that was tested in our routine typing for volunteer bone 
marrow donors. This novel allele officially designed B*5517 was found in a male 
donor of Bavarian Caucasoid origin (Laboratory code 150113). The search for 
unrelated bone marrow donors was initiated by the Aktion Knochenmarkspende 
Bayern. In comparison with the common B*5501 allele, B*5517 differs at three 
nucleotide positions all located in exon 3, at position 379 (C-->G), 419 
(T-->A), and 420 (A-->C), resulting in two amino acid substitutions at codons 
127 and 140. The amino acid 127, leucine, is changed to valine, and the amino 
acid 140, also a leucine, is replaced by tyrosine in B*5517.
