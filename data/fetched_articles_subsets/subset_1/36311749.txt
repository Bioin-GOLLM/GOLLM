Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic condition that commonly influences the 
spine and sacroiliac joints, usually progresses to stiffness and progressive 
functional limitation. Its fundamental etiology and pathogenesis are likely 
multifactorial and remain elusive. As environmental factors, gut microbiota 
performs critical functions in the pathogenesis of AS through various 
mechanisms, including interacting with genes, enhancing intestinal permeability, 
activating the gut mucosa immune system, and affecting the intestinal microbiota 
metabolites. This review provides an overview of recent advances in 
investigating gut microbiota in AS pathogenesis and discusses potential methods 
for future therapeutic intervention.
