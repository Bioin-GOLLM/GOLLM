Systemic lupus erythematosus is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by 
autoantibody production and immune complex formation/deposition in target organs 
such as the kidney. Resultant local inflammation then leads to organ damage. 
Nephritis, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with lupus, 
occurs in approximately 50% of lupus patients. In the present review, we provide 
an overview of the current research and knowledge concerning mechanisms of renal 
injury in both lupus-prone mouse models and human lupus patients.
