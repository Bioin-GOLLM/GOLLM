The use of blood plasma biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC) management is limited 
due to a lack of reliable biomarkers. An LC-MS/MS assay and a bioinformatic 
analysis were performed to identify blood plasma biomarkers in a GC discovery 
cohort. The data obtained were verified and validated by western blotting and an 
ELISA in an independent study cohort. A label-free quantification analysis of 
the MS data using PEAKS7 software found that four plasma proteins of 
apolipoprotein C-1, gelsolin, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and 
complement component C4-A were significantly overexpressed in GC patients. A 
western blot assay of these plasma proteins showed that only SHBG was 
consistently overexpressed in the patient group. ELISA measurement of SHBG blood 
plasma levels confirmed that the patient group had significantly higher SHBG 
levels than the control group. SHBG levels in the patient group remained 
significantly higher after being stratified by gender, age, and disease stage. 
These findings show that LC-MS/MS is powerful and highly sensitive for plasma 
biomarker discovery, and SHBG could be a potential plasma biomarker for GC 
management.
