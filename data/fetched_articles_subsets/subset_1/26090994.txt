The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 consists of 10 exons and encodes a zinc finger 
transcription factor. There are four major WT1 isoforms resulting from 
alternative splicing at two sites, exon 5 (17AA) and exon 9 (KTS). All major WT1 
isoforms are overexpressed in leukemia and solid tumors and play oncogenic roles 
such as inhibition of apoptosis, and promotion of cell proliferation, migration 
and invasion. In the present study, a novel alternatively spliced WT1 isoform 
that had an extended exon 4 (designated as exon 4a) with an additional 153 bp 
(designated as 4a sequence) at the 3' end was identified and designated as an 
Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform. The insertion of exon 4a resulted in the introduction of 
premature translational stop codons in the reading frame in exon 4a and 
production of C-terminal truncated WT1 proteins lacking zinc finger DNA-binding 
domain. Overexpression of the truncated Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform inhibited the major 
WT1-mediated transcriptional activation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL gene promoter 
and induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Conversely, suppression of the 
Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform by Ex4a-specific siRNA attenuated apoptosis. These results 
indicated that the Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform exerted dominant negative effects on 
anti-apoptotic function of major WT1 isoforms. Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform was 
endogenously expressed as a minor isoform in myeloid leukemia and solid tumor 
cells and increased regardless of decrease in major WT1 isoforms during 
apoptosis, suggesting the dominant negative effects on anti-apoptotic function 
of major WT1 isoforms. These results indicated that Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform had an 
important physiological function that regulated oncogenic function of major WT1 
isoforms.
