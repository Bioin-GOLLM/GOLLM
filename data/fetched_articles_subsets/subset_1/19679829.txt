OBJECTIVE: Leukocyte recruitment is a major contributor in the development of 
atherosclerosis and requires a variety of proteins such as adhesion molecules, 
chemokines, and chemokine receptors. Several key molecular players implicated in 
this process are expressed on monocytes and require protein-tyrosine sulfation 
for optimal function in vitro, including human CCR2, CCR5, CX3CR1, and PSGL-1. 
We therefore hypothesized that protein-tyrosine sulfation in hematopoietic cells 
plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Lethally-irradiated Ldlr(-/-) mice were rescued with 
hematopoietic progenitors lacking tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST) 
activity attributable to deletion of the Tpst1 and Tpst2 genes. TPST deficient 
progenitors efficiently reconstituted hematopoiesis in Ldlr(-/-) recipients and 
transplantation had no effect on plasma lipids on a standard or atherogenic 
diet. However, we observed a substantial reduction in the size of 
atherosclerotic lesions and the number of macrophages in lesions from 
hyperlipidemic Ldlr(-/-) recipients transplanted with TPST deficient progenitors 
compared to wild-type progenitors. We also document for the first time that 
murine Psgl-1 and Cx3cr1 are tyrosine-sulfated.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that protein-tyrosine sulfation is an 
important contributor to monocytes/macrophage recruitment and/or retention in a 
mouse model of atherosclerosis.
