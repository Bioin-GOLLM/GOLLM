BACKGROUND: Tube size selection is critical in ventilating patients' lungs using 
double-lumen endobronchial tubes (DLTs). Little information about relevant 
parameters is readily available from manufacturers. The aim of this study is to 
provide reference data for relevant dimensions of conventionally available DLTs.
METHODS: In this study in a benchmark in vitro setup, several dimensional 
parameters of four sizes of left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tubes from six 
different manufacturers were assessed, such as distances and diameters of tube 
shaft, cuff lengths, and diameters as well the angle at the tip.
RESULTS: Endobronchial tubes of ostensibly the same size revealed wide variation 
in measured parameters between brands from different manufacturers. In some 
parameters, there was an overlap between different sizes from the same 
manufacturer, i.e., diameters and distances did not increase with increasing 
nominal endobronchial tube size. The information about dimensions of 
endobronchial tubes provided by manufacturers' leaflets is insufficient.
CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial tube size selection carries unnecessary uncertainty 
because clinically relevant parameters are unknown and vary considerably between 
different manufacturers.
