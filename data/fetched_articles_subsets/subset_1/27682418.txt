A simple technique for suppressor detection in Escherichia coli.

Vinué L, Hooper DC.

To study the viability of a gyrA S83 stop mutation found in an Escherichia coli 
J53 ciprofloxacin-resistant strain (J53 CipR27), a pBR322 derivative was 
constructed with a TAG mutation in the bla gene knocking out ampicillin 
resistance. Ampicillin resistance was restored, suggesting that the strain 
contains tRNA suppressor activity able to suppress the UAG codon gyrA and allow 
viability. The method was applied to 22 unique clinical E. coli isolates, and 
all were found to have low-level suppressor activity.
