Lung disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Innate 
immune responses in the lung play a central role in the pathogenesis of lung 
disease and the maintenance of lung health, and thus it is crucial to understand 
factors that regulate them. Hyaluronan is ubiquitous in the lung, and its 
expression is increased following lung injury and in disease states. 
Furthermore, hyaladherins like inter-α-inhibitor, tumor necrosis 
factor-stimulated gene 6, pentraxin 3 and versican are also induced and help 
form a dynamic hyaluronan matrix in injured lung. This review synthesizes 
present knowledge about the interactions of hyaluronan and its associated 
hyaladherins with the lung immune system, and the implications of these 
interactions for lung biology and disease.
