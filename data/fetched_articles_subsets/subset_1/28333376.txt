The heart is uniquely responsible for providing its own blood supply through the 
coronary circulation. Regulation of coronary blood flow is quite complex and, 
after over 100 years of dedicated research, is understood to be dictated through 
multiple mechanisms that include extravascular compressive forces (tissue 
pressure), coronary perfusion pressure, myogenic, local metabolic, endothelial 
as well as neural and hormonal influences. While each of these determinants can 
have profound influence over myocardial perfusion, largely through effects on 
end-effector ion channels, these mechanisms collectively modulate coronary 
vascular resistance and act to ensure that the myocardial requirements for 
oxygen and substrates are adequately provided by the coronary circulation. The 
purpose of this series of Comprehensive Physiology is to highlight current 
knowledge regarding the physiologic regulation of coronary blood flow, with 
emphasis on functional anatomy and the interplay between the physical and 
biological determinants of myocardial oxygen delivery. © 2017 American
