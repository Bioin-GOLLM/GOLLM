Successful vaccine development for infectious diseases has largely been achieved 
in settings where natural immunity to the pathogen results in clearance in at 
least some individuals. HIV presents an additional challenge in that natural 
clearance of infection does not occur, and the correlates of immune protection 
are still uncertain. However, partial control of viremia and markedly different 
outcomes of disease are observed in HIV-infected persons. Here, we examine the 
antiviral mechanisms implicated by one variable that has been consistently 
associated with extremes of outcome, namely HLA class I alleles, and in 
particular HLA-B, and examine the mechanisms by which this modulation is likely 
to occur and the impact of these interactions on evolution of the virus and the 
host. Studies to date provide evidence for both HLA-dependent and 
epitope-dependent influences on viral control and viral evolution and have 
important implications for the continued quest for an effective HIV vaccine.
