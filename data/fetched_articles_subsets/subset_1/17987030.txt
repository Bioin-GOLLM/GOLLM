Post-translational protein modifications are integral components of signalling 
cascades that enable cells to efficiently, rapidly and reversibly respond to 
extracellular stimuli. These modifications have crucial roles in the CNS, where 
the communication between neurons is particularly complex. SUMOylation is a 
post-translational modification in which a member of the small ubiquitin-like 
modifier (SUMO) family of proteins is conjugated to lysine residues in target 
proteins. It is well established that SUMOylation controls many aspects of 
nuclear function, but it is now clear that it is also a key determinant in many 
extranuclear neuronal processes, and it has also been implicated in a wide range 
of neuropathological conditions.
