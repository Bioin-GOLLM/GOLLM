Regenerating periodontal bone tissues in the aggravated inflammatory periodontal 
microenvironment under diabetic conditions is a great challenge. Here, a 
polydopamine-mediated graphene oxide (PGO) and hydroxyapatite nanoparticle 
(PHA)-incorporated conductive alginate/gelatin (AG) scaffold is developed to 
accelerate periodontal bone regeneration by modulating the diabetic inflammatory 
microenvironment. PHA confers the scaffold with osteoinductivity and PGO 
provides a conductive pathway for the scaffold. The conductive scaffold promotes 
bone regeneration by transferring endogenous electrical signals to cells and 
activating Ca2+ channels. Moreover, the scaffold with polydopamine-mediated 
nanomaterials has a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability and 
anti-inflammatory activity. It also exhibits an immunomodulatory ability that 
suppresses M1 macrophage polarization and activates M2 macrophages to secrete 
osteogenesis-related cytokines by mediating glycolytic and RhoA/ROCK pathways in 
macrophages. The scaffold induces excellent bone regeneration in periodontal 
bone defects of diabetic rats because of the synergistic effects of good 
conductive, ROS-scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory abilities. 
This study provides fundamental insights into the synergistical effects of 
conductivity, osteoinductivity, and immunomodulatory abilities on bone 
regeneration and offers a novel strategy to design immunomodulatory biomaterials 
for treatment of immune-related diseases and tissue regeneration.
