BACKGROUND: B-vitamins are essential for one-carbon metabolism and have been 
linked to colorectal cancer. Although associations with folate have frequently 
been studied, studies on other plasma vitamins B2, B6, and B12 and colorectal 
cancer are scarce or inconclusive.
METHODS: We carried out a nested case-control study within the European 
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, including 1,365 incident 
colorectal cancer cases and 2,319 controls matched for study center, age, and 
sex. We measured the sum of B2 species riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide, and 
the sum of B6 species pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal, and 4-pyridoxic acid as 
indicators for vitamin B2 and B6 status, as well as vitamin B12 in plasma 
samples collected at baseline. In addition, we determined eight polymorphisms 
related to one-carbon metabolism. Relative risks for colorectal cancer were 
estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for smoking, 
education, physical activity, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and intakes 
of fiber and red and processed meat.
RESULTS: The relative risks comparing highest to lowest quintile were 0.71 [95% 
confidence interval (95% CI), 0.56-0.91; P(trend) = 0.02] for vitamin B2, 0.68 
(95% CI, 0.53-0.87; P(trend) <0.001) for vitamin B6, and 1.02 (95% CI, 
0.80-1.29; P(trend) = 0.19) for vitamin B12. The associations for vitamin B6 
were stronger in males who consumed ≥30 g alcohol/day. The polymorphisms were 
not associated with colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma concentrations of vitamins B2 and B6 are associated 
with a lower colorectal cancer risk.
IMPACT: This European population-based study is the first to indicate that 
vitamin B2 is inversely associated with colorectal cancer, and is in agreement 
with previously suggested inverse associations of vitamin B6 with colorectal 
cancer.
