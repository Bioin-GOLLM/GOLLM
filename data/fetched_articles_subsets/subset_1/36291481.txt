Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with a 
broad and variable phenotypic spectrum characterized by intellectual disability, 
prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, hypertrichosis, characteristic facial 
features, behavioral problems, and congenital anomalies involving different 
systems. Here, we report a five-year-old boy who was diagnosed with WDSTS based 
on the results of Trio-based whole-exome sequencing and an assessment of his 
clinical features. He had intellectual disability, short stature, hirsutism, and 
atypical facial features, including a low hairline, down-slanting palpebral 
fissures, hypertelorism, long eyelashes, broad and arching eyebrows, synophrys, 
a bulbous nose, a broad nasal tip, and dental/oral anomalies. However, not all 
individuals with WDSTS exhibit the classic phenotype, so the spectrum of the 
disorder can vary widely from relatively atypical facial features to multiple 
systemic symptoms. Here, we summarize the clinical and molecular spectrum, 
diagnosis and differential diagnosis, long-term management, and care planning of 
WDSTS to improve the awareness of both pediatricians and clinical geneticists 
and to promote the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
