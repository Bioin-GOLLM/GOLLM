The best global seller among oncology drugs in 2018 is lenalidomide, an analog 
of thalidomide. It took 53 years and a circuitous route from the discovery of 
thalidomide to approval of an analog for use in treatment of cancer. We 
understand now a lot more about the genetic and molecular basis of diseases than 
we did in 1953 when thalidomide was discovered. We have also no shortage of 
chemical libraries with hundreds of thousands of compounds, both synthetic and 
natural. What we need are better ways to search among these rich resources for 
compounds with the potential to do what we want them to do. This review 
summarizes examples from the literature that make Drosophila melanogaster a good 
model to screen for drugs, and discusses knowledge gaps and technical challenges 
that make Drosophila models not as widely used as they could or should be. This 
article is categorized under: Technologies > Analysis of Cell, Tissue, and 
Animal Phenotypes.
