Bacterial blight caused by the infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) 
is a devastating disease that severely challenges the yield of rice. Here, we 
report the identification of a "SAPK10-WRKY72-AOS1" module, through which Xoo 
infection stimulates the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to cause 
Xoo susceptibility. WRKY72 directly binds to the W-box in the promoter of JA 
biosynthesis gene AOS1 and represses its transcription by inducing DNA 
hypermethylation on the target site, which finally led to lower endogenous JA 
level and higher Xoo susceptibility. Abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible SnRK2-type 
kinase SAPK10 phosphorylates WRKY72 at Thr 129. The SAPK10-mediated 
phosphorylation impairs the DNA-binding ability of WRKY72 and releases its 
suppression on AOS1 and JA biosynthesis. Our work highlights a module of how 
pathogen stimuli lead to plant susceptibility, as well as a potential pathway 
for ABA-JA interplay with post-translational modification and epigenetic 
regulation mechanism involved.
