Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases, including 
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is well known 
for its restricted tropism and it does not replicate well in animal species 
other than humans and chimpanzees. Since classical in vitro propagation of 
natural HCV isolates is not possible, a protocol for the rescue of infectious 
virus from cDNA clones (genotype 1a pH77S and genotype 2a pJFH-1) transfected as 
RNA into permissive cells is described here. Because these two molecular clones 
behave differently in their ability to propagate and produce infectious virus, 
different methods for propagation of these two viral strains are described. 
Methods for infectious virus titration, which can be accomplished by counting 
foci of infected cells following immunostaining for viral antigen expression in 
cells infected with serial dilutions of a virus harvest (focus forming unit, or 
FFU, assay), are also provided.
