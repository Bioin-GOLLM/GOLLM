Immune inflammation is crucial in mediating acute kidney injury (AKI). Immune 
cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems substantially contribute to 
overall renal damage in AKI. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key regulator of 
immunological function and have been demonstrated to ameliorate injury in 
several murine experimental models of renal inflammation. Recent studies have 
illuminated the renal-protective function of Tregs in AKI. Tregs appear to exert 
beneficial effects in both the acute injury phase and the recovery phase of AKI. 
Additionally, Tregs-based immunotherapy may represent a promising approach to 
ameliorate AKI and promote recovery from AKI. This review will highlight the 
recent insights into the role of Tregs and their therapeutic potential in AKI.
