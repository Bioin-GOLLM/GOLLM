Chronic rejection of transplanted organs remains the main obstacle in the 
long-term success of organ transplantation. Thus, there is a persistent quest 
for development of antichronic rejection therapies and identification of novel 
molecular and cellular targets. One of the potential targets is the pericytes, 
the mural cells of microvessels, which regulate microvascular permeability, 
development, and maturation by controlling endothelial cell functions and 
regulating tissue fibrosis and inflammatory response. In this review, we discuss 
the potential of targeting pericytes in the development of microvasular 
dysfunction and the molecular pathways involved in regulation of pericyte 
activities for antichronic rejection intervention.
