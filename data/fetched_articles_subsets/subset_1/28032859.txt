Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressors contributes to the development and 
progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We recently found that speckle-type POZ 
protein (SPOP) was significantly downregulated and the inactivation of SPOP 
promoted metastasis in CRC. This study aimed to clarify its epigenetic 
alteration, molecular mechanisms and clinical significance in CRC. Our results 
revealed that the core region of SPOP promoter was hypermethylated in CRC 
tissues and its methylation was correlated with poor survival. Transcription 
factor RXRA had a vital role in the regulation of SPOP gene. The data indicated 
that DNA methylation at -167â€‰bp of the SPOP gene altered the binding affinity 
between transcription factor RXRA and SPOP promoter. Moreover, SPOP was found to 
associate with Gli2 and promoted its ubiquitination and degradation in CRC. 
Consequently, the expression level of Hh/Gli2 pathway-related apoptotic protein 
Bcl-2 was decreased and the function of resisting cell death was inhibited in 
CRC. It suggests that methylation status of SPOP promoter can be used as a novel 
epigenetic biomarker and a therapeutic target in CRC.
