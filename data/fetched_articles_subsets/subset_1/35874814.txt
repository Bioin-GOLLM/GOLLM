Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were developed as 
insulinotropic and anti-hyperglycemic agents for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes, but their neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities have been 
receiving increasing attention. Myelin plays a key role in the functional 
maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and recent in vivo 
and in vitro studies have shed light on the beneficial effects of GLP-1RAs on 
the formation and protection of myelin. In this article, we describe the 
potential efficacy of GLP-1RAs for the induction of axonal regeneration and 
remyelination following nerve lesions and the prevention and alleviation of 
demyelinating disorders, particularly multiple sclerosis.
