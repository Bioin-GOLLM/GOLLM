Genomic amplification followed by direct sequencing enabled us to establish the 
causative mutation in 67 unrelated hemophilia B patients of predominantly German 
origin. With the detection of the mutation, extensive pedigree analysis has 
become feasible. We therefore anticipated that determination of the origin of 
mutation could be achieved in a comparatively great number of families. Although 
these investigations often were restricted by the availability of blood samples 
from the maternal grandparents or great-grandparents, we were able to prove a de 
novo mutation in 9 of 20 families with sporadic hemophilia B and in 3 of 20 
families with a history of the disease. This could be achieved with the aid of 
RFLP analysis and, in one case, where the mutation is still unknown, with the 
aid of biochemical and immunological factor IX assays. Since the maternal 
grandfather was decreased in two of these families, the germ line of origin 
could not be determined precisely. In the remaining families, the female and 
male germ lines turned out to be the origin of mutation in six and four cases, 
respectively, and an effect of paternal age on the mutations observed could not 
be excluded. Furthermore, our data indicate that the hemophilia B gene pool is 
mainly renewed by variable mutations.
