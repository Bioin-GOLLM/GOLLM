The cellular uptake mechanism and intracellular fate of self-assembled 
nanoparticles (NPs) of cholesterol-modified pullulan (CHSP) by human 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells were investigated. Covalent conjugation 
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) yielded stably labeled CHSP (FITC-CHSP), 
which was successfully formulated into NPs (mean particle size 63.0 Â± 1.9 nm) by 
dialysis. A cytotoxicity assay clearly indicated that the CHSP NPs did not show 
significant toxicity in HepG2 cells. The effects of NP concentration, incubation 
time, and temperature on the cellular uptake of the NPs were systematically 
evaluated by fluorometry, and the results suggested that cellular uptake of the 
NPs was concentration-,time-, and temperature-dependent. In vitro experiments 
with endocytic inhibitors revealed that clathrin-mediated endocytosis and 
macropinocytosis were involved in the internalization of CHSP NPs. The 
intracellular trafficking study demonstrated that CHSP NPs were entrapped in the 
lysosomes at 1 hour after incubation; colocalization of NPs with either the 
Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticula was not observed during the entire 
course of the study. These results suggested that the CHSP NPs may serve as a 
versatile carrier for intracellular delivery of therapeutic agents.
