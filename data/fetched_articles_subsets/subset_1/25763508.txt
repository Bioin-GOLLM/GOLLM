Objective/context: We describe the second patient presenting the combination of 
two homoallelic homozygous nonsense mutations in two genes distant from 1.8 Mb 
in the chromosome 2p13-3, the methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase gene (MCEE) and the 
sepiapterin reductase gene (SPR).
CASE REPORT: The patient was born from consanguineous parents. He has presented 
a moderate but constant methylmalonic acid (MMA) excretion in urine associated 
with a mental retardation. The first homozygous mutation was identified in the 
MCEE gene (c.139C>T; p.Arg47*). Progressive dystonia and cataplexy narcolepsy 
led to diagnose the second homozygous mutation in the SPR gene: c.751A>T; 
p.Lys251*. Sepiapterin reductase deficiency (SRD) was characterized by a defect 
in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the cofactor of several hydroxylases needed for 
the synthesis of neurotransmitters. A treatment with L-DOPA/carbidopa and 5-HTP 
dramatically improved the dystonic posture, the mood and the hypersomnia, 
proving that the pathogenesis was due to SRD. A supplementation with BH4 did not 
induce additional clinical benefit, although HVA and HIAA increased in CSF. The 
polyunsaturated fatty acids were measured in CSF as the markers of the neuronal 
stress. We have shown that DHA and its precursor EPA were high before and during 
the time course of the different treatments.
IN CONCLUSION: The patient has inherited two copies of the two mutations from 
his consanguineous parents in the MCEE and SPR genes in the chromosome 2p13-3. 
DHA and EPA increased in CSF as a response to the neuronal stress induced by the 
defect in neurotransmitters or the altered metabolism of the odd-chain fatty 
acids and cholesterol.
