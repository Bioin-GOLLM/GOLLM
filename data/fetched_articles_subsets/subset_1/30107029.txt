BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a debilitating hereditary 
disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an anion channel. Wild type-CFTR gating is 
a non-equilibrium process. After ATP binding, CFTR enters a stable open state 
(O1 ). ATP hydrolysis leads it to a short-lived post-hydrolytic open state (O2 
), from which channels close. Here, we use mutations to probe the mechanism of 
VX-770, the first compound directly targeting the CFTR protein approved for 
treatment of CF. D1370N and K1250R mutations reduce or abolish catalytic 
activity, simplifying the gating scheme to an equilibrium (C↔O1 ); K464A-CFTR 
has a destabilized O1 state and rarely closes via hydrolysis.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Potentiation by VX-770 was measured using microscopic 
imaging of HEK293 cells expressing an anion-sensitive YFP-CFTR. A simple 
mathematical model was used to predict fluorescence quenching following 
extracellular iodide addition and estimate CFTR conductance. Membrane density of 
CFTR channels was measured in a parallel assay, using CFTR-pHTomato.
KEY RESULTS: VX-770 strongly potentiated WT-CFTR, D1370N-CFTR and K1250R-CFTR. 
K464A-CFTR was also strongly potentiated, regardless of whether it retained 
catalytic activity or not.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Similar potentiation of hydrolytic and 
non-hydrolytic mutants suggests that VX-770 increases CFTR open probability 
mainly by stabilizing pre-hydrolytic O1 states with respect to closed states. 
Potentiation of K464A-CFTR channels suggests action of VX-770 did not strongly 
alter conformational dynamics at site 1. Understanding potentiator mechanism 
could help develop improved treatment for CF patients. The fluorescence assay 
presented here is a robust tool for such investigations.
