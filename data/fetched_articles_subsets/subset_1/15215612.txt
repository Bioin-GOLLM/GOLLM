We prepared several mutants of the J3/4 and P4 domains of Escherichia coli 
ribonuclease P (RNase P): A62G, A62U, G63C/G64C, A65G, A67G, U69A, U69G, U69C, 
U69Delta, and U69UU. Comparison of the ribozyme and holo enzyme reactions at 
various concentrations of magnesium ions showed that the presence of a bulge at 
U69 in the P4 domain was important in the holo enzyme. The results also showed 
that the conserved bases G63 and G64 in the J3/4 domain were important for 
efficient ribozyme reactions but were replaceable in the presence of the protein 
component. Our data showed that the bases in the J3/4 and P4 domains displayed 
different responses to the metal ions that were affected by the presence of the 
protein component.
