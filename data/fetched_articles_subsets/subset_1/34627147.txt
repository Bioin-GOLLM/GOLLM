Inducible systems for transgene expression activated by a chemical inducer or an 
inducer of non-plant origin are desirable tools for both basic plant research 
and biotechnology. Although, the technology has been widely exploited in 
dicotyledonous model plants such as Arabidopsis, it has not been optimised for 
use with the monocotyledonous model species, namely rice. We have adapted the 
dexamethasone-inducible pOp6/LhGR system for rice and the results indicated that 
it is fast, sensitive and tightly regulated, with high levels of induction that 
remain stable over several generations. Most importantly, we have shown that the 
system does not cause negative growth defects in vitro or in soil grown plants. 
Interestingly in the process of testing, we found that another steroid, 
triamcinolone acetonide, is a more potent inducer in rice than dexamethasone. We 
present serious considerations for the construct design to avoid undesirable 
effects caused by the system in plants, leakiness and possible silencing, as 
well as simple steps to maximize translation efficiency of a gene of interest. 
Finally, we compare the performance of the pOp6/LhGR system with other 
chemically inducible systems tested in rice in terms of the properties of an 
ideal inducible system.
