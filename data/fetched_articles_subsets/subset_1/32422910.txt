Actomyosin-mediated contractility is required for the majority of force-driven 
cellular events such as cell division, adhesion, and migration. Under 
pathological conditions, the role of actomyosin contractility in malignant 
phenotypes of various solid tumors has been extensively discussed, but the 
pathophysiological relevance in hematopoietic malignancies has yet to be 
elucidated. In this study, we found enhanced actomyosin contractility in diverse 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines represented by highly expressed 
non-muscle myosin heavy chain A (NMIIA) and increased phosphorylation of the 
myosin regulatory light chain. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of 
actomyosin contractility induced multivalent malignancy- suppressive effects in 
AML cells. In this context, perturbed actomyosin contractility enhances AML cell 
apoptosis through cytokinesis failure and aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation. 
Moreover, leukemic oncogenes were downregulated by the YAP/TAZ-mediated 
mechanotransduction pathway. Our results provide a theoretical background for 
targeting actomyosin contractility to suppress the malignancy of AML cells.
