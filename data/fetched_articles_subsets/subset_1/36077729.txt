Although the genetic contribution to colorectal cancer (CRC) has been studied in 
various populations, studies on the applicability of available genetic 
information in the Basque population are scarce. In total, 835 CRC cases and 940 
controls from the Basque population were genotyped and genome-wide association 
studies were carried out. Mendelian Randomization analyses were used to discover 
the effect of modifiable risk factors and microbiota on CRC. In total, 25 
polygenic risk score models were evaluated to assess their performance in CRC 
risk calculation. Moreover, 492 inflammatory bowel disease cases were used to 
assess whether that genetic information would not confuse both conditions. Five 
suggestive (p < 5 × 10−6) loci were associated with CRC risk, where genes 
previously associated with CRC were located (e.g., ABCA12, ATIC or ERBB4). 
Moreover, the analyses of CRC locations detected additional genes consistent 
with the biology of CRC. The possible contribution of cholesterol, BMI, 
Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria to CRC risk was detected by Mendelian 
Randomization. Finally, although polygenic risk score models showed variable 
performance, the best model performed correctly regardless of the location and 
did not misclassify inflammatory bowel disease cases. Our results are consistent 
with CRC biology and genetic risk models and could be applied to assess CRC risk 
in the Basque population.
