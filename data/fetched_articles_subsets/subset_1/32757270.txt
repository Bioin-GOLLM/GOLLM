Capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome (CiHFS) is a common dermatological 
adverse reaction affecting around 30% of patients with capecitabine-treated 
cancer, and the main cause of dose reductions and chemotherapy delays. To 
identify novel genetic factors associated with CiHFS in patients with cancer, we 
carried out an extreme-phenotype genomewide association study in 166 patients 
with breast and colorectal capecitabine-treated cancer with replication in a 
second cohort of 85 patients. We discovered and replicated a cluster of four 
highly correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with susceptibility 
to CiHFS at 20q13.33 locus (top hit = rs6129058, hazard ratio = 2.40, 95% 
confidence interval = 1.78-3.20; P = 1.2 × 10-8 ). Using circular chromosome 
conformation capture sequencing, we identified a chromatin contact between the 
locus containing the risk alleles and the promoter of CDH4, located 90 kilobases 
away. The risk haplotype was associated with decreased levels of CDH4 mRNA and 
the protein it encodes, R-cadherin (RCAD), which mainly localizes in the 
granular layer of the epidermis. In human keratinocytes, CDH4 downregulation 
resulted in reduced expression of involucrin, a protein of the cornified 
envelope, an essential structure for skin barrier function. Immunohistochemical 
analyses revealed that skin from patients with severe CiHFS exhibited low levels 
of RCAD and involucrin before capecitabine treatment. Our results uncover a 
novel mechanism underlying individual genetic susceptibility to CiHFS with 
implications for clinically relevant risk prediction.
