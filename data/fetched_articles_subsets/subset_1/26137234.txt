Previously, our studies identified nine genes and the chromosomal region 3q28 as 
susceptibility loci for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or chronic kidney 
disease in individuals by genome-wide or candidate gene association studies. The 
present study examined the possible association of 13 polymorphisms at these 10 
loci with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in community-dwelling 
individuals. Study subjects comprised 6,027 individuals (797 subjects with type 
2 DM and 5,230 controls) who were recruited to the Inabe Health and Longevity 
Study, a longitudinal genetic epidemiological study of atherosclerotic, 
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The subjects were recruited from 
individuals who visited for an annual health checkup and they were followed up 
each year (mean follow-up, 5 years). Longitudinal analysis with a generalized 
estimating equation and with adjustment for age, gender and body mass index 
(BMI) revealed that rs2116519 (C→T) of FAM78B (P=0.0188), as well as rs2074379 
(G→A, P=0.0121) and rs2074388 (A→G, P=0.0053) of ALPK1 were significantly 
(P<0.05) associated with the prevalence of type 2 DM. Longitudinal analysis with 
a generalized linear mixed-effect model and with adjustment for age, gender and 
BMI among all the individuals revealed that rs2116519, rs2074379 and rs2074388 
were significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose level (P=0.0352, 
0.0017 and 0.0010, respectively) and to blood glycosylated hemoglobin 
(hemoglobin A1c) content (P=0.0065, 0.0090 and 0.0079, respectively). Similar 
analysis among individuals not taking antidiabetic medication revealed that 
rs2074379 and rs2074388 were associated with the fasting plasma glucose level 
(P=0.0073 and 0.0042, respectively) and blood hemoglobin A1c content (P=0.0142 
and 0.0126, respectively), whereas rs2116519 was associated with blood 
hemoglobin A1c content only (P=0.0470). ALPK1 may thus be a susceptibility gene 
for type 2 DM.
