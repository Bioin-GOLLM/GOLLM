Genome wide association studies for coronary artery disease (CAD) have 
identified a risk locus at 11q22.3. Here, we verify with mechanistic studies 
that rs2019090 and PDGFD represent the functional variant and gene at this 
locus. Further, FOXC1/C2 transcription factor binding at rs2019090 is shown to 
promote PDGFD transcription through the CAD promoting allele. With single cell 
transcriptomic and histology studies with Pdgfd knockdown in an SMC lineage 
tracing male atherosclerosis mouse model we find that Pdgfd promotes expansion, 
migration, and transition of SMC lineage cells to the chondromyocyte phenotype. 
Pdgfd also increases adventitial fibroblast and pericyte expression of 
chemokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules, which is linked to plaque 
macrophage recruitment. Despite these changes there is no effect of Pdgfd 
deletion on overall plaque burden. These findings suggest that PDGFD mediates 
CAD risk by promoting deleterious phenotypic changes in SMC, along with an 
inflammatory response that is primarily focused in the adventitia.
