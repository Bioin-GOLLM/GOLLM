OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between glycosylated hemoglobin A 
(HbA1c) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in stroke patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of stroke patients from 
January 2012 to December 2013. We reviewed 331 patients and included 200 in the 
analysis. We divided them into CRPS and non-CRPS groups and compared them by 
age, gender, stroke lesion, cause of stroke, duration of T2DM, HbA1c (%), 
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, affected shoulder flexor 
muscle strength, Fugl-Meyer Assessment score, motricity index, Functional 
Independence Measure, Korean version of Modified Barthel Index, blood glucose 
level on admission day, duration from stroke onset to HbA1c check, and duration 
from stroke onset to three-phase bone scan for CRPS diagnosis. Thereafter, we 
classified the patients into five groups by HbA1c level (group 1, 5.0%-5.9%; 
group 2, 6.0%-6.9%; group 3, 7.0%-7.9%; group 4, 8.0%-8.9%; and group 5, 
9.0%-9.9%) and we investigated the difference in CRPS prevalence between the two 
groups.
RESULTS: Of the 200 patients, 108 were in the CRPS group and 92 were in the 
non-CRPS group. There were significant differences in HbA1c (p<0.05) between the 
two groups but no significant differences in any other factors. Across the five 
HbA1c groups, there were significant differences in CRPS prevalence (p<0.01); 
specifically, it increased as HbA1c increased.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that higher HbA1c relates to higher CRPS 
prevalence and thus that uncontrolled blood glucose can affect CRPS occurrence 
in stroke patients with diabetes.
