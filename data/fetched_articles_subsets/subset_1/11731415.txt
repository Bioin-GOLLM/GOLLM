HER-2 gene amplification and protein overexpression has been associated with 
increased risk of advanced-stage breast cancer and poor prognosis. Recently, a 
single missense point mutation (Ile(655)Val) in the transmembrane domain of the 
HER-2 gene was associated with a 40% increase in breast cancer risk among women 
45 years of age and younger. In this analysis, we measured the association 
between the Ile(655)Val variant and postmenopausal breast cancer among women 
participating in the Hawaii and Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort. Risk of 
localized breast cancer was significantly elevated among women with the HER-2 
variant, but not among women with regional or metastatic disease. Women with at 
least one copy of the Valine variant were approximately one-half as likely to 
have high-stage as low-stage breast cancer (P =.02), and this effect was present 
across racial/ethnic groups.
