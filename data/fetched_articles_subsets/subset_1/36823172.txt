Diffuse midline glioma-H3K27M mutant (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are the most 
lethal brain tumors that primarily occur in pediatric and adult patients, 
respectively. Both tumors exhibit significant heterogeneity, shaped by distinct 
genetic/epigenetic drivers, transcriptional programs including RNA splicing, and 
microenvironmental cues in glioma niches. However, the spatial organization of 
cellular states and niche-specific regulatory programs remain to be 
investigated. Here, we perform a spatial profiling of DMG and GBM combining 
short- and long-read spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell transcriptomic 
datasets. We identify clinically relevant transcriptional programs, RNA isoform 
diversity, and multi-cellular ecosystems across different glioma niches. We find 
that while the tumor core enriches for oligodendrocyte precursor-like cells, 
radial glial stem-like (RG-like) cells are enriched in the neuron-rich invasive 
niche in both DMG and GBM. Further, we identify niche-specific regulatory 
programs for RG-like cells, and functionally confirm that FAM20C mediates 
invasive growth of RG-like cells in a neuron-rich microenvironment in a human 
neural stem cell derived orthotopic DMG model. Together, our results provide a 
blueprint for understanding the spatial architecture and niche-specific 
vulnerabilities of DMG and GBM.
