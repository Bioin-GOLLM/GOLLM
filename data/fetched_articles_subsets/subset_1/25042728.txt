INTRODUCTION: VKORC1 and cytochrome CYP2C9 genetic variants contribute largely 
to inter-individual variations in vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) dose 
requirements. Cytochrome P450 4F2 isoform (CYP4F2), gamma-glutamyl carboxylase 
(GGCX) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms have been suggested to be of 
minor significance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sought to assess the impact of those polymorphisms on 
dose requirements in Central-Eastern European cohort of 479 patients receiving 
acenocoumarol (n=260) or warfarin (n=219).
RESULTS: There were no differences between the acenocoumarol and warfarin groups 
with regard to the gender, age, body mass index and international normalized 
ratio. The VKORC1 c.-1639A allele carriers required a lower dose of 
acenocoumarol and warfarin than the non-carriers (28.0 [21.0-35.0] vs. 42.0 
[28.0-56.0] mg/week, p<0.0001; 35.0 [28.0-52.0] vs. 52.0 [35.0-70.0] mg/week, 
p=0.0001, respectively). Carriers of 2 and/or 3 variant alleles for CYP2C9 also 
required a lower dose of warfarin as compared with 1 1 carriers (35.0 
[31.5-52.5] vs. 43.8 [35.0-60.2] mg/week, p=0.02; 35.0 [23.5-35.0] vs. 43.8 
[35.0-60.2] mg/week, p<0.0001, respectively). Similarly, possession of G allele 
of GGCX c.2084+45 polymorphism was associated with lower warfarin dose (35.0 
[26.3-39.2] vs. 45.5 [35.0-65.1] mg/week, p=0.03). No effect of CYP2C9*2,-*3 and 
GGCX c.2084+45G>C polymorphisms on acenocoumarol dosage was observed. 
Interestingly, carriers of CYP4F2 c.1297A variant required a higher dose of 
acenocoumarol and warfarin than non-carriers (43.8 [35.0-60.2] vs. 35.0 
[35.0-52.5] mg/week, p=0.01; 35.0 [28.0-52.5] vs. 28.0 [28.0-42.0] mg/week, 
p=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time, that besides VKORC1 and CYP2C9 
genetic variants, the CYP4F2 c.1297A and GGCX c.2084+45G have a moderate effect 
on VKAs dose requirements in Slavic population from Central-Eastern Europe.
