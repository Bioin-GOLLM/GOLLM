Functional heterogeneity within the lipid droplet (LD) pool of a single cell has 
been observed, yet the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here, we report 
on identification of a specialized LD subpopulation characterized by a unique 
proteome and a defined geographical location at the nucleus-vacuole junction 
contact site. In search for factors determining identity of these LDs, we 
screened ∼6,000 yeast mutants for loss of targeting of the subpopulation marker 
Pdr16 and identified Ldo45 (LD organization protein of 45 kD) as a crucial 
targeting determinant. Ldo45 is the product of a splicing event connecting two 
adjacent genes (YMR147W and YMR148W/OSW5/LDO16). We show that Ldo proteins 
cooperate with the LD biogenesis component seipin and establish LD identity by 
defining positioning and surface-protein composition. Our studies suggest a 
mechanism to establish functional differentiation of organelles, opening the 
door to better understanding of metabolic decisions in cells.
