PURPOSE: To report the genetic basis for congenital glaucoma with clinical 
aniridia in an infant and a milder phenotype in her mother.
METHODS: Prospective case series.
RESULTS: An infant girl with almost complete lack of iris tissue was referred 
and treated for congenital glaucoma. Although the presumed clinical diagnosis 
was aniridia (On-line Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] AN2, # 106210), PAX6 
sequencing was normal. Examination of the infant's mother was significant for 
Axenfeld-Rieger malformation (ARM): prominent Schwabe line, subtle iris 
hypoplasia, iris stands bridging the angle, increased intraocular pressure, and 
glaucomatous optic nerve cupping. Both parents and the infant underwent 
diagnostic FOXC1 DNA sequencing. A heterozygous M161K FOXC1 mutation was found 
in the infant and her mother but not in the father, who had a normal ocular 
examination.
DISCUSSION: The spectrum of intrafamilial phenotypic variation associated with 
heterozygous FOXC1 mutation can be wide. FOXC1 mutation can be a cause of 
congenital glaucoma with clinical aniridia. Although such infants resemble the 
AN2 phenotype, the glaucoma of AN2 due to PAX6 mutation is typically secondary 
with onset several years after birth.
