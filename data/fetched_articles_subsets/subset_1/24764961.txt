In the title compound, C17H17NO2, the carbazole skeleton includes an 
eth-oxy-carbonyl group at the 3-position. The indole three-ring system is almost 
planar [maximum deviation = 0.065 (2) Å], and the ethyl ester group is inclined 
to its mean plane by 15.48 (2)°. In the crystal, there are π-π stacking 
inter-actions between parallel benzene rings and between parallel benzene and 
pyrrole rings of adjacent mol-ecules [centroid-centroid distances = 3.9473 (8) 
and 3.7758 (8) Å, respectively]. Weak C-H⋯π inter-actions are also present.
