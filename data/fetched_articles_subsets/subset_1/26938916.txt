BAHD1 is a vertebrate protein that promotes heterochromatin formation and gene 
repression in association with several epigenetic regulators. However, its 
physiological roles remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ablation of the 
Bahd1 gene results in hypocholesterolemia, hypoglycemia and decreased body fat 
in mice. It also causes placental growth restriction with a drop of trophoblast 
glycogen cells, a reduction of fetal weight and a high neonatal mortality rate. 
By intersecting transcriptome data from murine Bahd1 knockout (KO) placentas at 
stages E16.5 and E18.5 of gestation, Bahd1-KO embryonic fibroblasts, and human 
cells stably expressing BAHD1, we also show that changes in BAHD1 levels alter 
expression of steroid/lipid metabolism genes. Biochemical analysis of the 
BAHD1-associated multiprotein complex identifies MIER proteins as novel partners 
of BAHD1 and suggests that BAHD1-MIER interaction forms a hub for histone 
deacetylases and methyltransferases, chromatin readers and transcription 
factors. We further show that overexpression of BAHD1 leads to an increase of 
MIER1 enrichment on the inactive X chromosome (Xi). In addition, BAHD1 and 
MIER1/3 repress expression of the steroid hormone receptor genes ESR1 and PGR, 
both playing important roles in placental development and energy metabolism. 
Moreover, modulation of BAHD1 expression in HEK293 cells triggers epigenetic 
changes at the ESR1 locus. Together, these results identify BAHD1 as a core 
component of a chromatin-repressive complex regulating placental morphogenesis 
and body fat storage and suggest that its dysfunction may contribute to several 
human diseases.
