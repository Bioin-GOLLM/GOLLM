Using Caenorhabditis elegans as an infection host model for Vibrio cholerae 
predator interactions, we discovered a bacterial cytotoxin, MakA, whose function 
as a virulence factor relies on secretion via the flagellum channel in a proton 
motive force-dependent manner. The MakA protein is expressed from the 
polycistronic makDCBA (motility-associated killing factor) operon. Bacteria 
expressing makDCBA induced dramatic changes in intestinal morphology leading to 
a defecation defect, starvation and death in C. elegans. The Mak proteins also 
promoted V. cholerae colonization of the zebrafish gut causing lethal infection. 
A structural model of purified MakA at 1.9 Å resolution indicated similarities 
to members of a superfamily of bacterial toxins with unknown biological roles. 
Our findings reveal an unrecognized role for V. cholerae flagella in cytotoxin 
export that may contribute both to environmental spread of the bacteria by 
promoting survival and proliferation in encounters with predators, and to 
pathophysiological effects during infections.
