Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolite precursor for the biosynthesis of lipids, 
polyketides, isoprenoids, amino acids, and numerous other bioproducts which are 
used in various industries. Metabolic engineering efforts aim to increase carbon 
flux towards acetyl-CoA in order to achieve higher productivities of its 
downstream products. In this review, we summarize the strategies that have been 
implemented for increasing acetyl-CoA flux and concentration, and discuss their 
effects. Furthermore, recent works have developed synthetic acetyl-CoA 
biosynthesis routes that achieve higher stoichiometric yield of acetyl-CoA from 
glycolytic substrates.
