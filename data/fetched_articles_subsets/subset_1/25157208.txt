Argyrophylic grain disease (AGD) is a neurodegenerative condition that has been 
classified among the sporadic tauopathies. Entities in this group present 
intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau, giving rise to 
characteristic neuronal and glial inclusions. In different tauopathies, the 
proportion of several tau isoforms present in the aggregates shows specific 
patterns. AGD has been tentatively classified in the 4R group (predominance of 
4R tau isoforms) together with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal 
degeneration. Pick's disease is included in the 3R group (predominance of 3R 
isoforms), whereas tau pathology of Alzheimer's disease represents and 
intermediate group (3 or 4 repeats [3R plus 4R, respectively] isoforms). In this 
work, we have analyzed tau present in aggregates isolated from brain samples of 
patients with argyrophylic grain disease. Our results indicate that the main tau 
isoform present in aggregates obtained from patients with AGD is a 
hyperphosphorylated isoform containing exons 2 and 10 but lacking exon 3.
