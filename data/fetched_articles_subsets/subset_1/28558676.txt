BACKGROUND: The feature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 
pathological excessive liver lipid accumulation of subjects who without history 
of alcohol abuse. Calf circumference is a proxy for lower-body fat and screening 
method for the identification of subjects with acatastatic lipid accumulation. 
The objective of this study was to examine the association between calf 
circumference and NAFLD.
METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional analysis including 8850 middle-aged and 
elderly individuals. NAFLD was examined by hepatic ultrasound and without 
alcohol abuse and other liver diseases. Calf circumference was measured on the 
lower right leg at the point of maximal circumference.
RESULTS: The mean of calf circumference were 35.7 cm for male and 34.6 cm for 
female (P < 0.001), respectively. Compared with the lowest calf circumference 
quartile, the odds ratio for NAFLD in the highest quartile was 2.73 (95% CI 
2.34-3.19, P trend <0.001) after adjusted for potential cofounders. There were 
also significant positive correlation between calf circumference and HOMA-IR, 
liver enzyme levels and triglycerides. In addition, we found significant 
positive correlation of calf circumference with the HOMA-IR and fasting insulin 
level in overweight and obese subjects (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2) but not in lean subjects 
(test for interaction: P both less than 0.001 for insulin and HOMA-IR).
CONCLUSION: High calf circumference is significantly associated with elevated 
prevalence of NAFLD and increasing insulin resistance.
