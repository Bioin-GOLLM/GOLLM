Some studies have reported a genetic association between single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of Interleukin (IL) 10 and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), with conflicting results. To further investigate the 
proposed association and to clarify the role of cytokines as a potential cause 
for AD susceptibility, we analyzed genotypes, allele distributions and 
haplotypes of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms -1082 (rs1800896) and -819 
(rs1800871) in a Mexican population: 986 normal controls and 221 cases divided 
as follows: 122 with Alzheimer disease (AD), 67 with (VaD) and 32 with mixed 
dementia (AD/VaD). Patients with dementia showed increased frequency of "ATA, 
CTG, and CTA" haplotypes when compared to controls. We identified two risk 
haplotypes: ATA (OR=3.56, 95%CI=2.84-4.45, p<0.0001), and CTA (OR=1.90, 
95%CI=1.38-2.62, p<0.0001), and four protection haplotypes: ATG (OR=0.60, 
95%CI=0.45-0.82, p=0.0012), CTG (OR=0.38, 95%CI=0.23-0.62, p<0.0001), ACG 
(OR=0.01, 95%CI=0.002-1.13, p<0.0001), and CCG (OR=0.02, 95%CI=0.004-0.203, 
p<0.0001). In summary, this is the first study in Mexican population that 
considers the analysis of IL-10 in patients with AD, VaD and AD/VaD. Our results 
showed the relevance of the role that IL-10 plays in the pathological mechanisms 
that result in the development of dementia. In addition, in our study, it was 
possible to distinguish two protective and two risk haplotypes for the 
development of dementia.
