Recombinant immunotoxin for the treatment of cancer was made by connecting 
toxins to 'carcinoma-specific' antibodies that selectively bind to cancer cells, 
then kills them without harming the normal cells. The divalent recombinant 
immunotoxin, [B3(Fab)-ext-PE38]2, is a derivative of B3(Fab)-PE38. B3(Fab)-PE38 
was made by fusing the Fab domain of the monoclonal antibody (MAb) B3 to PE38, a 
truncated mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). In this study, 
B3(Fab)-ext-PE38 was constructed, which has the hinge region of the B3(Fab)-PE38 
extended with the peptide extension, G4C(G4S)2, and connected to the C3 
connector. The Cys residue of the extension peptide chain makes the disulfide 
bond between the two Fab domains. The extension sequence (ext) makes the 
dimerization of B3(Fab)-ext-PE38 easier to form the divalent immunotoxin, 
because it decreases the steric hindrance between the two PE38s. The constructed 
genes were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. Polypeptides that were 
obtained from the inclusion body were refolded, and the active forms were 
purified. The ID50 values of the divalent molecule, [B3(Fab)-ext-PE38]2, were 
about 4 ng/ml on A431 cell lines, about 1 ng/ml on CRL1739 cell lines, and 5 
ng/ml on MCF-7 cell lines. The [B3(Fab)-ext-PE38]2 showed about a 12-fold higher 
cytotoxicity on CRL1739 cell lines than B3(scFv)-PE40 did.
