Frequent codirectional collisions between the replisome and RNA polymerase 
(RNAP) are inevitable because the rate of replication is much faster than that 
of transcription. Here we show that, in E. coli, the outcome of such collisions 
depends on the productive state of transcription elongation complexes (ECs). 
Codirectional collisions with backtracked (arrested) ECs lead to DNA 
double-strand breaks (DSBs), whereas head-on collisions do not. A mechanistic 
model is proposed to explain backtracking-mediated DSBs. We further show that 
bacteria employ various strategies to avoid replisome collisions with 
backtracked RNAP, the most general of which is translation that prevents RNAP 
backtracking. If translation is abrogated, DSBs are suppressed by elongation 
factors that either prevent backtracking or reactivate backtracked ECs. Finally, 
termination factors also contribute to genomic stability by removing arrested 
ECs. Our results establish RNAP backtracking as the intrinsic hazard to 
chromosomal integrity and implicate active ribosomes and other anti-backtracking 
mechanisms in genome maintenance.
