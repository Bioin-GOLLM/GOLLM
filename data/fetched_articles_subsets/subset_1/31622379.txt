BACKGROUND: Increased serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an important 
component of the innate immune response, are associated with increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 
have been identified which are associated with CRP levels, and Mendelian 
randomization studies have shown a positive association between SNPs increasing 
CRP expression and risk of colon cancer (but thus far not CVD). The effects of 
individual genetic variants often interact with the genetic background of a 
population and hence we sought to resolve the genetic determinants of serum CRP 
in a number of American Indian populations.
METHODS: The Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) has serum CRP measurements from 
2428 tribal members, recruited as large families from three regions of the 
United States. Microsatellite markers and MetaboChip defined SNP genotypes were 
incorporated into variance components, decomposition-based linkage and 
association analyses.
RESULTS: CRP levels exhibited significant heritability (h2 = 0.33 Â± 0.05, p<1.3 
X 10-20). A locus on chromosome (chr) 6, near marker D6S281 (approximately at 
169.6 Mb, GRCh38/hg38) showed suggestive linkage (LOD = 1.9) to CRP levels. No 
individual SNPs were found associated with CRP levels after Bonferroni 
adjustment for multiple testing (threshold <7.77 x 10-7), however, we found 
nominal associations, many of which replicate previous findings at the CRP, 
HNF1A and 7 other loci. In addition, we report association of 46 SNPs located at 
7 novel loci on chromosomes 2, 5, 6(2 loci), 9, 10 and 17, with an average of 
15.3 Kb between SNPs and all with p-values less than 7.2 X 10-4.
CONCLUSION: In agreement with evidence from other populations, these data show 
CRP serum levels are under considerable genetic influence; and include loci, 
such as near CRP and other genes, that replicate results from other ethnic 
groups. These findings also suggest possible novel loci on chr 6 and other 
chromosomes that warrant further investigation.
