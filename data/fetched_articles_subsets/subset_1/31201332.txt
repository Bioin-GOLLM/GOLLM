The brain stores and recalls memories through a set of neurons, termed engram 
cells. However, it is unclear how these cells are organized to constitute a 
corresponding memory trace. We established a unique imaging system that combines 
Ca2+ imaging and engram identification to extract the characteristics of engram 
activity by visualizing and discriminating between engram and non-engram cells. 
Here, we show that engram cells detected in the hippocampus display higher 
repetitive activity than non-engram cells during novel context learning. The 
total activity pattern of the engram cells during learning is stable across 
post-learning memory processing. Within a single engram population, we detected 
several sub-ensembles composed of neurons collectively activated during 
learning. Some sub-ensembles preferentially reappear during post-learning sleep, 
and these replayed sub-ensembles are more likely to be reactivated during 
retrieval. These results indicate that sub-ensembles represent distinct pieces 
of information, which are then orchestrated to constitute an entire memory.
