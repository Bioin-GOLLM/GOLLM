BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PPGL) are known as tumors with 
the highest level of heritability, approximately 30% of all cases. Clinical 
practice guidelines of PPGL recommend genetic testing for germline variants in 
all patients. In this study, we used whole exome sequencing to identify novel 
causative variants associated with PPGL to improve the detection of rare genetic 
variants in our cohort.
METHODS: Thirty-six tested negative for pathogenic variants in previous Sanger 
sequencing or targeted gene panel testing for PPGL underwent whole exome 
sequencing. Whole exome sequencing was performed using DNA samples enriched 
using TruSeq Custom Enrichment Kit and sequenced with MiSeq (Illumina Inc.). 
Sequencing alignment and variant calling were performed using SAMtools.
RESULTS: Among previously mutation undetected 36 patients, two likely pathogenic 
variants and 13 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were detected in 32 
pheochromocytoma-related genes. SDHA c.778G>A (p.Gly260Arg) was detected in a 
patient with head and neck paraganglioma, and KIF1B c.2787-2A>C in a patient 
with a bladder paraganglioma. Additionally, a likely pathogenic variant in 
BRCA2, VUS in TP53, and VUS in NFU1 were detected.
CONCLUSION: Exome sequencing further identified genetic alterations by 5.6% in 
previously mutation undetected patients in PPGL. Implementation of targeted gene 
sequencing consisted of extended genes of PPGL in routine clinical screening can 
support the level of comprehensive patient assessment.
