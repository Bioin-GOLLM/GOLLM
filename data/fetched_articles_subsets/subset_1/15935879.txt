Following the anthrax attacks of 2001 and the recent SARS outbreak, concerns 
about emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases have catalyzed a renewed 
interest in developing new vaccination strategies that provide rapid and 
flexible response options to future threats. Because the probability of 
encountering one of these exotic agents is unknown, it is essential that new 
vaccine formulations employ methods that provide effective protection and 
extremely good safety profiles if they are to be used by either military or 
civilian populations. One approach, which potentially satisfies these criteria, 
is the use of live recombinant Gram-positive commensal bacteria as expression 
vectors. This review provides an overview of the system, its advantages and 
limitations, and details an example of how Gram-positive commensal bacteria are 
being developed as a fifth generation vaccine against a Class A biowarfare 
pathogen, namely smallpox.
