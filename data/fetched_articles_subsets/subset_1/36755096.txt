Cancers arise through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations 
that enable cells to evade telomere-based proliferative barriers and achieve 
immortality. One such barrier is replicative crisis-an autophagy-dependent 
program that eliminates checkpoint-deficient cells with unstable telomeres and 
other cancer-relevant chromosomal aberrations1,2. However, little is known about 
the molecular events that regulate the onset of this important 
tumour-suppressive barrier. Here we identified the innate immune sensor Z-DNA 
binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as a regulator of the crisis program. A 
crisis-associated isoform of ZBP1 is induced by the cGAS-STING DNA-sensing 
pathway, but reaches full activation only when associated with 
telomeric-repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) transcripts that are synthesized from 
dysfunctional telomeres. TERRA-bound ZBP1 oligomerizes into filaments on the 
outer mitochondrial membrane of a subset of mitochondria, where it activates the 
innate immune adapter protein mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein (MAVS). 
We propose that these oligomerization properties of ZBP1 serve as a signal 
amplification mechanism, where few TERRA-ZBP1 interactions are sufficient to 
launch a detrimental MAVS-dependent interferon response. Our study reveals a 
mechanism for telomere-mediated tumour suppression, whereby dysfunctional 
telomeres activate innate immune responses through mitochondrial TERRA-ZBP1 
complexes to eliminate cells destined for neoplastic transformation.
