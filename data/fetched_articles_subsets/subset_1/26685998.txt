We present the first detailed cytological study of male meiosis in Daphnia 
(Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Cladocera)-an aquatic microcrustacean with a cyclical 
parthenogenetic life cycle. Using immunostaining of the testes in Daphnia magna 
for baseline knowledge, we characterized the different stages of meiotic 
division and spermiogenesis in relation to the distribution of proteins involved 
in synapsis, early recombination events and sister chromatid cohesion. We also 
studied post-translational histone modifications in male spermatocytes, in 
relation to the dynamic chromatin progression of meiosis. Finally, we applied a 
DNA fragmentation test to measure sperm quality of D. magna, with respect to 
levels of inbreeding. As a proxy for fertility, this technique may be used to 
assess the reproductive health of a sentinel species of aquatic ecosystems. 
Daphnia proves to be a model species for comparative studies of meiosis that is 
poised to improve our understanding of the cytological basis of sexual and 
asexual reproduction.
