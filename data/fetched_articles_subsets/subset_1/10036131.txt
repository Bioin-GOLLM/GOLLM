Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is employed to directly 
analyze the limited trypsinolysis products of wild-type tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (wtTNF-alpha) and its mutant, M3S. To determine the charge numbers 
of peaks of relatively small peptides in the ESI mass spectrum of a digest, a 
series of sodium-adduct ion peaks of each peptide are generated by adding a 
small quantity of NaCl to the digest before taking the spectrum. From the 
monitoring of the composition of proteolytic mixture as the incubation time is 
lengthened, it has been learned that the proteolysis of wtTNF-alpha by trypsin 
occurs sequentially: Arg2, Arg6, Arg32, Arg31, and Arg44, and that M3S is 
strongly resistant to the proteolysis. Since the cleavage sequence of 
wtTNF-alpha and the mutation-induced resistance of M3S are consistent with the 
structural features of the proteins, we can suggest a mutant more resistant to 
proteolysis than M3S, which has an additional point mutation, Ala35Leu or 
Ala35Ile.
