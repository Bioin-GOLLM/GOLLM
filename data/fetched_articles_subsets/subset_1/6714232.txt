Complete primary structure of the collagen-binding domain of bovine fibronectin.

Skorstengaard K, Th√∏gersen HC, Petersen TE.

The complete amino acid sequence of the collagen-binding domain of bovine plasma 
fibronectin has been determined. The fragment, generated by digestion of 
fibronectin with plasmin and chymotrypsin, contains 340 residues (260-599 of 
fibronectin) with threonine and tryptophan as the amino-terminal and 
carboxyl-terminal amino acids, respectively. 24 half-cystines and no cysteines 
are present in the sequence. Three glucosamine-based oligosaccharide groups are 
attached to Asn-399, Asn-497 and to Asn-511, respectively. Two of the three 
types (I and II) [Petersen et al. (1983) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 80, 137-141] 
of internal homology occur in the fragment, namely four of the at least twelve 
stretches of type I sequence homology, 'fingers', and two stretches of type II 
homology. The type I homology is present in two other plasmic fragments from 
fibronectin, while the type II homology has been found in the collagen-binding 
domain only.
