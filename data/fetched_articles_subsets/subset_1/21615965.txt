BACKGROUND: Metastatic melanoma represents a major clinical problem. Its 
incidence continues to rise in western countries and there are currently no 
curative treatments. While mutation of the P53 tumour suppressor gene is a 
common feature of many types of cancer, mutational inactivation of P53 in 
melanoma is uncommon; however, its function often appears abnormal.
METHODS: In this study whole genome bead arrays were used to examine the 
transcript expression of P53 target genes in extracts from 82 melanoma 
metastases and 6 melanoma cell lines, to provide a global assessment of aberrant 
P53 function. The expression of these genes was also examined in extracts 
derived from diploid human melanocytes and fibroblasts.
RESULTS: The results indicated that P53 target transcripts involved in apoptosis 
were under-expressed in melanoma metastases and melanoma cell lines, while those 
involved in the cell cycle were over-expressed in melanoma cell lines. There was 
little difference in the transcript expression of P53 target genes between cell 
lines with null/mutant P53 compared to those with wild-type P53, suggesting that 
altered expression in melanoma was not related to P53 status. Similarly, 
down-regulation of P53 by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) had limited effect on P53 
target gene expression in melanoma cells, whereas there were a large number of 
P53 target genes whose mRNA expression was significantly altered by P53 
inhibition in melanocytes. Analysis of whole genome gene expression profiles 
indicated that the ability of P53 to regulate genes involved in the cell cycle 
was significantly reduced in melanoma cells. Moreover, inhibition of P53 in 
melanocytes induced changes in gene expression profiles that were characteristic 
of melanoma cells and resulted in increased proliferation. Conversely, knockdown 
of P53 in melanoma cells resulted in decreased proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that P53 target genes involved in apoptosis 
and cell cycle regulation are aberrantly expressed in melanoma and that this 
aberrant functional activity of P53 may contribute to the proliferation of 
melanoma.
