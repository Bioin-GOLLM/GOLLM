An increasing body of evidence indicates that bio-energetic metabolism of T 
cells can be manipulated to control T cell responses. This potentially finds a 
field of application in the control of the T cell responses in autoimmune 
diseases, including in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of the possible metabolic targets, 
Glut1 gained considerable interest because of its pivotal role in glucose uptake 
to fuel glycolysis in activated T cells, and the recent development of a novel 
class of small molecules that act as selective inhibitor of Glut1. We believe we 
can foresee a possible application of pharmacological Glut1 blockade approach to 
control autoreactive T cells that destroy insulin producing beta cells. However, 
Glut1 is expressed in a broad range of cells in the body and off-target and side 
effect are possible complications. Moreover, the duration of the treatment and 
the age of patients are critical aspects that need to be addressed to reduce 
toxicity. In this paper, we will review recent literature to determine whether 
it is possible to design a pharmacological Glut1 blocking strategy and how to 
apply this to autoimmunity in T1D.
