BACKGROUND: Necrotic foci with surrounding hypoxic cellular pseudopalisades and 
microvascular hyperplasia are histological features found in glioblastoma (GBM). 
We have previously shown that monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) is highly 
expressed in necrotic/hypoxic regions in GBM and that increased levels of MCT4 
are associated with worse clinical outcomes.
METHODS: A combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis was performed to 
study the effects of MCT4 depletion in hypoxic GBM neurospheres. Stable and 
inducible MCT4-depletion systems were used to evaluate the effects of and 
underlining mechanisms associated with MCT4 depletion in vitro and in vivo, 
alone and in combination with radiation.
RESULTS: This study establishes that conditional depletion of MCT4 profoundly 
impairs self-renewal and reduces the frequency and tumorigenicity of aggressive, 
therapy-resistant, glioblastoma stem cells. Mechanistically, we observed that 
MCT4 depletion induces anaplerotic glutaminolysis and abrogates de novo 
pyrimidine biosynthesis. The latter results in a dramatic increase in DNA damage 
and apoptotic cell death, phenotypes that were readily rescued by pyrimidine 
nucleosides supplementation. Consequently, we found that MCT4 depletion promoted 
a significant prolongation of survival of animals bearing established orthotopic 
xenografts, an effect that was extended by adjuvant treatment with focused 
radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings establish a novel role for MCT4 as a critical 
regulator of cellular deoxyribonucleotide levels and provide a new therapeutic 
direction related to MCT4 depletion in GBM.
