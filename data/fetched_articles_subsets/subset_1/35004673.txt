N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in RNA is a dynamic and reversible 
modification regulated by methyltransferases and demethylases, which has been 
reported to participate in many pathological processes of various diseases, 
including cardiac disorders. This study was designed to investigate an m6A 
writer Mettl14 on cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and uncover the 
underlying mechanism. The m6A and Mettl14 protein levels were increased in I/R 
hearts and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes upon oxidative stress. Mettl14 knockout 
(Mettl14+/-) mice showed pronounced increases in cardiac infarct size and LDH 
release and aggravation in cardiac dysfunction post-I/R. Conversely, 
adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Mettl14 markedly reduced infarct size and 
apoptosis and improved cardiac function during I/R injury. Silencing of Mettl14 
alone significantly caused a decrease in cell viability and an increase in LDH 
release and further exacerbated these effects in the presence of H2O2, while 
overexpression of Mettl14 ameliorated cardiomyocyte injury in vitro. Mettl14 
resulted in enhanced levels of Wnt1 m6A modification and Wnt1 protein but not 
its transcript level. Furthermore, Mettl14 overexpression blocked I/R-induced 
downregulation of Wnt1 and β-catenin proteins, whereas Mettl14+/- hearts 
exhibited the opposite results. Knockdown of Wnt1 abrogated Mettl14-mediated 
upregulation of β-catenin and protection against injury upon H2O2. Our study 
demonstrates that Mettl14 attenuates cardiac I/R injury by activating 
Wnt/β-catenin in an m6A-dependent manner, providing a novel therapeutic target 
for ischemic heart disease.
