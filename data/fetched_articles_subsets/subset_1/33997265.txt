Three-dimensional (3D) multicomponent metal oxides with complex architectures 
could enable previously impossible energy storage devices, particularly 
lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes with fully controllable form factors. 
Existing additive manufacturing approaches for fabricating 3D multicomponent 
metal oxides rely on particle-based or organic-inorganic binders, which are 
limited in their resolution and chemical composition, respectively. In this 
work, aqueous metal salt solutions are used as metal precursors to circumvent 
these limitations, and provide a platform for 3D printing multicomponent metal 
oxides. As a proof-of-concept, architected lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) structures 
are fabricated by first synthesizing a homogenous lithium and cobalt nitrate 
aqueous photoresin, and then using it with digital light processing printing to 
obtain lithium and cobalt ion containing hydrogels. The 3D hydrogels are 
calcined to obtain micro-porous self-similar LCO architectures with a resolution 
of ~100Î¼m. These free-standing, binder- and conductive additive-free LCO 
structures are integrated as cathodes into LIBs, and exhibit electrochemical 
capacity retention of 76% over 100 cycles at C/10. This facile approach to 
fabricating 3D LCO structures can be extended to other materials by tailoring 
the identity and stoichiometry of the metal salt solutions used, providing a 
versatile method for the fabrication of multicomponent metal oxides with complex 
3D architectures.
