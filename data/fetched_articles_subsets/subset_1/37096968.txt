CONTEXT: Hawthorn leaves are a kind of widely used medicinal plant in China. The 
major ingredient, hawthorn leaves flavonoids (HLF), have cardiotonic, 
cardioprotective, and vascular protective effects.
OBJECTIVE: The study evaluated the protective role of HLF in cardiac remodelling 
and the underlying mechanisms under simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading 
rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, 
HLF, HU (hindlimb unloading) and HU + HLF groups (n = 8). After HU and daily 
intragastric administration at the dose of 100 mg/kg/d for 8 weeks, cardiac 
function and structure were evaluated by biochemical indices and histopathology. 
We identified the main active compounds and mechanisms involved in the 
cardioprotective effects of HLF via bioinformatics and molecular docking 
analysis, and relative signalling pathway activity was verified by Western blot.
RESULTS: HLF treatment could reverse the HU-induced decline in LV-EF (HU, 55.13% 
± 0.98% vs. HU + HLF, 71.16% ± 5.08%), LV-FS (HU, 29.44% ± 0.67% vs. HU + HLF, 
41.62% ± 4.34%) and LV mass (HU, 667.99 ± 65.69 mg vs. HU + HLF, 
840.02 ± 73.00 mg). Furthermore, HLF treatment significantly increased NPRA 
expression by 135.39%, PKG by 51.27%, decreased PDE5A by 20.03%, NFATc1 by 
41.68% and Rcan1.4 by 54.22%.
CONCLUSIONS: HLF plays a protective effect on HU-induced cardiac remodelling by 
enhancing NPRA-cGMP-PKG pathway and suppressing the calcineurin-NFAT pathway, 
which provides a theoretical basis for use in clinical therapies.
