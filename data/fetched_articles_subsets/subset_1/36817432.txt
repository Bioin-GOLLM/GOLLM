Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in glioblastoma faces many 
challenges including insufficient CAR T cell abundance and antigen-negative 
tumor cells evading targeting. Unfortunately, preclinical studies evaluating CAR 
T cells in glioblastoma focus on tumor models that express a single antigen, use 
immunocompromised animals, and/or pre-treat with lymphodepleting agents. While 
lymphodepletion enhances CAR T cell efficacy, it diminishes the endogenous 
immune system that has the potential for tumor eradication. Here, we engineered 
CAR T cells to express IL7 and/or Flt3L in 50% EGFRvIII-positive and -negative 
orthotopic tumors pre-conditioned with non-lymphodepleting irradiation. IL7 and 
IL7 Flt3L CAR T cells increased intratumoral CAR T cell abundance seven days 
after treatment. IL7 co-expression with Flt3L modestly increased conventional 
dendritic cells as well as the CD103+XCR1+ population known to have migratory 
and antigen cross-presenting capabilities. Treatment with IL7 or IL7 Flt3L CAR T 
cells improved overall survival to 67% and 50%, respectively, compared to 9% 
survival with conventional or Flt3L CAR T cells. We concluded that CAR T cells 
modified to express IL7 enhanced CAR T cell abundance and improved overall 
survival in EGFRvIII heterogeneous tumors pre-conditioned with 
non-lymphodepleting irradiation. Potentially IL7 or IL7 Flt3L CAR T cells can 
provide new opportunities to combine CAR T cells with other immunotherapies for 
the treatment of glioblastoma.
