PURPOSE: To screen the myocilin (MYOC) and forkhead box protein C1 (FOXC1) genes 
for sequence variations in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG).
METHODS: Seventy five PCG patients were screened for MYOC variations and 54 
cases (negative or heterozygous for cytochrome P4501B1 mutations) for FOXC1 
mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; -126T>C, -83G>A, p.R76K, 
IVS2+35G>A, and p.Y347Y) were identified in MYOC and two sequence variations 
(GGC375ins and GGC447ins) in FOXC1. No pathogenic variations were identified in 
MYOC and FOXC1 in our patients.
CONCLUSIONS: MYOC and FOXC1 mutations are not involved in pathogenesis of 
primary congenital glaucoma in our patients. Thus, it is important to screen 
other loci for involvement in congenital glaucoma in cases which are negative or 
heterozygous for CYP1B1 mutations to have a better insight in to disease 
pathogenesis.
