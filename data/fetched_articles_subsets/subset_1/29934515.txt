Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia have been thought to be 
associated with periodontitis; however comprehensive histopathological 
localization of bacteria in affected human periodontal tissues is not well 
documented. In the present study, we examined formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
gingival and subgingival granulation tissues from 71 patients with chronic 
periodontitis and 11 patients with aggressive periodontitis, using 
immunohistochemistry with novel monoclonal antibodies specific to P. gingivalis 
or T. forsythia, together with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
for each bacterial DNA. Immunohistochemisty revealed both bacterial species 
extracellularly, as aggregates or within bacterial plaque, and intracellularly 
in stromal inflammatory cells, squamous epithelium, and capillary endothelium of 
granulation tissue. Combined analysis with the results from polymerase chain 
reaction suggested that localization and density of T. forsythia is closely 
associated with those of P. gingivalis, and that bacterial density is a factor 
responsible for the cell-invasiveness and tissue-invasiveness of these 
periodontal bacteria. Detection of these bacteria in the capillary endothelium 
in some samples suggested possible bacterial translocation into the systemic 
circulation from inflamed gingival and subgingival granulation tissues. 
Immunohistochemistry with the novel antibodies showed high specificity and 
sensitivity, and can be used to locate these periodontal bacteria in 
routinely-used formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissue sections from 
systemic locations.
