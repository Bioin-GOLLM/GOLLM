BACKGROUND: The aim of this longitudinal study was to assess with positron 
emission tomography (PET) the relationship between levels of inflammation and 
the loads of aggregated β-amyloid and tau at baseline and again after 2 years in 
prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Forty-three subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) had serial 
11C-PK11195 PET over 2 years to measure inflammation changes, and 11C-PiB PET to 
determine β-amyloid fibril load; 22 also had serial 18F-Flortaucipir PET to 
determine tau tangle load. Cortical surface statistical mapping was used to 
localise areas showing significant changes in tracer binding over time and to 
interrogate correlations between tracer binding of the tracers at baseline and 
after 2 years.
RESULTS: Those MCI subjects with high 11C-PiB uptake at baseline (classified as 
prodromal Alzheimer's disease) had raised inflammation levels which 
significantly declined across cortical regions over 2 years although their 
β-amyloid levels continued to rise. Those MCI cases who had low/normal 11C-PiB 
uptake at baseline but their levels then rose over 2 years were classified as 
prodromal AD with low Thal phase 1-2 amyloid deposition at baseline. They showed 
levels of cortical inflammation which correlated with their rising β-amyloid 
load. Those MCI cases with baseline low 11C-PiB uptake that remained stable were 
classified as non-AD, and they showed no correlated inflammation levels. 
Finally, MCI cases which showed both high 11C-PiB and 18F-Flortaucipir uptake at 
baseline (MCI due to AD) showed a further rise in their tau tangle load over 2 
years with a correlated rise in levels of inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our baseline and 2-year imaging findings are compatible with a 
biphasic trajectory of inflammation in Alzheimer's disease: MCI cases with low 
baseline but subsequently rising β-amyloid load show correlated levels of 
microglial activation which then later decline when the β-amyloid load 
approaches AD levels. Later, as tau tangles form in β-amyloid positive MCI cases 
with prodromal AD, the rising tau load is associated with higher levels of 
inflammation.
