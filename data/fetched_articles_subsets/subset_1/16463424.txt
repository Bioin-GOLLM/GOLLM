OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic periaortitis (CP) often show clinical and 
laboratory findings of a systemic autoimmune disorder. The aim of the present 
study was to investigate the role of the HLA system in CP.
METHODS: Low-resolution genotyping for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 loci and 
genotyping of TNFA(-238)A/G and TNFA(-308)A/G single nucleotide polymorphisms 
were performed in 35 consecutive patients with CP and 350 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The HLA-DRB1*03 allele frequency was strikingly higher in patients with 
CP than in controls (24.28% versus 9.14%; chi(2) = 15.50, P = 0.000084, 
corrected P [P(corr)] = 0.0012, odds ratio [OR] 3.187, 95% confidence interval 
[95% CI] 1.74-5.83); the HLA-B*08 allele frequency was also higher in patients 
than in controls (17.14% versus 6.28%; chi(2)=11.12, P = 0.0008, P(corr) = 
0.0269, OR 3.085, 95% CI 1.54-6.16). The A*01 allele frequency was significantly 
different (P = 0.0463), but the statistical significance was lost after 
correction for multiple testing (P(corr) = 0.5088). TNFA(-238)A allele and 
TNFA(-308)A allele frequencies were not significantly different (P = 0.512 and P 
= 0.445, respectively). Comparison of the main clinical and laboratory findings 
suggestive of a systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., acute-phase reactants, 
constitutional symptoms, other autoimmune diseases associated with CP) between 
the HLA-DRB1*03-positive and the HLA-DRB1*03-negative patients showed that the 
former group had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (P = 0.045) 
at disease onset, although this difference was not statistically significant 
after correction for multiple tests (P(corr) = 0.369).
CONCLUSION: The HLA system plays a role in susceptibility to CP. The strong 
association between CP and HLA-DRB1*03, an allele linked to a wide range of 
autoimmune conditions, further supports the view that CP may represent a 
clinical manifestation of an autoimmune disease.
