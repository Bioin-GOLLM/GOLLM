Physical contacts between distant loci contribute to regulate genome function. 
However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for settling and maintaining such 
interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the well-conserved 
interactions between heterochromatin loci. In budding yeast, the 32 telomeres 
cluster in 3-5 foci in exponentially growing cells. This clustering is 
functionally linked to the formation of heterochromatin in subtelomeric regions 
through the recruitment of the silencing SIR complex composed of Sir2/3/4. 
Combining microscopy and Hi-C on strains expressing different alleles of SIR3, 
we show that the binding of Sir3 directly promotes long-range contacts between 
distant regions, including the rDNA, telomeres, and internal Sir3-bound sites. 
Furthermore, we unveil a new property of Sir3 in promoting rDNA compaction. 
Finally, using a synthetic approach, we demonstrate that Sir3 can bond loci 
belonging to different chromosomes together, when targeted to these loci, 
independently of its interaction with its known partners (Rap1, Sir4), Sir2 
activity, or chromosome context. Altogether, these data suggest that Sir3 acts 
as a molecular bridge that stabilizes long-range interactions.
