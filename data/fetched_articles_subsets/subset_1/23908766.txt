Eukaryotes have two types of spliceosomes, comprised of either major (U1, U2, 
U4, U5, U6) or minor (U11, U12, U4atac, U6atac; <1%) snRNPs. The high 
conservation of minor introns, typically one amidst many major introns in 
several hundred genes, despite their poor splicing, has been a long-standing 
enigma. Here, we discovered that the low abundance minor spliceosome's catalytic 
snRNP, U6atac, is strikingly unstable (tÂ½<2 hr). We show that U6atac level 
depends on both RNA polymerases II and III and can be rapidly increased by cell 
stress-activated kinase p38MAPK, which stabilizes it, enhancing mRNA expression 
of hundreds of minor intron-containing genes that are otherwise suppressed by 
limiting U6atac. Furthermore, p38MAPK-dependent U6atac modulation can control 
minor intron-containing tumor suppressor PTEN expression and cytokine 
production. We propose that minor introns are embedded molecular switches 
regulated by U6atac abundance, providing a novel post-transcriptional gene 
expression mechanism and a rationale for the minor spliceosome's evolutionary 
conservation. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00780.001.
