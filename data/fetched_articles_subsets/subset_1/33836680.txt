BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is a vital component in cancer treatment. However, due 
to the complex genetic bases of cancer, a clear prediction index for efficacy 
has not been established. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is one of the essential 
factors that affect immunotherapeutic efficacies, but it has not been determined 
whether the mutation is associated with the survival of Skin Cutaneous Melanoma 
(SKCM) patients. This study aimed at evaluating the correlation between TMB and 
immune infiltration.
METHODS: Somatic mutation profiles (n = 467), transcriptome data (n = 471), and 
their clinical information (n = 447) of all SKCM samples were downloaded from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. For each sample, TMB was calculated as 
the number of variants per megabase. Based on K-M survival analysis, they were 
allocated into the high-TMB and low-TMB groups (the optimal cutoff was 
determined by the 'surv_cutpoint' algorithm of survival R package). Then, Gene 
ontology (GO) and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) were performed, with 
immune-associated biological pathways found to be significantly enriched in the 
low-TMB group. Therefore, immune genes that were differentially expressed 
between the two groups were evaluated in Cox regression to determine their 
prognostic values, and a four-gene TMB immune prognostic model (TMB-IP) was 
constructed.
RESULTS: Elevated TMB levels were associated with better survival outcomes in 
SKCM patients. Based on the cutoff value in OS analysis, they were divided into 
high-TMB and low-TMB groups. GSEA revealed that the low-TMB group was associated 
with immunity while intersection analysis revealed that there were 38 
differentially expressed immune-related genes between the two groups. Four 
TMB-associated immune genes were used to construct a TMB-IP model. The AUC of 
the ROC curve of this model reached a maximum of 0.75 (95%CI, 0.66-0.85) for OS 
outcomes. Validation in each clinical subgroup confirmed the efficacy of the 
model to distinguish between high and low TMB-IP score patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In SKCM patients, low TMB was associated with worse survival 
outcomes and enriched immune-associated pathways. The four TMB-associated immune 
genes model can effectively distinguish between high and low-risk patients.
