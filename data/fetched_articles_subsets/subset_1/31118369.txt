A 33-year-old woman presented with a productive cough from childhood. She had 
suffered from repeated bacterial pneumonia. Her clinical and imaging findings 
revealed chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis and situs inversus. We suspected 
primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and performed a bronchial mucosal biopsy. The 
ciliary beat pattern according to high-speed video microscopy was complete loss. 
Electron microscopic findings of cilia showed defect of outer dynein arm (ODA). 
A genetic examination detected compound heterozygous mutations of DNAH5 that 
encode ODA components. There are few reports of genetic mutation analyses in 
Japanese PCD patients. We herein report a PCD patient with DNAH5 mutations and 
review the related literature.
