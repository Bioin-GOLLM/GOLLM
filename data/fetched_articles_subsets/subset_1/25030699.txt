A key function of the cellular DNA damage response is to facilitate the bypass 
of replication fork-stalling DNA lesions. Template switch reactions allow such a 
bypass and involve the formation of DNA joint molecules (JMs) between sister 
chromatids. These JMs need to be resolved before cell division; however, the 
regulation of this process is only poorly understood. Here, we identify a 
regulatory mechanism in yeast that critically controls JM resolution by the 
Mus81-Mms4 endonuclease. Central to this regulation is a conserved complex 
comprising the scaffold proteins Dpb11 and Slx4 that is under stringent control. 
Cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Slx4 by Cdk1 promotes the Dpb11-Slx4 
interaction, while in mitosis, phosphorylation of Mms4 by Polo-like kinase Cdc5 
promotes the additional association of Mus81-Mms4 with the complex, thereby 
promoting JM resolution. Finally, the DNA damage checkpoint counteracts 
Mus81-Mms4 binding to the Dpb11-Slx4 complex. Thus, Dpb11-Slx4 integrates 
several cellular inputs and participates in the temporal program for activation 
of the JM-resolving nuclease Mus81.
