BACKGROUND: The Forkhead (FKH) transcription factor FOXM1 is a key regulator of 
the cell cycle and is overexpressed in most types of cancer. FOXM1, similar to 
other FKH factors, binds to a canonical FKH motif in vitro. However, genome-wide 
mapping studies in different cell lines have shown a lack of enrichment of the 
FKH motif, suggesting an alternative mode of chromatin recruitment. We have 
investigated the role of direct versus indirect DNA binding in FOXM1 recruitment 
by performing ChIP-seq with wild-type and DNA binding deficient FOXM1.
RESULTS: An in vitro fluorescence polarization assay identified point mutations 
in the DNA binding domain of FOXM1 that inhibit binding to a FKH consensus 
sequence. Cell lines expressing either wild-type or DNA binding deficient 
GFP-tagged FOXM1 were used for genome-wide mapping studies comparing the 
distribution of the DNA binding deficient protein to the wild-type. This shows 
that interaction of the FOXM1 DNA binding domain with target DNA is essential 
for recruitment. Moreover, analysis of the protein interactome of wild-type 
versus DNA binding deficient FOXM1 shows that the reduced recruitment is not due 
to inhibition of protein-protein interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: A functional DNA binding domain is essential for FOXM1 chromatin 
recruitment. Even in FOXM1 mutants with almost complete loss of binding, the 
protein-protein interactions and pattern of phosphorylation are largely 
unaffected. These results strongly support a model whereby FOXM1 is specifically 
recruited to chromatin through co-factor interactions by binding directly to 
non-canonical DNA sequences.
