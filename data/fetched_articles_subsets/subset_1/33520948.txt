A change of an aspartic acid to asparagine of Taq (Thermus aquaticus) DNA 
polymerase is a gain of function mutation that supports faster PCR: the 
extension times for PCR amplification can be 2-3 times shorter. Surprising 
results from negative controls led to the discovery of strand-displacement 
ability and reverse transcriptase activity of Taq D732N DNA polymerase. We 
demonstrate that the mutant enzyme can, by itself, catalyze RT-PCR, and RT-LAMP 
assays. Residue 732 is on the surface of the enzyme, not near the active site.
