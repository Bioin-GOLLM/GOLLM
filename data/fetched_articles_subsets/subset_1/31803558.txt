Scombroid poisoning, also known as histamine fish poisoning, typically occurs 
after eating dark meat fish. Higher levels of histidine, which is converted to 
histamine, causes anaphylaxis-like symptoms upon ingestion. There are few 
reported cases of scombroid in humans secondary to light meat fish. We present a 
case secondary to tilapia consumption.
