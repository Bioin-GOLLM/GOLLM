Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is a rare genetic disorder of bone, characterised 
by hypoplastic/aplastic clavicles, delayed closure of fontanelles and sutures of 
the cranium and dental abnormalities. We describe a novel frameshift pathogenic 
variation-c.470dupT (p.M157Ifs*4, NM_001024630) in the runt-related 
transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) gene-that adds to the spectrum of mutations in 
this gene. The current case also illustrates the clinical and radiological 
findings in an adult with CCD.
