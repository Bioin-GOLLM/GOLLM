We report a family with four girls with moderate to severe intellectual 
disability and epilepsy. Two girls showed regression in adolescence and died of 
presumed sudden unexpected death in epilepsy at 16 and 22 years. Whole exome 
sequencing identified a truncating pathogenic variant in IQSEC2 at 
NM_001111125.2: c.2679_2680insA, p.(D894fs*10), a recently identified cause of 
epileptic encephalopathy in females (MIM 300522). The IQSEC2 variant was 
identified in both surviving affected sisters but in neither parent. We describe 
the phenotypic spectrum associated with IQSEC2 variants, highlighting how IQSEC2 
is adding to a growing list of X-linked genes that have a female-specific 
phenotype typically associated with de novo mutations. This report illustrates 
the need for careful review of all whole exome data, incorporating all possible 
modes of inheritance including that suggested by the family history.
