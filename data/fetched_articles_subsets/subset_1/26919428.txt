Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), a key activator of inflammation, primes the 
NLRP3-inflammasome for activation by inducing pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 expression. 
NF-κB, however, also prevents excessive inflammation and restrains 
NLRP3-inflammasome activation through a poorly defined mechanism. We now show 
that NF-κB exerts its anti-inflammatory activity by inducing delayed 
accumulation of the autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1. External NLRP3-activating 
stimuli trigger a form of mitochondrial (mt) damage that is caspase-1- and 
NLRP3-independent and causes release of direct NLRP3-inflammasome activators, 
including mtDNA and mtROS. Damaged mitochondria undergo Parkin-dependent 
ubiquitin conjugation and are specifically recognized by p62, which induces 
their mitophagic clearance. Macrophage-specific p62 ablation causes pronounced 
accumulation of damaged mitochondria and excessive IL-1β-dependent inflammation, 
enhancing macrophage death. Therefore, the "NF-κB-p62-mitophagy" pathway is a 
macrophage-intrinsic regulatory loop through which NF-κB restrains its own 
inflammation-promoting activity and orchestrates a self-limiting host response 
that maintains homeostasis and favors tissue repair.
