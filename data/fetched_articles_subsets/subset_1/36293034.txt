Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) provides a liquid tumor microenvironment model 
that includes cancer cells and immune cells. However, the characteristics of 
tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells have not been investigated in detail. Here, 
we analyzed MPE samples taken from a patient with pancreatic cancer who received 
a dendritic cell vaccine targeting Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) antigen over the disease 
course (two points at MPE1st and 2nd, two months after MPE1st). Epithelial cell 
adhesion molecule (EpCAM)+ cancer cells (PD-L1- or T cell immunoglobulin 
mucin-3, TIM-3-), both PD-1 or TIM-3 positive CD8+ T cells, and 
CD14+CD68+CD163+TIM-3+ macrophages increased from the MPE1st to MPE2nd. The 
ratio of WT1-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (WT1-CTLs) to MPE CD8+ T cells and 
IFN-γ secretion of WT1-CTLs were reduced with disease progression. 
Coincidentally, the fraction of central memory T (TCM) of WT1-CTLs was 
decreased. On the other hand, CD8+ T cells in response to SMAD4P130L, which is 
homogeneously expressed in EpCAM+ cancer cells, were detected using in vitro 
expansion with the HLA-A*11:01 restrictive SVCVNLYH neoantigen. Furthermore, the 
CD8+ T cell response to SMAD4P130L was diminished following remarkably decreased 
numbers of CD8+ TCM in MPE samples. In conclusion, CD8+ T cells responding to 
WT1 or SMAD4P130L neoantigen expressed in EpCAM+ pancreatic cancer cells were 
detected in MPE. A tumor antigen-specific immune response would provide novel 
insight into the MPE microenvironment.
