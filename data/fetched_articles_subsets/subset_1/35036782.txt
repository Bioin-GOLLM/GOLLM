(Z)-N-Benzyl-2-{2,4-dioxo-5-(4-prop-2-yl-1-yloxyl)benzylidene)thiazolin-3-yl)}acetamide 
(SE415) is a novel aldose reductase inhibitor used in the management of diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and associated complications. Herein, the drug was solubilized 
(mole fraction solubility) in a "PEG 400 (polyethylene glycol 400) + water" 
mixture of various ratios at 298.15 K. We reported the preferential solvation of 
SE415 by PEG 400 using Kirkwood-Buff integrals, the thermodynamic functional 
parameter, in vitro dissolution, and GastroPlus-based predictions for in vivo 
performance. The result of Hansen solubility parameter analysis suggested PEG 
400 as a suitable solvent for SE415 solubilization at 298.0 K, followed by 
prediction of several physicochemical properties. In the preferential solvation 
study, the molar volume, Hildebrand solubility parameters, and the molecular 
radius of SE415 were estimated as 258.4 cm3·mol-1, 27.62 MPa1/2, and 0.468 nm, 
respectively, using Fedors' method. The inverse Kirkwood-Buff integrals 
indicated that the preferential solvation of SE415 by PEG 400 occurred in all 
studied ratios of the (PEG 400 + water) mixtures. The maximum value (δx 1,3 = 
1.21 × 10-2) of the preferential solvation of SE415 by PEG 400 was achieved at x 
1 = 0.15. Then, using GastroPlus software, the maximum dissolution, improved in 
vivo oral absorption, and high regional compartmental absorption (total 99.0%) 
of SE415 in humans were predicted. Finally, the solubility data were 
correlated/predicted using various cosolvency models with satisfactory results. 
Thus, the binary cosolvent system can be a promising approach for enhanced oral 
absorption in controlling DM and associated complications in humans.
