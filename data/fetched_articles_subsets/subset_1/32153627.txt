Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous 
system. GBM causes poor clinical outcome and high mortality rate, mainly due to 
the lack of effective targeted therapy and prognostic biomarkers. Here, we 
developed a user-friendly Online Survival analysis web server for GlioBlastoMa, 
abbreviated OSgbm, to assess the prognostic value of candidate genes. Currently, 
OSgbm contains 684 samples with transcriptome profiles and clinical information 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Chinese 
Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). The survival analysis results can be graphically 
presented by Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot with Hazard ratio (HR) and log-rank p value. 
As demonstration, the prognostic value of 51 previously reported survival 
associated biomarkers, such as PROM1 (HR = 2.4120, p = 0.0071) and CXCR4 (HR = 
1.5578, p < 0.001), were confirmed in OSgbm. In summary, OSgbm allows users to 
evaluate and develop prognostic biomarkers of GBM. The web server of OSgbm is 
available at http://bioinfo.henu.edu.cn/GBM/GBMList.jsp.
