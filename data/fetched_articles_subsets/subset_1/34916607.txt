Senescent cells in cancer tissue, including senescent fibroblasts and 
macrophages, have been reported to increase the malignant potency of cancer 
cells by secreting senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Otherwise, 
Senescence of tumor cells has been believed to inhibit tumor growth by halting 
the massive proliferation and increasing the chances of immune clearance. In 
particular, senescent tumor cells (STCs) have been thought that they rarely 
exist in carcinomas because oncogene-induced senescence needs to be overcome for 
protumorigenic cells to become malignant. However, recent studies have revealed 
that a considerable number of STCs are present in cancer tissue, even in 
metastatic sites. In fact, STCs are widely involved in cancer progression by 
leading to collective invasion and building a cytokine barrier to protect 
nonsenescent tumor cells from immune attack. Furthermore, therapy-induced STCs 
can induce tumor progression and recurrence by increasing stemness. However, 
obscure causative factors and their heterogeneity in various cancers make it 
difficult to establish the physiological role of STCs. Here, we summarize and 
review the current knowledge of the pathophysiology and role of STCs. We also 
outline the current status of therapeutic strategies for directly removing STCs 
or modulating the SASPs to maximize the positive functions of STCs while 
suppressing the negative functions.
