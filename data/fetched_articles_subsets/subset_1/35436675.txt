BACKGROUND: Encorafenib plus cetuximab is efficient in anti-EGFR-naïve patients 
with BRAFV600E mutated (BRAFm) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). No data are 
available concerning the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors associated with anti-EGFRs 
(B + E) in patients previously treated with an anti-EGFR agent.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected a series of patients with BRAFm mCRC 
treated with B + E after previous anti-EGFR treatment, in 14 centers. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from 
the start of treatment, and we reported objective response and disease control 
rates (ORR, DCR; RECIST V1.1).
RESULTS: Twenty-five BRAFm mCRC patients were enrolled. Prior to B + E 
treatment, 4/10/11 patients were treated with 1/2/> 2 previous treatment lines. 
Ten patients received previous panitumumab, 14 cetuximab, 1 both. Immediate 
progression with previous anti-EGFR was reported for 7 patients. Anti-BRAF was 
encorafenib for 21 patients, dabrafenib for 4 patients, with cetuximab for 24 
patients and panitumumab for 1 patient. ORR was 40% (10 patients) and DCR was 
80% (20 patients). Median PFS and OS were 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.01-7.95) and 
10.1 months (95% CI, 7.75-NR). DCR amongst patients with previous primary 
resistance to anti-EGFR (N = 7) was 100%. Two patients discontinued B + E due to 
drug-related adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS: Though in a limited retrospective series of patients, these results 
show the efficacy of the combination of anti-BRAF and anti-EGFRs in BRAFm mCRC 
patients previously treated with an anti-EGFR. The use of this combination 
should thus not be ruled out in this population with limited therapeutic 
options.
