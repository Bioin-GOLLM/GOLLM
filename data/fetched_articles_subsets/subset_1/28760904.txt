Moraxella catarrhalis causes respiratory infections. In this study, 
fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were selected in vitro to evaluate the 
mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance. Strains with reduced fluoroquinolone 
susceptibility were obtained by stepwise selection in levofloxacin, and 
fluoroquinolone targets gyr and par were sequenced. Six novel mutations in GyrA 
(D84Y, T594dup, and A722dup), GyrB (E479K and D439N), and ParE (Q395R) involved 
in M. catarrhalis resistance to fluoroquinolones were revealed.
