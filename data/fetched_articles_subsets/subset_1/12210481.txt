BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a significant public health problem in this 
country. Substantial data support a plausible role for androgens in the etiology 
of this disease. The human HSD17B3 gene encodes the testicular (or type III) 17 
beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes testosterone 
biosynthesis in men.
METHODS: We have investigated the G289S (glycine at codon 289 replaced by 
serine) polymorphism at the HSD17B3 locus as a candidate single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) for prostate cancer risk in constitutional DNA from 103 
Italian prostate cancer patients and 109 Italian disease-free centenarians to 
assess the role of this SNP in susceptibility to prostate cancer.
RESULTS: The G289S polymorphism confers a significant increase in risk for 
prostate cancer (odds ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-6.07) in our 
study population.
CONCLUSION: Our data are consistent with a plausible role of the G289S SNP in 
prostate cancer susceptibility. Therefore, the HSD17B3 gene may be a plausible 
candidate gene for prostate cancer risk.
