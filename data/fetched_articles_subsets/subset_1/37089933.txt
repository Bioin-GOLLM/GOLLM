Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignant tumor, surpassing lung cancer 
as the most frequent malignancy in women. Drug resistance, metastasis, and 
immune escape are the major factors affecting patient survival and represent a 
huge challenge in BC treatment in clinic. The cell- and subcellular 
organelle-targeting nanoparticles-mediated targeted BC therapy may be an 
effective modality for immune evasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. 
Nanocarriers, efficiently delivering small molecules and macromolecules, are 
used to target subcellular apparatuses with excellent targeting, controlled 
delivery, and fewer side effects. This study summarizes and critically analyzes 
the latest organic nanoparticle-mediated subcellular targeted therapeutic based 
on chemotherapy, gene therapy, immunotherapy, and combination therapy in detail, 
and discusses the challenges and opportunities of nanoparticle therapy.
