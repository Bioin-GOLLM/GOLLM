BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Genes encoding protein C anticoagulant pathways are 
candidates for atherothrombotic and other aging-related disorders.
METHODS: Using a tagSNP approach, and data from the Cardiovascular Health Study 
(CHS), we assessed associations of common polymorphisms of PROC, PROS1 and PROCR 
with: (i) plasma protein C, soluble protein C endothelial receptor (sEPCR) and 
protein S levels measured in a subsample of 336 participants at study entry; and 
(ii) risk of incident clinical outcomes [coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, 
and mortality] in 4547 participants during follow-up. Secondarily, we explored 
associations between plasma protein C, protein S and sEPCR levels and other 
candidate genes involved in thrombosis, inflammation, and aging.
RESULTS: The PROCR Ser219Gly polymorphism (rs867186) was strongly associated 
with higher sEPCR levels, explaining 75% of the phenotypic variation. The PROCR 
Ser219Gly variant was also associated with higher levels of circulating protein 
C antigen. An IL10 polymorphism was associated with higher free protein S 
levels. The minor alleles of PROC rs2069901 and PROS1 rs4857343 were weakly 
associated with lower protein C and free protein S levels, respectively. There 
was no association between PROCR Ser219Gly and risk of CHD, stroke, or 
mortality. The minor allele of another common PROCR tagSNP, rs2069948, was 
associated with lymphoid PROCR mRNA expression and with increased risk of 
incident stroke and all-cause mortality, and decreased healthy survival during 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A common PROCR variant may be associated with decreased healthy 
survival in older adults. Additional studies are warranted to establish the role 
of PROCR variants in ischemic and aging-related disorders.
