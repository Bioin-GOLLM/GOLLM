Since the start of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, children aged ≤ 12 years have always 
been defined as underrepresented in terms of SARS-CoV-2 infections' frequency 
and severity. By correlating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics with clinical and 
virological features in 612 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients aged ≤ 12 years, we 
demonstrated a sizeable circulation of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages over the 
four pandemic waves in paediatric population, sustained by local transmission 
chains. Age < 5 years, highest viral load, gamma and delta clades positively 
influence this local transmission. No correlations between COVID-19 
manifestations and lineages or transmission chains are seen, except for a 
negative correlation between B.1.1.7 and hospitalization.
