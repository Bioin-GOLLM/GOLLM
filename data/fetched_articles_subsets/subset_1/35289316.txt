Host defense and inflammation are regulated by the NF-κB essential modulator 
(NEMO), a scaffolding protein with a broad immune cell and tissue expression 
profile. Hypomorphic mutations in inhibitor of NF-κB kinase regulatory subunit 
gamma (IKBKG) encoding NEMO typically present with immunodeficiency. Here, we 
characterized a pediatric autoinflammatory syndrome in 3 unrelated male patients 
with distinct X-linked IKBKG germline mutations that led to overexpression of a 
NEMO protein isoform lacking the domain encoded by exon 5 (NEMO-Δex5). This 
isoform failed to associate with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and dermal 
fibroblasts from affected patients activated NF-κB in response to TNF but not 
TLR3 or RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) stimulation when isoform levels were high. By 
contrast, T cells, monocytes, and macrophages that expressed NEMO-Δex5 exhibited 
increased NF-κB activation and IFN production, and blood cells from these 
patients expressed a strong IFN and NF-κB transcriptional signature. Immune 
cells and TNF-stimulated dermal fibroblasts upregulated the inducible IKK 
protein (IKKi) that was stabilized by NEMO-Δex5, promoting type I IFN induction 
and antiviral responses. These data revealed how IKBKG mutations that lead to 
alternative splicing of skipping exon 5 cause a clinical phenotype we have named 
NEMO deleted exon 5 autoinflammatory syndrome (NDAS), distinct from the immune 
deficiency syndrome resulting from loss-of-function IKBKG mutations.
