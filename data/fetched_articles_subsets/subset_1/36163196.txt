ER-mitochondrial contact sites (EMCSs) are important for mitochondrial function. 
Here, we have identified a EMCS complex, comprising a family of uncharacterised 
mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, TRB1, TRB2, and the ER protein, VAP27-1. 
In Arabidopsis, there are three TraB family isoforms and the trb1/trb2 double 
mutant exhibits abnormal mitochondrial morphology, strong starch accumulation, 
and impaired energy metabolism, indicating that these proteins are essential for 
normal mitochondrial function. Moreover, TRB1 and TRB2 proteins also interact 
with ATG8 in order to regulate mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy). The 
turnover of depolarised mitochondria is significantly reduced in both trb1/trb2 
and VAP27 mutants (vap27-1,3,4,6) under mitochondrial stress conditions, with an 
increased population of dysfunctional mitochondria present in the cytoplasm. 
Consequently, plant recovery after stress is significantly perturbed, suggesting 
that TRB1-regulated mitophagy and ER-mitochondrial interaction are two closely 
related processes. Taken together, we ascribe a dual role to TraB family 
proteins which are component of the EMCS complex in eukaryotes, regulating both 
interaction of the mitochondria to the ER and mitophagy.
