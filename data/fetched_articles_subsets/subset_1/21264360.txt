OBJECTIVE: to examine the possible association of CCR2-V64I and MCP-1-2518A/G 
polymorphisms with generalised aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) in the Chinese 
population.
METHODS: one hundred and twenty-four GAgP patients and 94 healthy subjects were 
included in the study. A peripheral blood sample was obtained from each subject 
and genomic DNA was isolated. Gene polymorphisms of CCR2-V64I and MCP-1-2518A/G 
were analysed by standard polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay.
RESULTS: a possible combined effect of CCR2-V64I and MCP-1-2518A/G was observed 
in the female GAgP patients, as the odds ratio for VV genotype (CCR2) and G+ 
genotype ( MCP-1) was 0.2 (P = 0.023). Individuals carrying VV genotype and G+ 
genotype were at reduced risk for GAgP. A possible combined effect of genotype 
and smoking was observed in the male GAgP patients, as the odds ratio for VV 
genotype (CCR2) and smoking, or G+ genotype (MCP-1) and smoking were 7.4 (P = 
0.022) and 4.9 (P = 0.030), respectively.
CONCLUSION: the combined association of CCR2-V64I and MCP-1-2518A/G 
polymorphisms may play an important role in determining GAgP susceptibility in 
Chinese females. A possible combined effect of genotype and smoking on GAgP 
susceptibility was suggested in males.
