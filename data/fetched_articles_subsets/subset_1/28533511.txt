CD47 is an important 'marker of self' protein with multiple isoforms produced 
though alternative splicing that exhibit tissue-specific expression. Mature 
erythrocytes express CD47 isoform 2 only, with membrane stability of this 
version dependent on inclusion within the band 3 macrocomplex, via protein 4.2. 
At present a paucity of information exists regarding the associations and 
trafficking of the CD47 isoforms during erythropoiesis. We show that CD47 
isoform 2 is the predominant version maintained at the surface of expanding and 
terminally differentiating erythroblasts. CD47 isoforms 3 and 4 are expressed in 
all cell types tested except mature erythrocytes, but do not reach the plasma 
membrane in erythroblasts and are degraded by the orthochromatic stage of 
differentiation. To identify putative CD47 interactants, immunoprecipitation 
combined with Nano LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry was conducted on the 
erythroleukaemic K562 cell line, expanding and terminally differentiating 
primary erythroblasts and mature erythrocytes. Results indicate that prior to 
incorporation into the band 3 macrocomplex, CD47 associates with actin-binding 
proteins and we confirm that CD47 membrane stability is sensitive to actin 
disrupting drugs. Maintenance of CD47 at the cell surface was also influenced by 
dynamin, with sensitivity to dynamin disruption prolonged relative to that of 
actin during erythropoiesis.
