Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has raised serious concerns worldwide over the 
past 3 years. The severity and clinical course of COVID-19 depends on many 
factors (e.g., associated comorbidities, age, etc) and may have various clinical 
and imaging findings, which raises management concerns. Gut microbiota 
composition is known to influence respiratory disease, and respiratory viral 
infection can also influence gut microbiota. Gut and lung microbiota and their 
relationship (gut-lung axis) can act as modulators of inflammation. Modulating 
the intestinal microbiota, by improving its composition and diversity through 
nutraceutical agents, can have a positive impact in the prophylaxis/treatment of 
COVID-19.
