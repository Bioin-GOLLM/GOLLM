Cognitive impairments are closely related to synaptic loss in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Functional changes in synaptic contacts are reflected in dendritic 
spine morphology. Visualization of neurons for morphological studies in vivo is 
complicated by the fixed brain slice staining or expensive adeno-associated 
virus injections. We created a transgenic 5xFAD-M line of mice with 
AD-associated mutations and expressed GFP protein in single neurons of the 
brain. This mouse model of AD is a useful tool for the simplified visualization 
of the hippocampal neurons' morphology in vivo without additional staining 
manipulations. The progressive elimination of mushroom spines was demonstrated 
in 5xFAD-M mice between 4 and 5 months of age. Five-month-old 5xFAD-M male and 
female mice showed change both in the total density and the mushroom spines 
number compared to sex-matched control. We conclude 5xFAD-M mice can be a useful 
AD model for studying the mechanisms of synaptic pathology under 
neurodegenerative conditions and evaluating the effects of potential therapeutic 
agents on spine morphology as crucial aspect of memory loss in AD.
