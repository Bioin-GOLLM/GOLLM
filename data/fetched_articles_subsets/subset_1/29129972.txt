Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer in both men and women 
in the United States, resulting in over 55,000 deaths annually. Environmental 
and genetic factors influence the development of CRC, and inflammation is a 
critical hallmark of cancer that may arise from a variety of factors.
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: While patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a 
higher risk of developing CRC, sporadic CRCs may engender or be potentiated by 
inflammation as well. In this review, we focus on recent advances in basic and 
translational research utilizing murine models to understand the contribution of 
inflammatory signaling pathways to CRC.
RECENT FINDINGS: We discuss advances in the utility of three-dimensional 
enteroid/colonoid/tumoroid cultures to understand immune-epithelial interactions 
in CRC, as well as the potential for utilizing patient-derived tumoroids for 
personalized therapies.
SUMMARY: This review underscores the importance of understanding the complex 
molecular mechanisms underlying inflammation in sporadic CRC and highlights 
up-and-coming or new avenues for CRC biomarkers or therapies.
