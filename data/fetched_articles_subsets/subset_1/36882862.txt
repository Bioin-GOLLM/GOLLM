BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the interleukin-10 (IL10) gene have been linked to 
the severity of the patients infected with the viral infections. This study 
aimed to assess if the IL10 gene polymorphisms rs1800871, rs1800872, and 
rs1800896 were linked to coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) mortality in 
different severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants 
in the Iranian population.
METHODS: For genotyping IL10 rs1800871, rs1800872, and rs1800896, this study 
used the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
method in 1,734 recovered and 1,450 deceased patients.
RESULTS: The obtained finding indicated IL10 rs1800871 CC genotype in the Alpha 
variant and CT genotype in the Delta variant had a relationship with COVID-19 
mortality; however, there was no association between rs1800871 polymorphism and 
the Omicron BA.5 variant. The COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with IL10 
rs1800872 TT genotype in the Alpha and Omicron BA.5 variants and GT in the Alpha 
and Delta variants. The COVID-19 mortality rate was associated with IL10 
rs1800896 GG and AG genotypes in the Delta and Omicron BA.5; nevertheless, there 
was no association between rs1800896 polymorphism with the Alpha variant. 
According to the obtained data, the GTA haplotype was the most common of 
haplotype in different SARS-CoV-2 variants. The TCG haplotype was related to 
COVID-19 mortality in the Alpha, Delta and Omicron BA.5 variants.
CONCLUSION: The IL10 polymorphisms had an impact on COVID-19 infection, and 
these polymorphisms had different effects in various SARS-CoV-2 variants. To 
verify the obtained results, further studies should be conducted on various 
ethnic groups.
