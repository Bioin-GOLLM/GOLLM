Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder that 
predisposes individuals to developing tumors in many organs. There is 
significant phenotypic variability and genetic variants encountered within this 
syndrome, posing a considerable challenge to patient care. The lack of VHL 
variant data sharing paired with the absence of aggregated genotype-phenotype 
information results in an arduous process, when characterizing genetic variants 
and predicting patient prognosis. To address these gaps in knowledge, the 
Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) VHL Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) has 
been resolving a list of variants of uncertain significance within the VHL gene. 
Through community curation, we crowdsourced the laborious task of variant 
annotation by modifying the ClinGen Community Curation (C3)-developed Baseline 
Annotation protocol and annotating all published VHL cases with the reported 
genotype-phenotype information in Hypothes.is, an open-access web annotation 
tool. This process, incorporated into the ClinGen VCEP's workflow, will aid in 
their curation efforts. To facilitate the curation at all levels of genetics 
expertise, our team developed a 4-day biocuration training protocol and resource 
guide. To date, 91.3% of annotations have been completed by undergraduate and 
high-school students without formal academic genetics specialization. Here, we 
present our VHL-specific annotation protocol utilizing Hypothes.is, which offers 
a standardized method to present case-resolution data, and our biocuration 
training protocol, which can be adapted for other rare disease platforms. By 
facilitating training for community curation of VHL disease, we increased 
student engagement with clinical genetics while enhancing knowledge translation 
in the field of hereditary cancer. Database URL:
