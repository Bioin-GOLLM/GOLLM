The human concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (hCNT2) plays a major role in 
the intestinal absorption of naturally occurring nucleosides as well as some 
nucleoside analog drugs. To determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
in the promoter region of hCNT2 affect gene expression, we examined 
approximately 1 kb upstream the hCNT2 transcription start site. Ninety Chinese 
samples were screened and seven SNPs were identified: -115T>G, -146T>A, -264A>G, 
-564G>A, -861A>C, -880T>C and -906C>T. Based on these seven variants and their 
relative positions, eight haplotypes were identified using PHASE v2.1.1. Three 
naturally occurring haplotypes were cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector and 
transfected into HEK293 cells. Dual luciferase assay revealed that haplotype 4 
(GTAGACC) and 7 (GAGAACT) exhibited significantly lower expression levels 
compared to the published haplotype 1 (TTAGATC). Results from our in-vitro study 
showed that the hCNT2 promoter region haplotype may modulate gene expression and 
cause different drug responses.
