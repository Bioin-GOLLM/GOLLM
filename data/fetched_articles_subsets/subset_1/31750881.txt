Protein acetylation is an important contributor to cancer initiation. Histone 
deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) controls JAK2 translation and protein stability and has 
been implicated in JAK2-driven diseases best exemplified by myeloproliferative 
neoplasms (MPNs). By using novel classes of highly selective HDAC inhibitors and 
genetically deficient mouse models, we discovered that HDAC11 rather than HDAC6 
is necessary for the proliferation and survival of oncogenic JAK2-driven MPN 
cells and patient samples. Notably, HDAC11 is variably expressed in primitive 
stem cells and is expressed largely upon lineage commitment. Although Hdac11is 
dispensable for normal homeostatic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell 
differentiation based on chimeric bone marrow reconstitution, Hdac11 deficiency 
significantly reduced the abnormal megakaryocyte population, improved splenic 
architecture, reduced fibrosis, and increased survival in the MPLW515L-MPN mouse 
model during primary and secondary transplantation. Therefore, inhibitors of 
HDAC11 are an attractive therapy for treating patients with MPN. Although JAK2 
inhibitor therapy provides substantial clinical benefit in MPN patients, the 
identification of alternative therapeutic targets is needed to reverse MPN 
pathogenesis and control malignant hematopoiesis. This study establishes HDAC11 
as a unique type of target molecule that has therapeutic potential in MPN.
