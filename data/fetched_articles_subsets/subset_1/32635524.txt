Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play major roles in tumor initiation, progression, and 
resistance to cancer therapy. Several CSC markers have been studied in head and 
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), including the pluripotency factors NANOG, 
SOX2, and OCT4; however, their clinical significance is still unclear. NANOG, 
SOX2, and OCT4 expression was evaluated by immunochemistry in 348 
surgically-treated HNSCC, and correlated with clinicopathological parameters and 
patient outcomes. mRNA expression was further analyzed in 530 The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) HNSCC. NANOG protein expression was detected in 250 (72%) cases, 
more frequently in patients with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.003), and was an 
independent predictor of better survival in multivariate analysis. While OCT4 
expression was undetectable, SOX2 expression was observed in 105 (30%) cases, 
and strongly correlated with NANOG expression. Combined expression of both 
proteins showed the highest survival rates, and double-negative cases the worst 
survival. Strikingly, the impact of NANOG and SOX2 on outcome varied depending 
on tumor site and lymph node infiltration, specifically showing prognostic 
significance in pharyngeal tumors. Correlation between NANOG and SOX2 at mRNA 
and protein was specifically observed in node positive (N+) patients, and 
consistently correlated with better survival rates. According to our findings, 
NANOG protein expression is frequent in HNSCC, thereby emerging as an 
independent predictor of better prognosis in pharyngeal tumors. Moreover, this 
study uncovers a differential impact of NANOG and SOX2 expression on HNSCC 
prognosis, depending on tumor site and lymph node infiltration, which could 
facilitate high-risk patient stratification.
