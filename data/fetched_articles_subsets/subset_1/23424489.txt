In the title salt, C(12)H(11)N(2)O(2) (+)·C(7)H(5)O(6)S(-), the dihedral angle 
between the benzene and pyridine rings in the 4-(4-nitro-benz-yl)pyridinium 
cation is 82.7 (2)°. Within the anion there is an intramolecular 
hydroxy-O-H⋯O(carboxylic acid) bond. In the crystal, the cation forms a single 
N(+)-H⋯O(sulfonate) hydrogen bond with the anion. These cation-anion pairs 
inter-act through duplex anion carb-oxy-lic acid O-H⋯O(sulfonate) hydrogen 
bonds, giving a centrosymmetric cyclic association [graph set R(2) (2)(16)]. The 
crystals studied were non-merohedrally twinned.
