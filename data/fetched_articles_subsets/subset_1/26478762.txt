Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven powerful for 
comprehending the genetic architecture of complex traits, they are challenged by 
a high dimension of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as predictors, the 
presence of complex environmental factors, and longitudinal or functional 
natures of many complex traits or diseases. To address these challenges, we 
propose a high-dimensional varying-coefficient model for incorporating 
functional aspects of phenotypic traits into GWAS to formulate a so-called 
functional GWAS or fGWAS. Bayesian group lasso and the associated MCMC 
algorithms are developed to identify significant SNPs and estimate how they 
affect longitudinal traits through time-varying genetic actions. The model is 
generalized to analyze the genetic control of complex traits using 
subject-specific sparse longitudinal data. The statistical properties of the new 
model are investigated through simulation studies. We use the new model to 
analyze a real GWAS data set from the Framingham Heart Study, leading to the 
identification of several significant SNPs associated with age-specific changes 
of body mass index. The fGWAS model, equipped with Bayesian group lassso, will 
provide a useful tool for genetic and developmental analysis of complex traits 
or diseases.
