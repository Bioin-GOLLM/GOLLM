Mutational hotspots indicate selective pressure across a population of tumor 
samples, but their prevalence within and across cancer types is incompletely 
characterized. An approach to detect significantly mutated residues, rather than 
methods that identify recurrently mutated genes, may uncover new biologically 
and therapeutically relevant driver mutations. Here, we developed a statistical 
algorithm to identify recurrently mutated residues in tumor samples. We applied 
the algorithm to 11,119 human tumors, spanning 41 cancer types, and identified 
470 somatic substitution hotspots in 275 genes. We find that half of all human 
tumors possess one or more mutational hotspots with widespread lineage-, 
position- and mutant allele-specific differences, many of which are likely 
functional. In total, 243 hotspots were novel and appeared to affect a broad 
spectrum of molecular function, including hotspots at paralogous residues of 
Ras-related small GTPases RAC1 and RRAS2. Redefining hotspots at mutant amino 
acid resolution will help elucidate the allele-specific differences in their 
function and could have important therapeutic implications.
