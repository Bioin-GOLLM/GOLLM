STAT3 is an important transcription factor that regulates cell growth and 
proliferation by regulating gene transcription of a plethora of genes. This 
protein also has many roles in cancer progression and several tumors such as 
prostate, lung, breast, and intestine cancers that are characterized by strong 
STAT3-dependent transcriptional activity. This protein is post-translationally 
modified in different ways according to cellular context and stimulus, and the 
same post-translational modification can have opposite effects in different 
cellular models. In this review, we describe the studies performed on the main 
modifications affecting the activity of STAT3: phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 
and serine 727; acetylation of lysine 49, 87, 601, 615, 631, 685, 707, and 709; 
and methylation of lysine 49, 140, and 180. The extensive results obtained by 
different studies demonstrate that post-translational modifications drastically 
change STAT3 activities and that we need further analysis to properly elucidate 
all the functions of this multifaceted transcription factor.
