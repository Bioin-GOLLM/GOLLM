PURPOSE: To describe phenotype and genotype characteristics of age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) in Japanese patients.
DESIGN: A case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 550 case-control samples composed of 408 consecutive 
AMD cases and 142 controls.
METHODS: Clinical information assessing age, gender, affected eyes, fundus 
features, and fluorescein/indocyanine green angiograms were systematically 
evaluated. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs800292, rs1061170, 
rs1410996, rs2274700) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene, 1 SNP (rs11200638) 
in the high-temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1) gene, 3 SNPs (rs699947, 
rs1570360, rs2010963) in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene, and 
4 SNPs (rs12150053, rs12948385, rs9913583, rs1136287) in the pigment 
epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) gene were assessed using TaqMan technology.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical phenotype information and genotypes of CFH, 
HTRA1, VEGF, and PEDF polymorphisms.
RESULTS: Of Japanese patients with neovascular AMD (nAMD), 219 (58.7%) had 
typical nAMD and 154 (41.3%) had polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). The 
frequency of bilateral exudative involvement was similar between typical nAMD 
(15.5%) and PCV (13.6%) (P = 0.613). Significant soft drusen were observed in 
the fellow eyes of 88 (47.6%) of 185 patients with unilateral typical nAMD and 
in 25 (18.8%) of 133 patients with unilateral PCV (P = 1.24x10(-7)). A serous 
pigment epithelium detachment was seen in 55 (25.1%) of 219 patients with 
typical nAMD and in 64 (41.6%) of 154 patients with PCV. A significant 
association was noted in CFH-rs800292, CFH-rs1410996, CFH-rs2274700, and 
HTRA1-rs11200638 with AMD development (P = 2.36x10(-5), 7.18x10(-5), 
7.18x10(-5), 2.70x10(-7), respectively; population attributable risk = 57.3%, 
57.8%, 57.8%, and 58.9%, respectively). We estimated the highest-risk group to 
have an approximately 70-fold greater risk of nAMD compared with the lowest-risk 
group when analyzing a combination of 4 SNPs in the CFH and HTRA1 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The Japanese AMD phenotype is characterized by a higher frequency 
of PCV, male predominance, and lower frequency of bilateral presentation 
compared with Caucasian AMD. Genotype analyses demonstrate a significant 
population attributable risk for SNPs in the CFH and HTRA1 genes and demonstrate 
joint effects for both genes. Gene variants in both CFH and HTRA1 contribute 
significantly to the AMD phenotype in a Japanese population.
