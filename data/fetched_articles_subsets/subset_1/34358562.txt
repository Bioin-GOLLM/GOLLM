Protein acetylation is a reversible posttranslational modification, which is 
regulated by lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and lysine deacetyltransferase 
(KDAC). Although protein acetylation has been shown to regulate synaptic 
plasticity, this was mainly for histone protein acetylation. The function and 
regulation of nonhistone protein acetylation in synaptic plasticity and learning 
remain largely unknown. Calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor, plays 
critical roles in synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP). 
During LTP induction, activation of NMDA receptor triggers Ca2+ influx, and the 
Ca2+ binds with CaM and activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 
IIα (CaMKIIα). In our previous study, we demonstrated that acetylation of CaM 
was important for synaptic plasticity and fear learning in mice. However, the 
KAT responsible for CaM acetylation is currently unknown. Here, following an 
HEK293 cell-based screen of candidate KATs, steroid receptor coactivator 3 
(SRC3) is identified as the most active KAT for CaM. We further demonstrate that 
SRC3 interacts with and acetylates CaM in a Ca2+ and NMDA receptor-dependent 
manner. We also show that pharmacological inhibition or genetic downregulation 
of SRC3 impairs CaM acetylation, synaptic plasticity, and contextual fear 
learning in mice. Moreover, the effects of SRC3 inhibition on synaptic 
plasticity and fear learning could be rescued by 3KQ-CaM, a mutant form of CaM, 
which mimics acetylation. Together, these observations demonstrate that SRC3 
acetylates CaM and regulates synaptic plasticity and learning in mice.
