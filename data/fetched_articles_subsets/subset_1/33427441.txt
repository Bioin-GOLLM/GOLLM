Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is by far the most commonly used method of 
nucleic acid amplification and has likewise been employed for a plethora of 
diagnostic purposes. Nonetheless, multiplexed PCR-based detection schemes have 
hitherto been largely limited by technical challenges associated with 
nonspecific interactions and other limitations inherent to traditional 
fluorescence-based assays. Here, we describe a novel strategy for multiplexed 
PCR-based analysis called Ligation-eNabled fluorescence-Coding PCR (LiNC PCR) 
that exponentially enhances the multiplexing capability of standard 
fluorescence-based PCR assays. The technique relies upon a simple, preliminary 
ligation reaction in which target DNA sequences are converted to PCR template 
molecules with distinct endpoint fluorescence signatures. Universal TaqMan 
probes are used to create target-specific multicolor fluorescence signals that 
can be readily decoded to identify amplified targets of interest. We demonstrate 
the LiNC PCR technique by implementing a two-color-based assay for detection of 
10 ovarian cancer epigenetic biomarkers at analytical sensitivities as low as 60 
template molecules with no detectable target cross-talk. Overall, LiNC PCR 
provides a simple and inexpensive method for achieving high-dimensional 
multiplexing that can be implemented in manifold molecular diagnostic 
applications.
