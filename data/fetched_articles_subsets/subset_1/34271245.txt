OBJECTIVE: To present a cohort of 8 males and perform a systematic review of all 
published cases with a single copy of MECP2 carrying a pathogenic variant.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records of males with a single copy of MECP2 
carrying a pathogenic variant. We searched in Medline (Pubmed) and Embase to 
collect all articles which included well-characterized males with a single copy 
of MECP2 carrying a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in MECP2 
(1999-2020).
RESULTS: The literature search yielded a total of 3,185 publications, of which 
58 were included in our systematic review. We were able to collect information 
on 27 published patients with severe neonatal encephalopathy, 47 individuals 
with isolated or familial mental retardation X-linked 13 (XLMR13), as well as 24 
individuals with isolated or familial Pyramidal signs, parkinsonism, and 
macroorchidism (PPM-X). In our cohort, we met eight individuals aged 4 to 
19-year-old at the last evaluation. Three MECP2-associated phenotypes were seen 
in male carriers of a single copy of the gene: severe neonatal encephalopathy 
(n = 5); X-linked intellectual deficiency 13 (n = 2); and pyramidal signs, 
parkinsonism, and macroorchidism (PPM-X) (n = 1). Two novel de novo variants 
[p.(Gly252Argfs∗7) and p.(Tyr132Cys)] were detected.
CONCLUSION: In males, the MECP2 pathogenic variants can be associated with 
different phenotypes, including neonatal severe encephalopathy, intellectual 
deficiency, or late-onset parkinsonism and spasticity. The typical RS phenotype 
is not expected in males, except in those with Klinefelter syndrome or somatic 
mosaicism for MECP2.
