The mol-ecule of title compound, C(11)H(10)ClNO, is close to being planar (r.m.s 
deviation for the non-H atoms = 0.017 Å). In the crystal, mol-ecules inter-act 
by way of O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, generating C(2) chains propagating in [010]. The 
crystal structure is consolidated by C-H⋯π inter-actions and aromatic π-π 
stacking inter-actions [centroid-centroid distance = 3.661 (2) Å].
