Pathogenic sequence changes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are one of the most 
common causes of genetic hearing loss. We report an infant with palmoplantar 
hyperkeratosis, extrapalmoplantar cutaneous features and mitochondrial 
sensorineural hearing loss caused by the previously reported pathogenic 
NC_012920:m.7445A > G sequence change in the mitochondrial gene COX1 (COX1, 
MT-CO1). Next generation sequencing- based technology was key for the diagnosis 
and management of this patient.
