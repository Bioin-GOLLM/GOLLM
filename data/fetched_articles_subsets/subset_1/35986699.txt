BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory, pruritic skin 
disease. The Janus kinase (JAK) pathway is a treatment target.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of topical cream 
brepocitinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)/JAK1 inhibitor, in 
participants with mild-to-moderate AD.
METHODS: In this phase IIb, double-blind, dose-ranging study, participants were 
randomized to receive one of eight treatments for 6 weeks: brepocitinib 0·1% 
once daily (QD), 0·3% QD or twice daily (BID), 1·0% QD or BID, 3·0% QD, or 
vehicle QD or BID. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline 
in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score at week 6. Adverse 
events (AEs) were monitored.
RESULTS: Overall, 292 participants were enrolled and randomized. The 
brepocitinib 1% QD and 1% BID groups achieved statistically significantly 
greater (with multiplicity-adjusted P < 0·05 due to Hochberg's step-up method) 
percentage reductions from baseline in EASI total score at week 6 [least squares 
mean (90% confidence interval, CI): QD: -70·1 (-82·1 to -58·0); BID: -75·0 
(-83·8 to -66·2)] compared with respective vehicle [QD: -44·4 (-57·3 to -31·6); 
BID: -47·6 (-57·5 to -37·7)]. There was not a dose-dependent trend in AE 
frequency, and there were no serious AEs or deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical brepocitinib is effective and well tolerated in 
participants with mild-to-moderate AD. What is already known about this topic? 
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are in development for treatment of atopic 
dermatitis (AD). The tyrosine kinase 2 and JAK 1 inhibition by brepocitinib may 
bring a new profile for topical JAK inhibitors for treatment of mild-to-moderate 
AD. What does this study add? Topical brepocitinib can provide rapid, effective 
symptom reduction, and could offer a novel alternative to current topical 
treatments for mild-to-moderate AD.
