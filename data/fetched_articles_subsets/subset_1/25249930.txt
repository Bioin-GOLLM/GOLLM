Lactate is a versatile metabolite with important roles in modulation of brain 
glucose utilization rate (CMRglc), diagnosis of brain-injured patients, redox- 
and receptor-mediated signaling, memory, and alteration of gene transcription. 
Neurons and astrocytes release and accumulate lactate using equilibrative 
monocarboxylate transporters that carry out net transmembrane transport of 
lactate only until intra- and extracellular levels reach equilibrium. Astrocytes 
have much faster lactate uptake than neurons and shuttle more lactate among gap 
junction-coupled astrocytes than to nearby neurons. Lactate diffusion within 
syncytia can provide precursors for oxidative metabolism and glutamate synthesis 
and facilitate its release from endfeet to perivascular space to stimulate blood 
flow. Lactate efflux from brain during activation underlies the large 
underestimation of CMRglc with labeled glucose and fall in CMRO2/CMRglc ratio. 
Receptor-mediated effects of lactate on locus coeruleus neurons include 
noradrenaline release in cerebral cortex and c-AMP-mediated stimulation of 
astrocytic gap junctional coupling, thereby enhancing its dispersal and release 
from brain. Lactate transport is essential for its multifunctional roles.
