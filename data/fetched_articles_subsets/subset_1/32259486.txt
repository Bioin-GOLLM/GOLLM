During embryonic and postnatal development, organs and tissues grow steadily to 
achieve their final size at the end of puberty. However, little is known about 
the cellular dynamics that mediate postnatal growth. By combining in vivo clonal 
lineage tracing, proliferation kinetics, single-cell transcriptomics, and 
in vitro micro-pattern experiments, we resolved the cellular dynamics taking 
place during postnatal skin epidermis expansion. Our data revealed that 
harmonious growth is engineered by a single population of developmental 
progenitors presenting a fixed fate imbalance of self-renewing divisions with an 
ever-decreasing proliferation rate. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that 
epidermal developmental progenitors form a more uniform population compared with 
adult stem and progenitor cells. Finally, we found that the spatial pattern of 
cell division orientation is dictated locally by the underlying collagen fiber 
orientation. Our results uncover a simple design principle of organ growth where 
progenitors and differentiated cells expand in harmony with their surrounding 
tissues.
