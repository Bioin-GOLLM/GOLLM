In high-yielding dairy cows, the rapidly increasing milk production after 
parturition can result in a negative nutrient balance, since feed intake is 
insufficient to cover the needs for lactation. Mobilizing body reserves, mainly 
adipose tissue (AT), might affect steroid metabolism. We hypothesized, that cows 
differing in the extent of periparturient lipomobilization, will have divergent 
steroid profiles measured in serum and subcutaneous (sc)AT by a targeted 
metabolomics approach and steroidogenic enzyme profiles in scAT and liver. 
Fifteen weeks antepartum, 38 multiparous Holstein cows were allocated to a high 
(HBCS) or normal body condition (NBCS) group fed differently until week 7 
antepartum to either increase (HBCS BCS: 3.8 ± 0.1 and BFT: 2.0 ± 0.1 cm; 
mean ± SEM) or maintain BCS (NBCS BCS: 3.0 ± 0.1 and BFT: 0.9 ± 0.1 cm). Blood 
samples, liver, and scAT biopsies were collected at week -7, 1, 3, and 12 
relative to parturition. Greater serum concentrations of progesterone, 
androsterone, and aldosterone in HBCS compared to NBCS cows after parturition, 
might be attributed to the increased mobilization of AT. Greater glucocorticoid 
concentrations in scAT after parturition in NBCS cows might either influence 
local lipogenesis by differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes 
and/or inflammatory response.
