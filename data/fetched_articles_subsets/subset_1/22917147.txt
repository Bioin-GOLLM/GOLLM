Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is estimated to reach epidemic 
proportions by the year 2030. Given the limited accuracy of current AD clinical 
diagnosis, biomarkers of AD pathologies are currently being sought. Reductions 
in cerebrospinal fluid levels of β-amyloid 42 (a marker of amyloid plaques) and 
elevations in tau species (markers of neurofibrillary tangles and/or 
neurodegeneration) are well-established as biomarkers useful for AD diagnosis 
and prognosis. However, novel markers for other features of AD pathophysiology 
(e.g., β-amyloid processing, neuroinflammation and neuronal stress/dysfunction) 
and for other non-AD dementias are required to improve the accuracy of AD 
disease diagnosis, prognosis, staging and therapeutic monitoring (theragnosis). 
This article discusses the potential of several promising novel cerebrospinal 
fluid analytes, highlights the next steps critical for advancement in the field, 
and provides a prediction on how the field may evolve in 5-10 years.
