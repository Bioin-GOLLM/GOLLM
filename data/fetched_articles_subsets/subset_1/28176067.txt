The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays by degradation of angiotensin I 
and bradykinin, an important role in modulations of smooth muscle proliferation 
and vascular tone. Typical plasma levels of ACE accompany the I/D polymorphism; 
however, a controversy exists as to whether the DD genotype of the ACE 
polymorphism affects the risk for the development of coronary heart disease 
(CHD). We compared the I/D polymorphism in 171 Slovenian CHD patients that were 
younger man 55 years with 134 healthy control individuals. The DD genotype is 
associated with a 2.3 - fold increase in the risk for CHD.
