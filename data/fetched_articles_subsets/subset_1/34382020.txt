This protocol describes the isolation and culturing of primary neural stem cells 
(NSCs) from the adult mouse hippocampus, followed by the experimental approach 
for fluorescence loss in photobleaching assays, previously used to characterize 
the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane diffusion barrier. The 
assay described here can be used to study live asymmetry in the ER membrane or 
other organelles that is established in dividing NSCs. For complete details on 
the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Clay et al. (2014); bin 
Imtiaz et al. (2021); Lee et al. (2016); Luedeke et al. (2005); Moore et al. 
(2015); Shcheprova et al. (2008).
