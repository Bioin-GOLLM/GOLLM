Lycium ruthenicum, Known as a traditional medicinal plant in China, is 
distributed in the arid and semiarid areas of northwest China. In this study, we 
assembled the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of L. ruthenicum using data from 
high-throughput Illumina sequencing. The L. ruthenicum cp genome is 154,979 bp 
in size and includes two inverted repeat regions of 25,395 bp each, which is 
separated by a large single copy region of 85,984 bp and a small single copy 
region of 18,205 bp. A total of 132 genes were predicted, including 37 tRNA, 8 
rRNA, and 86 protein-coding genes. In addition, 9 PCG genes possess a single 
intron, 74 PCG genes no intron, and 3 other genes harbor two introns. 6 tRNA 
genes harbor a single intron. Phylogenetic analysis placed L. ruthenicum within 
the Solanaceae.
