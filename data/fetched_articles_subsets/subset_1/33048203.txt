BACKGROUND: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare, 
complement-mediated disease associated with poor outcomes if untreated. 
Ravulizumab, a long-acting C5 inhibitor developed through minimal, targeted 
modifications to eculizumab was recently approved for the treatment of aHUS. 
Here, we report outcomes from a pediatric patient cohort from the ravulizumab 
clinical trial (NCT03131219) who were switched from chronic eculizumab to 
ravulizumab treatment.
METHODS: Ten patients received a loading dose of ravulizumab on Day 1, followed 
by maintenance doses administered initially on Day 15, and then, every 4-8 weeks 
thereafter, depending on body weight. All patients completed the initial 
evaluation period of 26 weeks and entered the extension period.
RESULTS: No patients required dialysis at any point throughout the study. The 
median estimated glomerular filtration rate values remained stable during the 
trial: 99.8 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline, 93.5 mL/min/1.73m2 at 26 weeks, and 104 
mL/min/1.73m2 at 52 weeks. At last available follow-up, all patients were in the 
same chronic kidney disease stage as recorded at baseline. Hematologic variables 
(platelets, lactate dehydrogenase, and hemoglobin) also remained stable 
throughout the initial evaluation period and up to the last available follow-up. 
All patients experienced adverse events; the most common were upper respiratory 
tract infection (40%) and oropharyngeal pain (30%). There were no meningococcal 
infections reported, no deaths occurred, and no patients discontinued during the 
study.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, treatment with ravulizumab in pediatric patients with aHUS 
who were previously treated with eculizumab resulted in stable kidney and 
hematologic parameters, with no unexpected safety concerns when administered 
every 4-8 weeks.
