Identification of the precise molecular pathways involved in oncogene-induced 
transformation may help us gain a better understanding of tumor initiation and 
promotion. Here, we demonstrate that SOX2+ foregut epithelial cells are prone to 
oncogenic transformation upon mutagenic insults, such as KrasG12D and p53 
deletion. GFP-based lineage-tracing experiments indicate that SOX2+ cells are 
the cells-of-origin of esophagus and stomach hyperplasia. Our observations 
indicate distinct roles for oncogenic KRAS mutation and P53 deletion. p53 
homozygous deletion is required for the acquisition of an invasive potential, 
and KrasG12D expression, but not p53 deletion, suffices for tumor formation. 
Global gene expression analysis reveals secreting factors upregulated in the 
hyperplasia induced by oncogenic KRAS and highlights a crucial role for the 
CXCR2 pathway in driving hyperplasia. Collectively, the array of genetic models 
presented here demonstrate that stratified epithelial cells are susceptible to 
oncogenic insults, which may lead to a better understanding of tumor initiation 
and aid in the design of new cancer therapeutics.
