The three-dimensional structure of the E165D mutant of the glycolytic enzyme 
yeast triosephosphate isomerase has been determined by X-ray diffraction at a 
nominal resolution of 2 A. For crystallization, the mutant enzyme was complexed 
with the tight-binding intermediate analog, phosphoglycolohydroxamate. 
Comparison with the structure of the wild-type enzyme reveals that, as 
originally intended, replacement of the catalytic base Glu-165 with the shorter 
side chain of aspartic acid has increased the distance between the base and the 
intermediate analog by 1 A. In addition, the catalytic base is oriented in the 
E165D structure so as to use the anti orbital of the carboxylate for proton 
abstraction; in the structure of the wild-type enzyme, the syn orbital is 
oriented for this purpose. It has been hypothesized that the 1000-fold loss in 
catalytic activity for this mutant triosephosphate isomerase is due either to 
the use of the less basic anti orbital for proton transfer or to the greater 
distance between the base and the substrate. The structure of yeast E165D 
triosephosphate isomerase suggests that both distance and orientation factors 
contribute to the loss of activity in the mutant enzyme and, therefore, that 
both factors contribute to the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type enzyme.
