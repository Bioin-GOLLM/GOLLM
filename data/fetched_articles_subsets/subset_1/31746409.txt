Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common malignant gynecological tumors 
in women. The main treatments for EC (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy) produce significant side effects. Thus, it is urgent to identify 
promising therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. CACNA2D3, as a member of 
the calcium channel regulatory α2δ subunit family, is reported to exert a tumor 
suppressive effect in numerous cancers. However, the function of CACNA2D3 in EC 
is not well known. In the present study, CACNA2D3 was lowly expressed in EC 
tissues and cells. The overexpression of CACNA2D3 via lentiviral particle 
injection significantly blocked the tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model. 
In vitro, the overexpression of CACNA2D3 markedly inhibited cell proliferation 
and migration, and promoted cell apoptosis and calcium influx. These data 
revealed that CACNA2D3 functions as a tumor suppressor in EC. It was also 
revealed that the addition of progesterone (P4) blocked tumor growth in 
Ishikawa‑injected nude mice. P4 induced the expression of CACNA2D3 in vivo and 
in vitro, and the silencing of CACNA2D3 affected P4‑inhibited cell proliferation 
and P4‑induced cell apoptosis and calcium influx. In Ishikawa cells, P4 enhanced 
the expression of phosphorylated (p)‑p38 MAPK and PTEN, but blocked the levels 
of p‑PI3K and p‑AKT. The knockdown of CACNA2D3 blocked the function of P4. These 
data revealed that P4 promoted cell apoptosis via the activation of the 
CACNA2D3/Ca2+/p38 MAPK pathway, and blocked cell proliferation via suppression 
of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Collectively, these findings indicated the antitumor 
role of CACNA2D3 in EC, and revealed the mechanism of P4 inhibition of EC 
progression, which provided a new target for EC therapy and new evidence for P4 
in EC therapy.
