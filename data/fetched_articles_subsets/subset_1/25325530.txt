Mechanical manipulation of DNA by forced extension can lead double-stranded DNA 
(dsDNA) to structurally transform from a helical form to a linear zipper-like 
form. By employing classical molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical 
nonequilibrium Green's function-based transport simulations, we show the ability 
of graphene nanopores to discern different dsDNA conformations, in a helical to 
zipper transition, using transverse electronic conductance. In particular, 
conductance oscillations due to helical dsDNA vanish as dsDNA extends from a 
helical form to a zipper form while it is transported through the nanopore. The 
predicted ability to detect conformational changes in dsDNA via transverse 
electronic conductance can widen the potential use of graphene-based nanosensors 
for DNA detection.
