Sickle cell disease (SCD), considered the most common monogenic disease 
worldwide, is a severe hemoglobin disorder. Although the genetic and molecular 
bases have long been characterized, the pathophysiology remains incompletely 
elucidated and therapeutic options are limited. It has been increasingly 
suggested that innate immune cells, including monocytes, neutrophils, invariant 
natural killer T cells, platelets and mast cells, have a role in promoting 
inflammation, adhesion and pain in SCD. Here we provide a thorough review of the 
involvement of these novel, major protagonists in SCD pathophysiology, 
highlighting recent evidence for innovative therapeutic perspectives.
