Pediatric nephrolithiasis (NL) or Kidney stone disease (KSD) is an untethered 
topic in Asian population. In Western countries, the annual incidence of 
paediatric NL is around 6-10%. Here, we present data from West Bengal, India, on 
lower age (LA, 0-20 years) NL and its prevalence for the first time. To discover 
the mutations associated with KSD, twenty-four (18 + 6) rare LA-NL patients were 
selected for Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing, respectively. 
It was found that GRHPR c. 494G>A mutation (MZ826703) is predominant in our 
study cohort. This specific homozygous mutation is functionally studied for the 
first time directly from human peripheral mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples. Using 
expression study with biochemical activity and computational analysis we assumed 
that the mutation is pathogenic with loss of function. Moreover, three genes, 
AGXT, HOGA1 and GRHPR with Novel variants known to cause hyperoxaluria were 
found frequently in the study cohort. Our study analyses the genes and 
variations that cause LA-NL, as well as the molecular function of the GRHPR 
mutation, which may serve as a clinical marker in the population of West Bengal, 
Eastern India.
