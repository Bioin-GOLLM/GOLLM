Approximately, 1% of the genes in eukaryotic genomes encode for helicases, which 
make the number of helicases expressed in the cell considerably high. Helicases 
are motor proteins that participate in many central aspects of the nuclear and 
mitochondrial genomes, and based on their helicase motif conservation, they are 
divided into different helicase families. The Pif1 family of helicases is an 
evolutionarily conserved helicase family that is associated with familial breast 
cancer in humans. The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pfh1 helicase belongs to the 
Pif1 helicase family and is a multi-tasking helicase that is important for 
replication fork progression through natural fork barriers, for G-quadruplex 
unwinding, and for Okazaki fragment maturation, and these activities are 
potentially shared by the human Pif1 helicase. This review discusses the known 
functions of the Pfh1 helicase, the study of which has led to a better 
understanding of nucleic acid metabolism in eukaryotes.
