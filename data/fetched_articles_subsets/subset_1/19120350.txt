Recurrent, prognostically significant chromosomal abnormalities occur in 
approximately 75% of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), but only 
infrequently in children with Down syndrome (DS) and ALL. Recently, novel 
somatic activating mutations in the gene Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) were reported in 
18% of DS ALL. Here we report identification and clinical correlates of JAK2 
mutations in an independent cohort. JAK2 activating mutations occurred in 10/53 
DS ALL cases (18.9%). Mutations were overrepresented in males (P < 0.03), 
occurred once in association with high hyperdiploidy and were not significantly 
correlated with age, initial white blood count, or event-free survival. Our 
results confirm the significance of JAK-STAT pathway activation in DS ALL.
