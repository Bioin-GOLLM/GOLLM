In recent years, the field of venous thromboembolism has undergone numerous 
innovations, starting from the recent discoveries on the role of biomarkers, 
passing through the role of metabolomics in expanding our knowledge on 
pathogenic mechanisms, which have opened up new therapeutic targets. A variety 
of studies have contributed to characterizing the metabolic phenotype that 
occurs in venous thromboembolism, identifying numerous pathways that are altered 
in this setting. Among these pathways are the metabolism of carnitine, 
tryptophan, purine, and fatty acids. Furthermore, new evidence has emerged with 
the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Hypercoagulability phenomena induced by this viral 
infection appear to be related to altered von Willebrand factor activity, 
alteration of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and dysregulation of 
both innate and adaptive immunity. This is the first literature review that 
brings together the most recent evidence regarding biomarkers, metabolomics, and 
COVID-19 in the field of venous thromboembolism, while also mentioning current 
therapeutic protocols.
