Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is one of the leading treatment modalities for 
oligo brain metastasis (BM), however no comprehensive genomic data assessing the 
effect of radiation on BM in humans exist. Leveraging a unique opportunity, as 
part of the clinical trial (NCT03398694), we collected post-SRS, delivered via 
Gamma-knife or LINAC, tumor samples from core and peripheral-edges of the 
resected tumor to characterize the genomic effects of overall SRS as well as the 
SRS delivery modality. Using these rare patient samples, we show that SRS 
results in significant genomic changes at DNA and RNA levels throughout the 
tumor. Mutations and expression profiles of peripheral tumor samples indicated 
interaction with surrounding brain tissue as well as elevated DNA damage repair. 
Central samples show GSEA enrichment for cellular apoptosis while peripheral 
samples carried an increase in tumor suppressor mutations. There are significant 
differences in the transcriptomic profile at the periphery between Gamma-knife 
vs LINAC.
