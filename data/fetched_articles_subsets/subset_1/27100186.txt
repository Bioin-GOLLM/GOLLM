Diagnosis of chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) depends primarily on renal biopsy, 
which is expensive and requires hospitalization, creating a demand for 
noninvasive diagnostic method for this disease. We used DNA microarray analysis 
to search for genes whose expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) could distinguish between patients with CGN and healthy volunteers 
(HVs). We selected immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and membranous 
nephropathy (MN) as typical forms of CGN. The mRNA level of the gene encoding 
interferon (IFN)-alpha-inducible protein 27, IFI27, which is preferentially 
expressed in podocytes of glomeruli, was lower in PBMCs of IgAN and MN patients 
than in those of HVs. This result was confirmed by quantitative real-time 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, qRT-PCR 
analysis revealed that the IFI27 mRNA level was reduced in PBMCs of patients 
with other types of chronic glomerulonephritis. IFI27 immunohistochemical 
staining of biopsied specimens also confirmed reduced expression of IFI27 
protein in IgAN and MN patients. Based on these results, we propose that IFI27 
could serve as a noninvasive diagnostic marker for CGNs using peripheral blood.
