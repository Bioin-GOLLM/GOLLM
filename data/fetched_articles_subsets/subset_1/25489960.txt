BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is an intractable inflammatory bowel disease of 
unknown cause. Recent genome-wide association studies of CD in Korean and 
Japanese populations suggested marginal sharing of susceptibility loci between 
Caucasian and Asian populations. As the 7 identified loci altogether explain 
5.31% of the risk for CD, the objective of this study was to identify additional 
CD susceptibility loci in the Korean population.
METHODS: Using the ImmunoChip custom single-nucleotide polymorphism array 
designed for dense genotyping of 186 loci identified through GWAS, we analyzed 
722 individuals with CD and 461 controls for 96,048 SNP markers in the discovery 
stage, followed by validation in an additional 948 affected individuals and 977 
controls.
RESULTS: We confirmed 6 previously reported loci in Caucasian: GPR35 at 2q37 
(rs3749172; P = 5.30 × 10, odds ratio [OR] = 1.45), ZNF365 at 10q21 (rs224143; P 
= 2.20 × 10, OR = 1.38), ZMIZ1 at 10q22 (rs1250569; P = 3.05 × 10, OR = 1.30), 
NKX2-3 at 10q24 (rs4409764; P = 7.93 × 10, OR = 1.32), PTPN2 at 18p11 (rs514000; 
P = 9.00 × 10, OR = 1.33), and USP25 at 21q11 (rs2823256; P = 2.49 × 10, OR = 
1.35), bringing the number of known CD loci (including 3 in the HLA) in Koreans 
to 15. The 6 additional loci increased the total genetic variance for CD risk 
from 5.31% to 7.27% in Koreans.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the different genetic backgrounds of CD between Asian and 
Western countries has been well established for the major susceptibility genes, 
our findings of overlapping associations offer new insights into the genetic 
architecture of CD.
