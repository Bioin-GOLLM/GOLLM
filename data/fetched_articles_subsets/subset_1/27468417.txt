BACKGROUND: Familial aggregation and segregation analysis studies have provided 
evidence of a genetic basis for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its 
premalignant precursor, Barrett's esophagus (BE). We aim to demonstrate the 
utility of linkage analysis to identify the genomic regions that might contain 
the genetic variants that predispose individuals to this complex trait (BE and 
EAC).
METHODS: We genotyped 144 individuals in 42 multiplex pedigrees chosen from 1000 
singly ascertained BE/EAC pedigrees, and performed both model-based and 
model-free linkage analyses, using S.A.G.E. and other software. Segregation 
models were fitted, from the data on both the 42 pedigrees and the 1000 
pedigrees, to determine parameters for performing model-based linkage analysis. 
Model-based and model-free linkage analyses were conducted in two sets of 
pedigrees: the 42 pedigrees and a subset of 18 pedigrees with female affected 
members that are expected to be more genetically homogeneous. Genome-wide 
associations were also tested in these families.
RESULTS: Linkage analyses on the 42 pedigrees identified several regions 
consistently suggestive of linkage by different linkage analysis methods on 
chromosomes 2q31, 12q23, and 4p14. A linkage on 15q26 is the only consistent 
linkage region identified in the 18 female-affected pedigrees, in which the 
linkage signal is higher than in the 42 pedigrees. Other tentative linkage 
signals are also reported.
CONCLUSION: Our linkage study of BE/EAC pedigrees identified linkage regions on 
chromosomes 2, 4, 12, and 15, with some reported associations located within our 
linkage peaks. Our linkage results can help prioritize association tests to 
delineate the genetic determinants underlying susceptibility to BE and EAC.
