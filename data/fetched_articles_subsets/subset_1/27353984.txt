OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the 
interferon lambda-3 (IFNλ3) (formal IL-28B) gene rs12979860 in predicting 
sustained virologic response (SVR) in hepatitis-C virus genotype-3 (HCV-3).
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive, analytical study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Medicine, The Aga Khan University 
Hospital, Karachi, from July 2012 to June 2014.
METHODOLOGY: Patients with HCV-3 were classified as sustained virologic response 
(SVR), relapsers and non-responders. SNPrs12979860 was determined by 
PCR-RFLPprotocol. Differences between categorical variables were assessed by 
chi-square or Fisher's exact test, while those between continuous variables were 
evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Binary logistic regression analysis by 
forward conditional method was performed by using significant variables with 
p-values less than 0.05 as the criteria for model inclusion.
RESULTS: Out of 115 patients, rs12979860 genotype-CC, CT, TTwas found in 37 
(32.2%), 70 (60.9%), and 8 (7%) patients. 72 patients were male with median age 
of 45 years. Cirrhosis was present in 32 patients. Patients with response 
failures (no response and relapse, n=36 and 29, respectively) had higher 
baseline gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) level (p < 0.001), higher alanine 
aminotransferase (p=0.027) and cirrhosis (p=0.001) than patients with SVR. 
Genotype-CC was present in 16/65 in response failures compared to 21/50 who 
achieved SVR (p=0.048). Rapid virologic response (RVR) (p < 0.001), low 
GGT(p=0.001) and absence of cirrhosis (p=0.039) were the independent predictive 
factors for SVR. In patients who could not achieve RVR and in patients with 
cirrhosis, SVR was seen more in with genotype-CC (p=0.007 and 0.038).
CONCLUSION: In patients infected with HCV-3, IFNλ3 rs12979860, SNPhas less 
impact on SVR.
