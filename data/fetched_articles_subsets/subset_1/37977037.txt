PURPOSE: Breast cancer is one of the most common tumors with high malignancy and 
metastatic rate. DNAJA1 is closely related to tumor progress in several tumors. 
However, the role and mechanisms of DNAJA1 in the metastasis and proliferation 
of breast cancer are unknown.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and western blot were used to detect the protein 
expression genes. In vivo and vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the 
proliferation, invasive and metastatic abilities of breast cancer cells.
RESULTS: DNAJA1 was high expressed in 234 cases of breast cancer tissues and 
associated with metastasis, p53 expression and poor survival for patients. Knock 
down of DNAJA1 decreased the number of plate clone formation and the OD value of 
CCK8 assays in breast cancer cells. Depletion of DNAJA1 also in decreased the 
invasive abilities of breast cancer cells. In vivo, knock down DNAJA1 decreased 
the growth of subcutaneous tumor and lung metastatic nodes. Mechanically, DNAJA1 
could bind with P53-R175H and reduced its degradation. Up regulation of DNAJA1 
in mutant P53-R175H breast cancer cell promoted the nuclear translocation of 
p65, activated NF-κB pathway and enhanced the transcription of its downstream 
genes such as MMP9, CXCL10 et al. Blockade of NF-κB pathway effectively rescued 
the effects of DNAJA1 on proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that DNAJA1 is up regulated in breast cancer and 
promotes breast cancer cells proliferation and metastasis via P53-R175H/NF-κB 
pathway. It might be a potential prognosis marker for the breast cancer 
patients.
