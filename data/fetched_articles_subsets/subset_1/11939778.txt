Protein dynamics observed by the transient grating (TG) method are studied for 
some site-directed mutants at the distal histidine of myoglobin (H64L, H64Q, 
H64V). The time profiles of the TG signals are very sensitive to the amino acid 
residue of the 64 position. It was found that the sensitivity is mostly caused 
by the different rates of the ligand escape from the protein to solvent and the 
magnitude of the molecular volume change. Several molecular origins of the 
volume difference between MbCO and Mb, such as the electrostatic interaction in 
the distal pocket, movement of helices, and distal water, are proposed. 
Interestingly, the volume difference between the CO-trapped Mb inside the 
protein interior and Mb is similar to that of the partial molar volume of CO in 
organic solvent. The effect of mutation on the nature of the CO trapped site is 
discussed.
