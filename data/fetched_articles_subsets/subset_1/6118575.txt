Antenatal diagnosis of sickle cell anaemia by direct analysis of the sickle 
mutation.

Chang JC, Kan YW.

Sickle cell anemia was detected antenatally by restriction analysis with the 
enzyme Dde I, which cleaves normal human DNA at the position corresponding to 
aminoacid number 6 of the beta-globin chain. This site is abolished by the 
mutation in sickle cell disease, and hence different-sized fragments are 
generated on digestion of normal and sickle genes with this enzyme. In a 
pregnancy at risk for sickle cell anaemia, digestion of DNA from cultured 
amniotic fluid cells revealed a pattern indicating the haemoglobin AA genotype. 
The diagnosis was later confirmed by fetal blood analysis. The test proved 
applicable to the sickle gene from Africa, Asia, The Middle East, and two 
Mediterranean countries.
