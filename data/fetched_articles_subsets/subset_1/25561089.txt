BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for heart 
failure development, but the relationship between incident heart failure and 
antecedent glycemia has not been evaluated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside 
Study study holds data for 8683 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Dispensed prescribing, hospital admission data, and echocardiography reports 
were linked to extract incident heart failure cases from December 1998 to August 
2011. All available HbA1c measures until heart failure development or end of 
study were used to model HbA1c time-dependently. Individuals were observed from 
study enrolment until heart failure development or end of study. Proportional 
hazard regression calculated heart failure development risk associated with 
specific HbA1c ranges accounting for comorbidities associated with heart 
failure, including blood pressure, body mass index, and coronary artery disease. 
Seven hundred and one individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (8%) developed 
heart failure during follow up (mean 5.5 years, ±2.8 years). Time-updated 
analysis with longitudinal HbA1c showed that both HbA1c <6% (hazard ratio =1.60; 
95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.86; P value <0.0001) and HbA1c >10% (hazard 
ratio =1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.60-2.16; P value <0.0001) were 
independently associated with the risk of heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Both high and low HbA1c predicted heart failure development in our 
cohort, forming a U-shaped relationship.
