Molecular chaperones govern protein homeostasis, being allied to the beginning 
(folding) and ending (degradation) of the protein life cycle. Yet, the Hsp90 
system primarily associates with native factors, including fully assembled 
complexes. The significance of these connections is poorly understood. To 
delineate why Hsp90 and its cochaperone p23 interact with a mature structure, we 
focused on the RSC chromatin remodeler. Both Hsp90 and p23 triggered the release 
of RSC from DNA or a nucleosome. Although Hsp90 only freed bound RSC, p23 
enhanced nucleosome remodeling prior to discharging the complex. In vivo, RSC 
mobility and remodeling function were chaperone dependent. Our results suggest 
Hsp90 and p23 contribute to proteostasis by chaperoning mature factors through 
energetically unfavorable events, thereby maintaining the cellular pool of 
active native proteins. In the case of RSC, p23 and Hsp90 promote a dynamic 
action, allowing a limited number of remodelers to effectively maintain 
chromatin in a pliable state.
