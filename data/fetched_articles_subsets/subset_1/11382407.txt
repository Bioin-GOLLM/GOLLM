This study examined the effects of overexpression of presenilin-1 wild-type 
(PS1wt) or mutant L286V (PS1m) in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells on signal 
transduction systems. Oxotremorine-M-induced activation of AP-1 was 40--53% 
lower in PS1wt than control cells, and further impaired (63--76%) in PS1m cells. 
Heat shock (45 degrees C) activated Akt, increased heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1) 
DNA binding activity, and increased levels of heat shock protein 70, and these 
responses were not altered by overexpression of PS1wt or PS1m. H(2)O(2) also 
caused a time-dependent increase in HSF-1 DNA binding activity which was similar 
in all cell lines. Thus, overexpression of PS1wt reduced muscarinic 
receptor-mediated activation of AP-1, and PS1m overexpression caused greater 
inhibition, but stress-induced activation of Akt and HSF-1 was unaffected by 
either PS1wt or PS1m.
