Certain introns significantly increase mRNA accumulation by a poorly understood 
mechanism. These introns have no effect when located upstream, or more than ~1 
Kb downstream, of the start of transcription. We tested the ability of a 
formerly non-stimulating intron containing 11 copies of the sequence TTNGATYTG, 
which is over-represented in promoter-proximal introns in Arabidopsis thaliana, 
to affect expression from various positions. The activity profile of this intron 
at different locations was similar to that of a natural intron from the UBQ10 
gene, suggesting that the motif increases mRNA accumulation by the same 
mechanism. A series of introns with different numbers of this motif revealed 
that the effect on expression is linearly dependent on motif copy number up to 
at least 20, with each copy adding another 1.5-fold increase in mRNA 
accumulation. Furthermore, 6 copies of the motif stimulated mRNA accumulation to 
a similar degree from within an intron or when introduced into the 5'-UTR and 
coding sequences of an intronless construct, demonstrating that splicing is not 
required for this sequence to boost expression. The ability of this motif to 
substantially elevate expression from several hundred nucleotides downstream of 
the transcription start site reveals a novel type of eukaryotic gene regulation.
