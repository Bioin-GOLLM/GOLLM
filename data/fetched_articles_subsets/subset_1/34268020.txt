Introduction While tetanus has largely been eradicated with the advent of the 
tetanus vaccine, its prevalence in Pakistan remains alarmingly high due to 
insufficient uptake of the vaccination program. The clinical presentations that 
the disease elicits range from mere opisthotonos to more sinister complications, 
including respiratory failure and death, often posing an insurmountable 
challenge for hospitals. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was 
conducted and analyzed the medical charts of 43 patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis of tetanus infection. The charts were perused for the patients' 
demographics, clinical characteristics, and disease outcomes. The prevalence of 
various clinical symptoms and complications were reported in terms of 
frequencies and percentages. Results The mean age of the patients hovered at 
29.53 ± 16.53 years, with a range of 12 to 65 years. Of those affected, 83.7% 
were males while 16.3% were females. Notably, none of the infected patients had 
a prior history of vaccination against tetanus. Trismus was noted to be the most 
prevalent clinical manifestation and was found in 90.70% of the patients while 
paraesthesia at the site of infection, found in 6.98%, was the least prevalent. 
The overall mortality was noted to hover at 46.5%. Conclusion While tetanus has 
largely been eradicated, its prevalence in Pakistan remains alarmingly high. The 
complications noted in the study have implications for the country's public 
health system and aims to better inform the current state of the national 
vaccination program.
