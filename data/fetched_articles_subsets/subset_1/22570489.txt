2000 ribosomes have to be synthesized in yeast every minute. Therefore the fast 
production of ribosomal proteins, their efficient delivery to the nucleus and 
correct incorporation into ribosomal subunits are prerequisites for optimal 
growth rates. Here, we report that the ankyrin repeat protein Yar1 directly 
interacts with the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps3 and accompanies newly 
synthesized Rps3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where Rps3 is assembled 
into pre-ribosomal subunits. A yar1 deletion strain displays a similar phenotype 
as an rps3 mutant strain, showing an accumulation of 20S pre-rRNA and a 40S 
export defect. The combination of an rps3 mutation with a yar1 deletion leads to 
an enhancement of these phenotypes, while increased expression of RPS3 
suppresses the defects of a yar1 deletion strain. We further show that Yar1 
protects Rps3 from aggregation in vitro and increases its solubility in vivo. 
Our data suggest that Yar1 is a specific chaperone for Rps3, which serves to 
keep Rps3 soluble until its incorporation into the pre-ribosome.
