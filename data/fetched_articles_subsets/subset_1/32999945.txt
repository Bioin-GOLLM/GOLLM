The ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway mediated by plasma membrane 
Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels regulates a wide variety of 
physiological functions. While it is clearly established that the ORAI1 protein 
is essential for native mammalian CRAC channels, the contribution of ORAI2 and 
ORAI3 have remained nebulous. The crystal structure of the sole Orai isoform in 
drosophila (dOrai) revealed a hexameric assembly, suggesting that mammalian CRAC 
channels are hexamers of ORAI. Nevertheless, the relative contribution of each 
isoform of the mammalian ORAI trio to the stoichiometry of native CRAC channels 
remains elusive. The recent generation of ORAI isoform single, double and triple 
knockout cell lines and tissue-specific knockout mice has shed light on how 
native ORAI isoform heteromerization fine tunes CRAC-mediated Ca2+ signaling.
