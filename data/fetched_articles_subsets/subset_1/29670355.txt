PURPOSE: There is growing evidence that glutamatergic signaling may be involved 
in major depressive disorder (MDD). In regard to peripheral blood glutamate 
changes in MDD, inconsistent findings have been reported. The purpose of the 
present study was to evaluate whether blood glutamate levels differed between 
MDD patients and control participants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 
association studies between blood glutamate levels and MDD in a total of 529 MDD 
patients and 590 controls. Subsequently, we conducted subgroup analyses and a 
meta-regression analysis to examine the sources of potential heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A random effects model showed that blood glutamate levels were 
significantly higher in MDD patients than in controls (standardized mean 
difference=0.54, 95% CI=0.27-0.82, p=8.5Ã—10-5) with high heterogeneity 
(I2=75.0%, p<0.05). Subgroup analyses showed elevated glutamate levels in MDD 
patients compared with controls in plasma, but not serum studies, and in studies 
using high-performance liquid chromatography but not with mass spectrometry for 
glutamate assay. A meta-regression analysis showed no effects of age, gender, 
medication use, sample size, and published year on blood glutamate levels.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that altered glutamate levels may be implicated 
in MDD, which provides further evidence of glutamatergic dysfunction in MDD.
