BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma is a rare intraocular malignancy and typically 
initiated by inactivating biallelic mutations of RB1 gene. Each year, ~ 8000 
children worldwide are diagnosed for retinoblastoma. In high-income countries, 
patient survival is over 95% while low-income countries is ~ 30%.If disease is 
diagnosed early and treated in centers specializing in retinoblastoma, the 
survival might exceed 95% and many eyes could be safely treated and support a 
lifetime of good vision. In China, approximate 1100 newly diagnosed cases are 
expected annually and 28 hospitals covering 25 provinces established centers 
classified by expertise and resources for better treatment options and 
follow-up. Comparing with other province of eastern China, Yunnan province is 
remote geographically. This might result that healthcare staff have low 
awareness of the role of genetic testing in management and screening in 
families.
METHODS: The patients with retinoblastoma were selected in Yunnan. DNA from 
blood was used for targeted gene sequencing. Then, an in-house bioinformatics 
pipeline was done to detect both single nucleotide variants and small 
insertions/deletions. The pathogenic mutations were identified and further 
confirmed by conventional methods and cosegregation in families.
RESULTS: Using our approach, targeted next generation sequencing was used to 
detect the mutation of these 12 probands. Bioinformatic predictions showed that 
nine mutations were found in our study and four were novel pathogenic variants 
in these nine mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: It's the first report to describe RB1 mutations in Yunnan children 
with retinoblastoma. This study would improve role of genetic testing for 
management and family screening.
