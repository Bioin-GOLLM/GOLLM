Divalent inhibitors of the neuraminidase enzyme (NA) of the Influenza A virus 
were synthesized with vastly different spacers. The spacers varied from 14 to 56 
atoms and were relatively rigid by way of the building blocks and their 
connection by CuAAC. As the ligand for these constructs, a Δ4-β-d-glucoronide 
was used, which can be prepared form N-acetyl glucosamine. This ligand showed 
good NA inhibitory potency but with room for improvement by multivalency 
enhancement. The synthesized compounds showed modest potency enhancement in NA 
activity assays but a sizeable potency increase in a 4-day cytopathic effect 
assay. The demonstration that the compounds can also inhibit hemagglutinin in 
addition to NA may be the cause of the enhancement.
