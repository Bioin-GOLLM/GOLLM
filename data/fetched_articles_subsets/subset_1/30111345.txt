BACKGROUND: Alternative RNA processing plays an essential role in shaping cell 
identity and connectivity in the central nervous system. This is believed to 
involve differential regulation of RNA processing in various cell types. 
However, in vivo study of cell type-specific post-transcriptional regulation has 
been a challenge. Here, we describe a sensitive and stringent method combining 
genetics and CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) to globally identify 
regulatory interactions between NOVA and RNA in the mouse spinal cord 
motoneurons.
RESULTS: We developed a means of undertaking motoneuron-specific CLIP to explore 
motoneuron-specific protein-RNA interactions relative to studies of the whole 
spinal cord in mouse. This allowed us to pinpoint differential RNA regulation 
specific to motoneurons, revealing a major role for NOVA in regulating 
cytoskeleton interactions in motoneurons. In particular, NOVA specifically 
promotes the palmitoylated isoform of the cytoskeleton protein Septin 8 in 
motoneurons, which enhances dendritic arborization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that cell type-specific RNA regulation is 
important for fine tuning motoneuron physiology and highlights the value of 
defining RNA processing regulation at single cell type resolution.
