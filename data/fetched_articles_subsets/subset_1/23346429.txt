A patient who presented with sickle retinopathy and hemoglobin electrophoresis 
results compatible with sickle cell trait was found, on further investigation, 
to be a compound heterozygote with hemoglobin S and hemoglobin New York disease. 
This recently reported form of sickle cell disease was not previously known to 
cause retinopathy and surprisingly was observed in a non-Asian individual. The 
ophthalmological findings, the laboratory diagnosis, and possible 
pathophysiology of this disorder are discussed. Persons diagnosed with sickle 
cell trait who present with symptoms of sickle cell disease may benefit from 
specific screening for this variant.
