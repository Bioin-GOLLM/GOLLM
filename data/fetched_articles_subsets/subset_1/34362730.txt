In olfactory systems across phyla, most sensory neurons express a single 
olfactory receptor gene selected from a large genomic repertoire. We describe 
previously unknown receptor gene-dependent mechanisms that ensure singular 
expression of receptors encoded by a tandem gene array [Ionotropic receptor 75c 
(Ir75c), Ir75b, and Ir75a, organized 5' to 3'] in Drosophila melanogaster 
Transcription from upstream genes in the cluster runs through the coding region 
of downstream loci and inhibits their expression in cis, most likely via 
transcriptional interference. Moreover, Ir75c blocks accumulation of other 
receptor proteins in trans through a protein-dependent, posttranscriptional 
mechanism. These repression mechanisms operate in endogenous neurons, in 
conjunction with cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, to ensure unique 
receptor expression. Our data provide evidence for inter-olfactory receptor 
regulation in invertebrates and highlight unprecedented, but potentially 
widespread, mechanisms for ensuring exclusive expression of chemosensory 
receptors, and other protein families, encoded by tandemly arranged genes.
