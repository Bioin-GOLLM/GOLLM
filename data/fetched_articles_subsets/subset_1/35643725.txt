Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has nowadays been applied to non-small 
cell lung cancer harboring activated EGFR mutation with or without T790M, but 
ultimately develop resistance to this drug. Here we report a novel mechanism of 
acquired resistance to osimertinib and the reversal of which could improve the 
clinical outcomes. In osimertinib-resistant lung cancer cell lines harboring 
T790M mutation that we established, expression of multiple EGFR family proteins 
and MET was markedly reduced, whereas expression of AXL, CDCP1 and SRC was 
augmented along with activation of AKT. Surprisingly, AXL or CDCP1 expression 
was induced by osimertinib in a time-dependent manner up to 3 months. Silencing 
of CDCP1 or AXL restored the sensitivity to osimertinib with reduced activation 
of SRC and AKT. Furthermore, silencing of both CDCP1 and AXL increased the 
sensitivity to osimertinib. Either silencing of SRC or dasatinib, a SRC family 
kinase (SFK) inhibitor, suppressed AKT phosphorylation and cell growth. 
Increased expression of AXL and CDCP1 was observed in refractory tumor samples 
from patients with lung cancer treated with osimertinib. Together, this study 
suggests that AXL/SFK/AKT and CDCP1/SFK/AKT signaling pathways play some roles 
in acquired osimertinib resistance of non-small cell lung cancer.
