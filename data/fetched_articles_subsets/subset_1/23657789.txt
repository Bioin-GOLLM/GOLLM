BACKGROUND: A point mutation (V600E) in the BRAF oncogene is a prognostic 
biomarker and may predict for nonresponse to anti-EGFR antibody therapy in 
patients with colorectal carcinoma. BRAFV600E mutations are frequently detected 
in tumors with microsatellite instability and indicate a sporadic origin. We 
used a mutation-specific antibody to examine mutant BRAFV600E protein expression 
and its concordance with BRAFV600E mutation data.
METHODS: Primary stage III colon carcinomas were analyzed for BRAFV600E 
mutations in exon 15, and 50 BRAFV600E mutation carriers and 25 wild-type tumors 
were selected for analysis of BRAF proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC 
was performed in archival tissue specimens using a pan-BRAF antibody and a 
mutation-specific antibody against BRAFV600E proteins. Staining was scored by 2 
pathologists who were blinded to clinical and mutation data.
RESULTS: Using a pan-BRAF antibody, total BRAF protein expression was observed 
in the tumor cell cytoplasm in 74 of 75 colon carcinomas. A mutation-specific 
antibody identified diffuse cytoplasmic staining of mutant BRAFV600E proteins in 
49 of 74 cancers. Analysis using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay 
revealed that all 49 of these cancers carried BRAFV600E mutations. In contrast, 
BRAFV600E staining was absent in all 25 tumors that carried wild-type copies of 
BRAF.
CONCLUSIONS: A BRAF mutation-specific (V600E) antibody detected tumors with 
BRAFV600E mutations and exhibited complete concordance with a DNA-based method. 
These results support the use of IHC as a simplified strategy to screen 
colorectal cancers for BRAFV600E mutations in clinical practice.
