Myosin superfamily, a large and diverse family of molecular motors important for 
cell motility and migration, has been illustrated to play contradictory roles 
during the development of several kinds of tumors. However, the function and 
prognostic values of MYOs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) still 
remain largely unknown. In the current manuscript, the expression levels and 
clinical data of MYOs in HNSCC were investigated by online databases, including 
Oncomine, GEPIA, GEO, TCGA, HPA, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and CancerSEA; we 
found that the expression levels of MYO1B, MYO5A, and MYO10 were significantly 
elevated in HNSCC tissues, which were also correlated with the unfavorable 
overall survival (OS) of the patients. Furthermore, MYO1B/MYO5A/MYO10 
interacting genes were identified, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
networks were constructed by STRING and GeneMANIA. The enrichment analysis 
revealed that MYO1B/MYO5A/MYO10 associated genes mainly participated in cell 
metastasis and EMT processes, which were also confirmed by cell functional 
experiments. At last, the ssGSEA method was conducted to investigate the extent 
of immune cell infiltration, and we found that both the expression of 
MYO1B/MYO5A/MYO10 were closely correlated with the infiltration of immune cells 
in HNSCC. These findings implied that MYO1B, MYO5A, and MYO10 as novel 
prognostic factors for HNSCC and provided new strategy for HNSCC treatment.
