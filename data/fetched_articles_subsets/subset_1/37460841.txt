One lead genetic risk signal of obesity-the rs1421085 T>C variant within the FTO 
gene-is reported to be functional in vitro but lacks evidence at an organism 
level. Here we recapitulate the homologous human variant in mice with global and 
brown adipocyte-specific variant knock-in and reveal that mice carrying the 
C-allele show increased brown fat thermogenic capacity and resistance to 
high-fat diet-induced adiposity, whereas the obesity-related phenotypic changes 
are blunted at thermoneutrality. Both in vivo and in vitro data reveal that the 
C-allele in brown adipocytes enhances the transcription of the Fto gene, which 
is associated with stronger chromatin looping linking the enhancer region and 
Fto promoter. Moreover, FTO knockdown or inhibition effectively eliminates the 
increased thermogenic ability of brown adipocytes carrying the C-allele. Taken 
together, these findings identify rs1421085 T>C as a functional variant 
promoting brown fat thermogenesis.
