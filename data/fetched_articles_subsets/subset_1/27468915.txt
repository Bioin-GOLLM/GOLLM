Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant 
disorder characterized by the early onset of colorectal cancer (CRC) linked to 
germline defects in Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes. We present here, the first 
molecular study of the correlation between CRC and mutations occurring in these 
genes performed in twenty-one unrelated Algerian families. The presence of 
germline mutations in MMR genes, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes was tested by 
sequencing all exons plus adjacent intronic sequences and Multiplex 
ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for testing large genomic 
rearrangements. Pathogenic mutations were identified in 20Â % of families with 
clinical suspicion on HNPCC. Two novel variants described for the first time in 
Algerian families were identified in MLH1, c.881_884delTCAGinsCATTCCT and a 
large deletion in MSH6 gene from a young onset of CRC. Moreover, the variants of 
MSH2 gene: c.942+3A>T, c.1030C>T, the most described ones, were also detected in 
Algerian families. Furthermore, the families HNPCC caused by MSH6 germline 
mutation may show an age of onset that is comparable to this of patients with 
MLH1 and MSH2 mutations. In this study, we confirmed that MSH2, MLH1, and MSH6 
contribute to CRC susceptibility. This work represents the implementation of a 
diagnostic algorithm for the identification of Lynch syndrome patients in 
Algerian families.
