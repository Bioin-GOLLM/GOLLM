Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are ATP-independent chaperones that help 
correct the folding of denatured proteins and protect cells from stress. 
Mutations in HSPB1, HSPB8, and HSPB3 are implicated in inherited peripheral 
neuropathies (IPNs), such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) and 
distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN). This study, using whole exome 
sequencing or targeted gene sequencing, identified 9 pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic variants in these three sHSP genes from 11 Korean IPN families. Most 
variants were located in the evolutionally well conserved Î±-crystallin domain, 
except for p.P182S and p.S187L in HSPB1. As an atypical case, a patient with 
dHMN2 showed two compound heterozygous variants of p.R127Q and p.Y142H in HSPB1, 
suggesting a putative case of recessive inheritance, which requires additional 
research to confirm. Three HSPB8 variants were located in the p.K141 residue, 
which seemed to be a mutational hot spot. There were no significant differences 
between patient groups, which divided by sHSP genes for clinical symptoms such 
as onset age, severity, and nerve conduction. Early-onset patients showed a 
tendency of slightly decreased sensory nerve conduction values compared with 
late-onset patients. As a first Korean IPN cohort study examining sHSP genes, 
these results will, we believe, be helpful for molecular diagnosis and care of 
patients with CMT2 and dHMN.
