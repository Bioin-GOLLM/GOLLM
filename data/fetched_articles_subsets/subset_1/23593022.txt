As a master regulator of jasmonic acid (JA)-signaled plant immune responses, the 
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) Leu zipper transcription factor MYC2 
differentially regulates different subsets of JA-responsive genes through 
distinct mechanisms. However, how MYC2 itself is regulated at the protein level 
remains unknown. Here, we show that proteolysis of MYC2 plays a positive role in 
regulating the transcription of its target genes. We discovered a 12-amino-acid 
element in the transcription activation domain (TAD) of MYC2 that is required 
for both the proteolysis and the transcriptional activity of MYC2. 
Interestingly, MYC2 phosphorylation at residue Thr328, which facilitates its 
turnover, is also required for the MYC2 function to regulate gene transcription. 
Together, these results reveal that phosphorylation-coupled turnover of MYC2 
stimulates its transcription activity. Our results exemplify that, as with 
animals, plants employ an "activation by destruction" mechanism to fine-tune 
their transcriptome to adapt to their ever-changing environment.
