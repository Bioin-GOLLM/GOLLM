Malignant melanoma of the conjunctiva is a rare but serious condition. Over the 
last several years, there have been important advances in the classification, 
diagnosis, and treatment of this condition. Recent cytogenetic and 
immunohistochemical studies are increasing understanding of its tumorigenesis. 
Diagnosis, although still made via histopathology, has been aided with imaging 
techniques such as ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical 
coherence tomography. Primary treatment consists of surgical excision. But 
adjuvant treatments with cryotherapy, topical chemotherapy, and radiation 
therapy have shown increased success. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has shown early 
promise of detecting micro-metastasis. Long term follow-up of patients with 
conjunctival melanoma with systemic surveillance is necessary to detect 
recurrences and metastases.
