Psychiatric disorders are a collection of heterogeneous mental disorders arising 
from a contribution of genetic and environmental insults, many of which 
molecularly converge on transcriptional dysregulation, resulting in altered 
synaptic functions. The underlying mechanisms linking the genetic lesion and 
functional phenotypes remain largely unknown. Patient iPSC-derived neurons with 
a rare frameshift DISC1 (Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) mutation have previously 
been shown to exhibit aberrant gene expression and deficits in synaptic 
functions. How DISC1 regulates gene expression is largely unknown. Here we show 
that Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4), a DISC1 binding partner, is more 
abundant in the nucleus of DISC1 mutant human neurons and exhibits enhanced 
binding to a collection of dysregulated genes. Functionally, overexpressing ATF4 
in control neurons recapitulates deficits seen in DISC1 mutant neurons, whereas 
transcriptional and synaptic deficits are rescued in DISC1 mutant neurons with 
CRISPR-mediated heterozygous ATF4 knockout. By solving the high-resolution 
atomic structure of the DISC1-ATF4 complex, we show that mechanistically, the 
mutation of DISC1 disrupts normal DISC1-ATF4 interaction, and results in 
excessive ATF4 binding to DNA targets and deregulated gene expression. Together, 
our study identifies the molecular and structural basis of an DISC1-ATF4 
interaction underlying transcriptional and synaptic dysregulation in an iPSC 
model of mental disorders.
