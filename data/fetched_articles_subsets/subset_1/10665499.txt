A novel missense mutation, Leu723Pro, in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
gene was discovered in an early-onset Alzheimer's disease family. Expression of 
L723P mutant APP complementary DNA in CHO cells resulted in a 1.4- to 1.9-fold 
increased production of the 42(43)-amino acid length amyloid beta peptide 
compared with the wild-type sequence and was capable of causing apoptosis. The 
mutation is predicted to alter the luminal transmembrane length and helical 
arrangement of the APP molecule and thus affect the gamma-secretase cleavage 
site.
