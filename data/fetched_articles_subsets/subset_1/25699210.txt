Nephila clavata L Koch, known as the Joro spider and native to East Asia (Japan, 
China, Korea, and Taiwan), is newly reported from North America. Specimens from 
several locations in northeast Georgia were collected from around residential 
properties in Barrow, Jackson, and Madison counties in late October and early 
November 2014. These are the first confirmed records of the species in the New 
World. Our collections, along with confirmed images provided by private 
citizens, suggest that the Joro spider is established in northeast Georgia. 
Genomic sequence data for the COI gene obtained from two specimens conforms to 
published sequences for N. clavata, providing additional confirmation of species 
identity. Known collection records are listed and mapped using geocoding. Our 
observations are summarized along with published background information on 
biology in Asia and we hypothesize on the invasion history and mode of 
introduction into North America. Recognition features are given and photographic 
images of the male and female are provided to aid in their differentiation from 
the one native species of the genus (Nephila clavipes) in North America.
