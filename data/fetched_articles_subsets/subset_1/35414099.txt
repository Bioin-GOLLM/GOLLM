Kidneys are key regulators of phosphate homeostasis. Biallelic mutations of the 
renal Na+/phosphate cotransporter SLC34A1/NaPi-IIa cause idiopathic infantile 
hypercalcemia, whereas monoallelic mutations were frequently noted in adults 
with kidney stones. Genome-wide-association studies identified SLC34A1 as a risk 
locus for chronic kidney disease. Pathogenic mutations in SLC34A1 are present in 
4% of the general population. Here, we characterize a mouse model carrying the 
91del7 in-frame deletion, a frequent mutation whose significance remains 
unclear. Under normal dietary conditions, 12 weeks old heterozygous and 
homozygous males have similar plasma and urinary levels of phosphate as their 
wild type (WT) littermates, and comparable concentrations of parathyroid 
hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3. Renal 
phosphate transport, and expression of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc cotransporters, was 
indistinguishable in the three genotypes. Challenging mice with low dietary 
phosphate did not result in differences between genotypes with regard to urinary 
and plasma phosphate. Urinary and plasma phosphate, plasma FGF-23 and expression 
of cotransporters were similar in all genotypes after weaning. Urinary phosphate 
and bone mineral density were also comparable in 300 days old WT and mutant 
mice. In conclusion, mice carrying the 91del7 truncation do not show signs of 
impaired phosphate homeostasis.
