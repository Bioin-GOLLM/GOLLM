In addition to sculpting eukaryotic transcripts by removing introns, pre-mRNA 
splicing greatly impacts protein composition of the emerging mRNP. The exon 
junction complex (EJC), deposited upstream of exon-exon junctions after 
splicing, is a major constituent of spliced mRNPs. Here, we report comprehensive 
analysis of the endogenous human EJC protein and RNA interactomes. We confirm 
that the major "canonical" EJC occupancy site in vivo lies 24 nucleotides 
upstream of exon junctions and that the majority of exon junctions carry an EJC. 
Unexpectedly, we find that endogenous EJCs multimerize with one another and with 
numerous SR proteins to form megadalton sized complexes in which SR proteins are 
super-stoichiometric to EJC core factors. This tight physical association may 
explain known functional parallels between EJCs and SR proteins. Further, their 
protection of long mRNA stretches from nuclease digestion suggests that 
endogenous EJCs and SR proteins cooperate to promote mRNA packaging and 
compaction.
