Different species belonging to the genus Nephthea (Acyonaceae) are a rich 
resource for bioactive secondary metabolites. The literature reveals that the 
gastroprotective effects of marine secondary metabolites have not been 
comprehensively studied in vivo. Hence, the present investigation aimed to 
examine and determine the anti-ulcer activity of 
4α,24-dimethyl-5α-cholest-8β,18-dihydroxy,22E-en-3β-ol (ST-1) isolated from 
samples of a Nephthea species. This in vivo study was supported by in silico 
molecular docking and protein-protein interaction techniques. Oral 
administration of ST-1 reduced rat stomach ulcers with a concurrent increase in 
gastric mucosa. Molecular docking calculations against the H+/K+-ATPase 
transporter showed a higher binding affinity of ST-1, with a docking score value 
of -9.9 kcal/mol and a pKi value of 59.7 nM, compared to ranitidine (a 
commercial proton pump inhibitor, which gave values of -6.2 kcal/mol and 27.9 
µM, respectively). The combined PEA-reactome analysis results revealed promising 
evidence of ST-1 potency as an anti-ulcer compound through significant 
modulation of the gene set controlling the PI3K signaling pathway, which 
subsequently plays a crucial role in signaling regarding epithelialization and 
tissue regeneration, tissue repairing and tissue remodeling. These results 
indicate a probable protective role for ST-1 against ethanol-induced gastric 
ulcers.
