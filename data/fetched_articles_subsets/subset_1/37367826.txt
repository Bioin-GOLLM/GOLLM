Branching morphogenesis is an evolutionary solution to maximize epithelial 
function in a compact organ. It involves successive rounds of branch elongation 
and branch point formation to generate a tubular network. In all organs, branch 
points can form by tip splitting, but it is unclear how tip cells coordinate 
elongation and branching. Here, we addressed these questions in the embryonic 
mammary gland. Live imaging revealed that tips advance by directional cell 
migration and elongation relies upon differential cell motility that feeds a 
retrograde flow of lagging cells into the trailing duct, supported by tip 
proliferation. Tip bifurcation involved localized repression of cell cycle and 
cell motility at the branch point. Cells in the nascent daughter tips remained 
proliferative but changed their direction to elongate new branches. We also 
report the fundamental importance of epithelial cell contractility for mammary 
branching morphogenesis. The co-localization of cell motility, non-muscle myosin 
II, and ERK activities at the tip front suggests coordination/cooperation 
between these functions.
