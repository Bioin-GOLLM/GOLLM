Various glutamate urea ligands have displayed high affinities to prostate 
specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is highly overexpressed in prostate and 
other cancer sites. The multivalent versions of small PSMA-targeted molecules 
are known to be even more efficiently bound to the receptor. Here, we employ a 
well-known urea-based ligand, 2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-ureido] pentanedioic 
acid (DUPA) and triazine dendrimers in order to study the effect of molecular 
size on multivalent targeting in prostate cancer. The synthetic route starts 
with the preparation of a dichlorotriazine bearing DUPA in 67% overall yield 
over five steps. This dichlorotriazine reacts with G1, G3, and G5 triazine 
dendrimers bearing a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid 
(DOTA) group for 64Cu-labeling at the core to afford poly(monochlorotriazine) 
intermediates. Addition of 4-aminomethylpiperidine (4-AMP) and the following 
deprotection produce the target compounds, G1-(DUPA)4, G3-(DUPA)16, and 
G5-(DUPA)64. These targets include 4/16/64 DUPA groups on the surface and a DOTA 
group at the core, respectively. In vitro cell assay using PC3-PIP (PSMA 
positive) and PC3-FLU (PSMA negative) cells reveals that G1-(DUPA)4 has the 
highest PC3-PIP to PC3-FLU uptake ratio (10-fold) through the PSMA-mediated 
specific uptake. While G5-(DUPA)64 displayed approximately 12 times higher 
binding affinity (IC50 23.6 nM) to PC3-PIP cells than G1-(DUPA)4 (IC50 282.3 nM) 
as evaluated in a competitive binding assay, the G5 dendrimer also showed high 
non-specific binding to PC3-FLU cells. In vivo uptake of the 64Cu-labeled 
dendrimers was also evaluated in severe combined inmmunodeficient (SCID) mice 
bearing PC3-PIP and PC3-FLU xenografts on each shoulder, respectively. 
Interestingly, quantitative imaging analysis of positron emission tomograph 
(PET) displayed the lowest tumor uptake in PC3-PIP cells for the midsize 
dendrimer G3-(DUPA)16 (19.4 kDa) (0.66 ± 0.15%ID/g at 1 h. p.i., 0.64 ± 
0.11%ID/g at 4 h. p.i., and 0.67 ± 0.08%ID/g at 24 h. p.i.). Through the 
specific binding of G1-(DUPA)4 to PSMA, the smallest dendrimer (5.1 kDa) 
demonstrated the highest PC3-PIP to muscle and PC3-PIP to PC3-FLU uptake ratios 
(17.7 ± 5.5 and 6.7 ± 3.0 at 4 h p.i., respectively). In addition, the enhanced 
permeability and retention (EPR) effect appeared to be an overwhelming factor 
for tumor uptake of the largest dendrimer G5-(DUPA)64 as the uptake was at a 
similar level irrelevant to the PSMA expression.
