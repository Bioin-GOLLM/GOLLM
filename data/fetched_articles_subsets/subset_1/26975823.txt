OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in IL1R1 gene (rs1558641 and rs949963) with the susceptibility to asthma 
in children from Central China.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed in the asthma group and the control 
group, consisting of 208 children with asthma and 223 normal children from 
Central China, respectively. The genotypes of two SNPs in IL1R1 gene, rs1558641 
and rs949963, were identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism. The serum level of IL1R1 was determined by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in genotype and allele 
frequencies of rs1558641 between the asthma and control groups. In terms of 
rs949963, the frequencies of GG genotype and alleles were significantly higher 
in the asthma group than in the control group (P<0.05). The asthma group had a 
significantly higher serum level of IL1R1 than the control group (P=0.011). 
Moreover, the serum level of IL1R1 was significantly higher in patients with GG 
genotype than in those with AA or AG genotype for rs949963 (P=0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: IL1R1 SNP rs949963 is associated with the susceptibility to asthma 
in children from Central China and may increase the serum expression of IL1R1.

目的: 探讨我国中部地区儿童IL1R1基因的两个SNP位点(rs1558641和rs949963)的多态性与哮喘易感性的相关性。
方法: 采用病例-对照的研究方法, 
选取来自于我国中部地区的208例哮喘患儿(哮喘组)和223例同时期体检正常的儿童(健康对照组)作为研究对象。利用限制性片段长度多态性分析(PCRRFLP)的方法检测IL1R1基因两个SNP位点(rs1558641和rs949963)的多态性分布; 
酶联免疫吸附试验(ELISA)测定血清中IL1R1的水平。
结果: 
哮喘组患儿SNP位点(rs1558641)的基因型及等位基因频率与健康对照组相比差异无统计学意义。而哮喘组患儿SNP位点(rs949963)GG基因型的比例显著高于健康对照组(P=0.031), 
且两组等位基因频率差异也有统计学意义(P=0.018)。哮喘组血清IL1R1的水平明显高于健康对照组(P=0.011), 
且SNP位点(rs949963)GG基因型的患儿血清IL1R1水平高于其他基因型(AA+AG)的患儿(P=0.028)。
结论: IL1R1基因SNP位点(rs949963)的多态性与我国中部地区儿童哮喘的易感性相关, 且该位点的多态性可能影响患儿血清中IL1R1的表达水平。
