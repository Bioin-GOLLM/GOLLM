PURPOSE: To identify the structural features responsible for the differences in 
coenzyme and inhibitor specificities of aldose and aldehyde reductases.
METHODS: The crystal structure of porcine aldehyde reductase in complex with 
NADPH and the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil was determined. The 
contribution of each amino acid lining the coenzyme-binding site to the binding 
of NADPH was calculated using the Discover package. In human aldose reductase, 
the role of the non-conserved Pro 216 (Ser in aldehyde reductase) in the binding 
of coenzyme was examined by site-directed mutagenesis.
RESULTS: Sorbinil binds to the active site of aldehyde reductase and is 
hydrogen-bonded to Trp 22, Tyr 50, His 113, and the non-conserved Arg 312. 
Unlike tolrestat, the binding of sorbinil does not induce a change in the side 
chain conformation of Arg 312. Mutation of Pro 216 to Ser in aldose reductase 
makes the binding of coenzyme more similar to that of aldehyde reductase.
CONCLUSIONS: The participation of non-conserved active site residues in the 
binding of inhibitors and the differences in the structural changes required for 
the binding to occur are responsible for the differences in the potency of 
inhibition of aldose and aldehyde reductases. We report that the non-conserved 
Pro 216 in aldose reductase contributes to the tight binding of NADPH.
