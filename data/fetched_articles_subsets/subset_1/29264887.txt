BACKGROUND: Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Many 
studies have revealed associations between the rs4295627 polymorphism in the 
coiled-coil domain containing 26 (CCDC26) gene and the risk of glioma. However, 
the conclusions are still unclear because some studies have reported 
inconsistent results.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present meta-analysis was to determine the 
relationship and quantitatively evaluate the effect of the rs4295627 
polymorphism on the risk of glioma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data was extracted from PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar, 
with the most recent search up to December, 2015. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% 
CIs were used to evaluate the effect of CCDC26 rs4295627 polymorphisms on 
glioma. A test of heterogeneity and an assessment of publication bias were also 
performed.
RESULTS: A total of 11 studies (8292 cases and 12,419 controls) were selected 
for this meta-analysis. Significant associations were observed in all genetic 
analysis models (G vs T: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.12-1.43; GG vs TT: OR = 1.72, 95% 
CI = 1.24-2.39; GT vs TT: OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.24-1.42; GG + GT vs TT: OR = 
1.36, 95% CI = 1.20-1.53; GG vs GT + TT: OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.18-2.29, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results of the present study clearly show that the G allele of 
the rs4295627 polymorphism significantly increases the risk of glioma. 
Nevertheless, well-designed large-scale studies are needed to further evaluate 
the effect of the rs4295627 polymorphism on different types or degrees of glioma 
in different ethnic groups as well as to measure the combined effects on glioma 
risk.
