The pathological accumulation of the microtubule binding protein tau drives 
age-related neurodegeneration in a variety of disorders, collectively called 
tauopathies. In the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 
accumulation of pathological tau strongly correlates with cognitive decline. The 
underlying molecular mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in tauopathies 
remain incompletely understood and no effective disease modifying 
pharmacological interventions currently exist. Here, we show that tau toxicity 
depends on the highly conserved nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein SPOP 
in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of tauopathy. Loss of function mutations in 
the C. elegans spop-1 gene significantly improves behavioral deficits in tau 
transgenic animals, while neuronal overexpression of SPOP-1 protein 
significantly worsens behavioral deficits. In addition, loss of spop-1 rescues a 
variety of tau-related phenotypes including the accumulation of total and 
phosphorylated tau protein, neurodegeneration, and shortened lifespan. Knockdown 
of SPOP-1's E3 ubiquitin ligase cul-3/Cullin3 does not improve tauopathy 
suggesting a non-degradative mechanism of action for SPOP-1. Suppression of 
disease-related phenotypes occurs independently of the nuclear speckle resident 
poly(A)-binding protein SUT-2/MSUT2. MSUT2 modifies tauopathy in mammalian 
neurons and in AD. Our work identifies SPOP as a novel modifier of tauopathy and 
a conceptual pathway for therapeutic intervention.
