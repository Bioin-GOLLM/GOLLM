Imatinib mesylate, a competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is considered the 
first-line therapy drug for Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Three 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B 
(MDR/TAP), member 1 gene (ABCB1/MDR1), c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A and c.3435C>T, 
have been shown to affect cellular transport/metabolism of imatinib. The 
associations between these SNPs and imatinib response in CML patients have been 
widely evaluated, but the results were inconsistent. To derive a conclusive 
assessment of the associations, we performed a meta-analysis by combining data 
from a total of 12 reports including 1826 patients. The results showed that the 
2677G allele or 3435T allele predicted a worse response to imatinib in CML 
patients, whereas 1236CC genotype was associated with better response in CML 
patients from Asian region. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that 
c.1236C>T, c.2677G>T/A and c.3435C>T can be served as predictive markers for the 
therapeutical use of imatinib in CML patients.
