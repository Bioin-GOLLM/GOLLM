Pathogenic variants in LPIN1 are a recognised cause of severe and often fatal 
rhabdomyolysis in childhood. We present a rare case of adult onset recurrent 
rhabdomyolysis due to compound heterozygous variants in LPIN1. Despite first 
presenting with rhabdomyolysis in his twenties and having undergone extensive 
investigations, the patient did not receive a diagnosis until he was 46 years of 
age. DNA sequencing revealed a pathogenic deletion involving exon 18 of LPIN1 in 
conjunction with a c.2410G>A missense variant in exon 19. Whilst LPIN1 variants 
are a noteworthy cause of severe recurrent rhabdomyolysis in childhood, this is 
the first detailed description and only the second reported case of adult onset 
rhabdomyolysis. Variants in LPIN1 should be considered as a cause of recurrent 
severe rhabdomyolysis in adults when other more common causes have been 
excluded.
