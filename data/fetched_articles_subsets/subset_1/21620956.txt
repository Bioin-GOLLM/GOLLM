Neurotransmission by serotonin (5-HT) is tightly regulated by several 
autoreceptors that fine-tune serotonergic neurotransmission through negative 
feedback inhibition at the cell bodies (predominantly 5-HT(1A)) or at the axon 
terminals (predominantly 5-HT(1B)); however, more subtle roles for 5-HT(1D) and 
5-HT(2B) autoreceptors have also been detected. This review provides an overview 
of 5-HT autoreceptors, focusing on their contribution in animal behavioral 
models of stress and emotion. Experiments targeting 5-HT autoreceptors in awake, 
behaving animals have generally shown that increasing autoreceptor feedback is 
anxiolytic and rewarding, while enhanced 5-HT function is aversive and 
anxiogenic; however, the role of serotonergic activity in behavioral models of 
helplessness is more complex. The prevailing model suggests that 5-HT 
autoreceptors become desensitized in response to stress exposure and 
antidepressant administration, two seemingly opposite manipulations. Thus there 
are still unresolved questions regarding the role of these receptors-and 
serotonin in general-in normal and pathological states.
