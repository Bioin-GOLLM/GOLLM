Plasma amyloid-beta (Aβ) has long been investigated as a blood biomarker 
candidate for Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA), however previous findings have 
been inconsistent which could be attributed to the use of less sensitive assays. 
This study investigates plasma Aβ alterations between pre-symptomatic Dutch-type 
hereditary CAA (D-CAA) mutation-carriers (MC) and non-carriers (NC) using two Aβ 
measurement platforms. Seventeen pre-symptomatic members of a D-CAA pedigree 
were assembled and followed up 3-4 years later (NC = 8; MC = 9). Plasma Aβ1-40 
and Aβ1-42 were cross-sectionally and longitudinally analysed at baseline (T1) 
and follow-up (T2) and were found to be lower in MCs compared to NCs, 
cross-sectionally after adjusting for covariates, at both T1(Aβ1-40: p = 0.001; 
Aβ1-42: p = 0.0004) and T2 (Aβ1-40: p = 0.001; Aβ1-42: p = 0.016) employing the 
Single Molecule Array (Simoa) platform, however no significant differences were 
observed using the xMAP platform. Further, pairwise longitudinal analyses of 
plasma Aβ1-40 revealed decreased levels in MCs using data from the Simoa 
platform (p = 0.041) and pairwise longitudinal analyses of plasma Aβ1-42 
revealed decreased levels in MCs using data from the xMAP platform (p = 0.041). 
Findings from the Simoa platform suggest that plasma Aβ may add value to a panel 
of biomarkers for the diagnosis of pre-symptomatic CAA, however, further 
validation studies in larger sample sets are required.
