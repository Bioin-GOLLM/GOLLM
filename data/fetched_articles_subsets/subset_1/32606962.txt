OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the effects of the long non-coding 
(lnc) RNA MT1JP on the apoptosis and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma 
cells.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with liver cancer admitted to the Second People's 
Hospital of Liaocheng were included in this study. We transfected hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells with MT1JP and miR-24-3p and assessed their expression and 
effects on apoptosis and migration. Correlations were verified using a 
dual-luciferase reporter and RNA-binding protein coimmunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: The expression of MT1JP was downregulated (P < 0.05), whereas that of 
miR-24-3p was upregulated in liver cancer. Serum MT1JP levels were correlated 
with tumor size, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), TNM stage, differentiation, and lymph 
node metastasis. Both MT1JP overexpression and miR-24-3p inhibition inhibited 
cellular proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis rates. They 
significantly downregulated expression of the cell migration-associated proteins 
matrix metalloproteinase -2, -9 (MMP-2, MMP-9) (P < 0.05). They upregulated the 
expression of Bcl-2-related X protein (Bax) and cysteinyl aspartate-specific 
proteinases (Caspase-3 and -9) proteins that are involved in apoptosis. They 
decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2; P < 0.05). A target 
relationship between MT1JP and miR-24-3p was identified using dual-luciferase 
gene reporter assays and RNA-binding protein coimmunoprecipitations. MT1JP 
overexpression significantly downregulated miR-24-3p expression (P < 0.05). 
MT1JP and miR-24-3p expression were negatively correlated in liver cancer 
tissues (r = -0.561, P < 0.001; Pearson χ2 tests). Rescue experiments showed 
that upregulating miR-24-3p expression could counteract MT1JP overexpression in 
hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
CONCLUSION: MT1JP, even when expressed at low levels, participates in the 
proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of liver cancer cells by regulating 
miR-24-3p.
