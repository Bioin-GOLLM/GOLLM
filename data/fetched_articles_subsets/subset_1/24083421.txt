KIT/KITLG signaling system is crucial for spermatogenesis, which suggests that 
KIT and KITLG genes may be involved in spermatogenesis impairment and male 
infertility. To explore the possible association of KIT and KITLG genes with 
male infertility having spermatogenesis impairment, polymorphism distributions 
of SNP rs3819392 in KIT gene as well as rs995030 and rs4474514 in KITLG gene 
were investigated in 372 patients with idiopathic azoospermia or oligospermia 
and 205 fertile controls. As a result, the significant differences in 
polymorphism distributions of SNP rs3819392 in KIT gene and rs4474514 in KITLG 
gene were observed between the patients with oligospermia and controls. The 
frequencies of allele G (94.2% versus 90.0% p = 0.022) and genotype GG (89.2% 
versus 82.0% p = 0.042) in patients with oligospermia were significantly higher 
than those in controls at rs3819392 locus in KIT gene. In addition, the genotype 
CC of rs4474514 in KITLG (8.2% versus 3.4%, p = 0.034) also significantly 
increased in oligospermic patients in comparison to controls. These findings 
indicated that SNP rs3819392 in KIT gene and rs4474514 in KITLG gene may be 
associated with oligospermia, suggesting that polymorphism of KIT and KITLG 
genes may play a role in oligospermia.
