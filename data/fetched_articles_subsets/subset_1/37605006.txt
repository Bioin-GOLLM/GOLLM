Impaired transcription factor EB (TFEB) function and deficient autophagy 
activity have been shown to aggravate intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration 
(IDD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain less clear. Protein 
posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are critical for determining TFEB 
trafficking and transcriptional activity. Here, we demonstrate that TFEB 
activity is controlled by protein methylation in degenerated nucleus pulposus 
cells (NPCs), even though TFEB itself is incapable of undergoing methylation. 
Specifically, protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit alpha (PPP1CA), newly 
identified to dephosphorylate TFEB, contains a K141 mono-methylated site. In 
degenerated NPCs, increased K141-methylation of PPP1CA disrupts its interaction 
with TEFB and subsequently blocks TEFB dephosphorylation and nuclear 
translocation, which eventually leads to autophagy deficiency and NPC 
senescence. In addition, we found that the PPP1CA-mediated targeting of TFEB is 
facilitated by the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 9B (PPP1R9B), which 
binds with PPP1CA and is also manipulated by K141 methylation. Further proteomic 
analysis revealed that the protein lysine methyltransferase suppressor of 
variegation 3-9 homologue 2 (SUV39H2) is responsible for the K141 
mono-methylation of PPP1CA. Targeting SUV39H2 effectively mitigates NPC 
senescence and IDD progression, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for 
IDD intervention.
