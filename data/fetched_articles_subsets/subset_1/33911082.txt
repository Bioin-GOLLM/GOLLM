It is well established that antibiotic treatment selects for resistance, but the 
dynamics of this process during infections are poorly understood. Here we map 
the responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to treatment in high definition during a 
lung infection of a single ICU patient. Host immunity and antibiotic therapy 
with meropenem suppressed P. aeruginosa, but a second wave of infection emerged 
due to the growth of oprD and wbpM meropenem resistant mutants that evolved in 
situ. Selection then led to a loss of resistance by decreasing the prevalence of 
low fitness oprD mutants, increasing the frequency of high fitness mutants 
lacking the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, and decreasing the copy number of a 
multidrug resistance plasmid. Ultimately, host immunity suppressed wbpM mutants 
with high meropenem resistance and fitness. Our study highlights how natural 
selection and host immunity interact to drive both the rapid rise, and fall, of 
resistance during infection.
