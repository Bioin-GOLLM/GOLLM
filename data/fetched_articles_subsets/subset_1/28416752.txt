The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between 
cyclin-dependent kinase Inhibitor-2B (CDKN2B) gene rs1063192 polymorphism and 
glaucoma risk. We searched the databases of PubMed, and Embase. Pooled odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using 
fixed-effect or random-effect models. A total of 14 case-control studies 
involving 11,316 cases and 24,055 controls were included. Meta-analysis showed 
that CDKN2B gene rs1063192 polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of 
glaucoma. Stratification analysis of ethnicity indicated that rs1063192 
polymorphism decreased the risk of glaucoma among Caucasians and Asians. 
Stratification analysis by type of glaucoma revealed that rs1063192 polymorphism 
conferred a protective factor of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and 
non-POAG. Stratification by source of controls uncovered an association between 
rs1063192 polymorphism and glaucoma in groups of population-based controls. In 
conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that CDKN2B gene rs1063192 polymorphism 
is significantly associated with a decreased risk of glaucoma.
