BACKGROUND: Predicting protein levels from genotypes for proteome-wide 
association studies (PWAS) may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying 
cancer susceptibility.
METHODS: We performed PWAS of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers 
and their subtypes in several large European-ancestry discovery consortia 
(effective sample size: 237,483 cases/317,006 controls) and tested the results 
for replication in an independent European-ancestry GWAS (31,969 cases/410,350 
controls). We performed PWAS using the cancer GWAS summary statistics and two 
sets of plasma protein prediction models, followed by colocalization analysis.
RESULTS: Using Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) models, we identified 
93 protein-cancer associations [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. We then 
performed a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication PWAS, resulting in 61 
significant protein-cancer associations (FDR < 0.05). Ten of 15 protein-cancer 
pairs that could be tested using Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) 
protein prediction models replicated with the same directions of effect in both 
cancer GWAS (P < 0.05). To further support our results, we applied Bayesian 
colocalization analysis and found colocalized SNPs for SERPINA3 protein levels 
and prostate cancer (posterior probability, PP = 0.65) and SNUPN protein levels 
and breast cancer (PP = 0.62).
CONCLUSIONS: We used PWAS to identify potential biomarkers of hormone-related 
cancer risk. SNPs in SERPINA3 and SNUPN did not reach genome-wide significance 
for cancer in the original GWAS, highlighting the power of PWAS for novel locus 
discovery, with the added advantage of providing directions of protein effect.
IMPACT: PWAS and colocalization are promising methods to identify potential 
molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits.
