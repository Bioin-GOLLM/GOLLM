Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is essential for somatic 
hypermutation and class switch recombination in mature B-cells, while AID was 
also shown to play a role in developing pre-BCR/BCR-positive B-cells of the bone 
marrow. To further elucidate a potential function of Aid in the bone marrow 
prior to V(D)J-recombination, we utilized an in vivo model which exerts a B-cell 
developmental arrest at the pro-B cell stage with low frequencies of pro-B cell 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pro-B ALL) development. Therefore, 
p19Arf-/-Rag1-/- (AR) mice were crossed with Aid-deficient mice (ARA). 
Surprisingly, loss of Aid expression in pro-B cells accelerated pro-B ALL 
incidence from 30% (AR) to 98% (ARA). This effect was Aid dose dependent, since 
Aid+/- animals of the same background displayed a significantly lower incidence 
(83%). Furthermore, B-cell-specific Aid up-regulation was observed in 
Aid-competent pro-B ALLs. Additional whole exome/sanger sequencing of murine 
pro-B ALLs revealed an accumulation of recurrent somatic Jak3 (p.R653H, p.V670A) 
and Dnm2 (p.G397R) mutations, which highlights the importance of active IL7R 
signaling in the pro-B ALL blast cells. These findings were further supported by 
an enhanced proliferative potential of ARA pro-B cells compared to Aid-competent 
cells from the same genetic background. In summary, we show that both Aid and 
Rag1 act as a negative regulators in pro-B cells, preventing pro-B ALL.
