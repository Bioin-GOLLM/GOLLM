Wang-Bi Capsule (WB), a traditional Chinese medicine- (TCM-) based herbal 
formula, is currently used in clinic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA) with positive clinical effects. However, its pharmacological mechanism of 
action in RA is still obscure. Therefore, this study established a 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model to examine the efficacy of WB by 
using arthritis score, histological analysis, and micro-CT examination. 
Proinflammatory cytokines expression, osteoclast number, OPG/RANKL system, and 
NF-κB activation were then detected to further investigate the mechanism of WB 
in RA treatment. The results indicated that WB could alleviate the erythema and 
swelling of paws in CIA mice. It also inhibited the infiltration of inflammatory 
cells and bone destruction and increased bone density in joints of CIA mice. 
Mechanistic studies showed that WB treatment decreased the production of IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α in serum and joints of CIA mice. Moreover, it reduced the 
osteoclast number, increased OPG level, decreased RANKL level, and inhibited the 
activation of NF-κB in joints of CIA mice. In conclusion, this study 
demonstrated that WB could effectively alleviate disease progression of CIA mice 
by decreasing the IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, modulating the OPG/RANKL 
system, and inhibiting the activation of NF-κB.
