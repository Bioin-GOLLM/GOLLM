BACKGROUND: Congenital absence of vas deferens (CAVD) is a major cause of 
obstructive azoospermia. Mutations in CFTR and ADGRG2 are responsible for this 
disease. However, until now the genetic spectrum of the CFTR and ADGRG2 genes in 
Chinese population and the reasons of the differences from Caucasian cohorts 
were not clear.
OBJECTIVES: (i) To study the characteristic and functional consequences of CFTR 
and ADGRG2 mutations in Chinese CAVD patients. (ii) To describe the genetic 
spectrum of Chinese CAVD patients and explain the reasons of the differences 
from Caucasian cohorts and Chinese cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were screened for mutations in CFTR by Sanger 
sequencing. Patients with only one or no mutations were further investigated by 
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis and direct sequencing 
of ADGRG2 gene. Bioinformatic analysis and structural modeling of proteins were 
performed.
RESULTS: A total of 28 mutations in CFTR were identified in 72 patients, of 
which five mutations were novel. Fifty-five patients (76.39%) had CFTR mutations 
but no indels, among which 80.00% CBAVD patients have at least one CFTR mutation 
and 66.67% CUAVD have at least one CFTR mutation. Two novel mutations (p.Lys818* 
and p.Arg1008Gln) in ADGRG2 were detected. These novel mutations were predicted 
to be damaging by bioinformatics and were absent or extremely low frequency 
among our controls and databases. The genetic spectrum of Chinese CAVD patients 
revealed that the most common mutations were c.1210-12T[5], p.Ile556Val and 
p.Gln1352His, the last two of which were predicted to reduce the domains' 
contacts and weaken adenosine triphosphate binding.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the significance of all exon 
sequencing in CFTR and ADGRG2. A picture of the genetic spectrum of Chinese CAVD 
patients and the most common mutations can be described, which are different 
from Caucasian cohorts and Chinese CF patients.
