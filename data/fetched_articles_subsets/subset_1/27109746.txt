Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a malignant brain tumor of childhood 
that carries an extremely poor prognosis. There are ~200-300 new cases diagnosed 
each year, [1, 2] and little progress has been made in changing the prognosis 
and outcome of the tumor since it was first documented in the literature in 1926 
[3]. The median overall survival is 8-11 months [4], with an overall survival 
rate of 30% at 1 year, and less than 10% at 2 years [4]. This review will 
provide background information on DIPGs, a historical look at the trends in 
caring for DIPG, and current trends in diagnosis and treatment. By changing the 
way we care for these terminal tumors, we can work towards having a better 
understanding of the underlying molecular biology, and attempt to develop better 
chemotherapeutic tools to combat the disease.
