BACKGROUND: Mechanisms involved in metabolic syndrome (MetS) development include 
insulin resistance, weight regulation, inflammation and lipid metabolism. Aim of 
this study is to investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) involved in these mechanisms with MetS.
METHODS: In a random sample of the EPIC-NL study (n = 1886), 38 SNPs associated 
with waist circumference, insulin resistance, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and 
inflammation in genome wide association studies (GWAS) were selected from the 
50K IBC array and one additional SNP was measured with KASPar chemistry. The 
five groups of SNPs, each belonging to one of the metabolic endpoints mentioned 
above, were associated with MetS and MetS-score using Goeman's global test. For 
groups of SNPs significantly associated with the presence of MetS or MetS-score, 
further analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The group of waist circumference SNPs was associated with waist 
circumference (P=0.03) and presence of MetS (P=0.03). Furthermore, the group of 
SNPs related to insulin resistance was associated with MetS score (P<0.01), HDL 
cholesterol (P<0.01), triglycerides (P<0.01) and HbA1C (P=0.04). Subsequent 
analyses showed that MC4R rs17782312, involved in weight regulation, and IRS1 
rs2943634, related to insulin resistance were associated with MetS (OR 1.16, 
95%CI 1.02-1.32 and OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79; 0.97, respectively). The groups of 
inflammation and lipid SNPs were neither associated with presence of MetS nor 
with MetS score.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found support for the hypothesis that weight 
regulation and insulin metabolism are involved in MetS development.MC4R 
rs17782312 and IRS1 rs2943634 may explain part of the genetic variation in MetS.
