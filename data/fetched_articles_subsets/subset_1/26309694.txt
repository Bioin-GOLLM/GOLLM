AIM: In China, the incidence rates of glioma tend to be increased, however, the 
genetic contribution to its etiology is not well-understood. The aim of this 
study is to evaluate the association of XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism with glioma 
risk in a Chinese population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study on 387 patients with 
glioma and 400 cancer-free controls between 2004 and 2014. Peripheral blood 
samples of both groups were processed for DNA extraction and genotyping of the 
XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism using PCR-RFLP. Comparison of the distribution of 
Arg399Gln genotypes in the study groups was performed by means of 2-sided 
contingency tables using the Ï‡(2) test. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by 
Cox proportional hazard regression model.
RESULTS: When the AA genotype was used as the reference group, the GG genotype 
was associated with significantly increased risk for glioma (adjusted OR = 3.18, 
95% CI = 1.38-3.88; P = 0.017). Under the dominant model of inheritance, the AG 
+ GG genotype was associated with significantly increased risk for glioma 
(adjusted OR =2.33, 95% CI = 1.12-5.81; P = 0.023). When the A allele was used 
as the reference group, the G allele was associated with increased glioma risk 
(adjusted OR, 2.44, 95% CI, 1.76-4.18; P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism contribute to 
increased risk of glioma, which may be susceptibility biomarkers for glioma.
