Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a rare, inherited metabolic bone disorder 
characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity and impaired bone 
mineralization. Clinical manifestations and severity of symptoms vary widely in 
HPP, ranging from in utero death to isolated dental manifestations in adults. 
Treatment with enzyme replacement therapy has been reported to improve outcomes 
in perinatal, infantile, and childhood forms of HPP. Here, we present a case of 
a boy with poor linear growth, mild limb bowing, and radiographic rickets who 
was diagnosed with HPP before 6 months of age. Treatment with enzyme replacement 
therapy was initiated at 7 months of age, after which significant improvements 
in radiographic findings and linear growth were demonstrated. This case 
highlights several important challenges in the diagnosis, classification, and 
management of HPP.
