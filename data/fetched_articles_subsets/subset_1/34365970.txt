BACKGROUND: Age-associated changes attenuate human blood system functionality 
through the aging of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), manifested 
in human populations an increase in myeloproliferative disease and even 
leukemia; therefore, study on HSPC senescence bears great significance to treat 
hematopoietic-associated disease. Furthermore, the mechanism of HSPC aging is 
lacking, especially the cellular memory mechanism. Here, we not only reported a 
new HSPC senescence model in vitro, but also propose and verify the cellular 
memory mechanism of HSPC aging of the Polycomb/Trithorax system.
METHODS: HSPCs (Lin-c-kit+ cells) were isolated and purified by magnetic cell 
sorting (MACS). The proportions and cell cycle distribution of cells were 
determined by flow cytometry; senescence-related β-galactosidase assay, 
transmission electron microscope (TEM), and colony-forming unit (CFU)-mix assay 
were detected for identification of the old HSPC model. Proteomic tests and 
RNA-seq were applied to analyze differential pathways and genes in the model 
cells. qPCR, Western blot (WB), and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR (CHIP-PCR) 
were used to detect the gene expression of cell memory-related proteins. 
Knockdown of cell memory-related key genes was performed with shRNA 
interference.
RESULTS: In the model old HSPCs, β-gal activity, cell cycle, colony-forming 
ability, aging-related cell morphology, and metabolic pathway were significantly 
changed compared to the young HSPCs. Furthermore, we found the model HSPCs have 
more obvious aging manifestations than those of natural mice, and IL3 is the 
major factor contributing to HSPC aging in the model. We also observed dramatic 
changes in the expression level of PRC/TrxG complexes. After further exploring 
the downstream molecules of PRC/TrxG complexes, we found that Uhrf1 and TopII 
played critical roles in HSPC aging based on the HSPC senescence model.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings proposed a new HSPC senescence model in vitro which 
we forecasted could be used to preliminary screen the drugs of the HSPC 
aging-related hemopathy and suggested cellular memory mechanism of HSPC aging.
