Cellular senescence has long been used as a cellular model for understanding 
mechanisms underlying the ageing process. Compelling evidence obtained in recent 
years demonstrate that DNA damage is a common mediator for both replicative 
senescence, which is triggered by telomere shortening, and premature cellular 
senescence induced by various stressors such as oncogenic stress and oxidative 
stress. Extensive observations suggest that DNA damage accumulates with age and 
that this may be due to an increase in production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and a decline in DNA repair capacity with age. Mutation or disrupted 
expression of genes that increase DNA damage often result in premature ageing. 
In contrast, interventions that enhance resistance to oxidative stress and 
attenuate DNA damage contribute towards longevity. This evidence suggests that 
genomic instability plays a causative role in the ageing process. However, 
conflicting findings exist which indicate that ROS production and oxidative 
damage levels of macromolecules including DNA do not always correlate with 
lifespan in model animals. Here we review the recent advances in addressing the 
role of DNA damage in cellular senescence and organismal ageing.
