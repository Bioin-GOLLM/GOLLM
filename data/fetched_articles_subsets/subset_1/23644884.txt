The special class IIb histone deacetylase, HDAC6, plays a prominent role in many 
cellular processes related to cancer, including oncogenesis, the cell stress 
response, motility, and myriad signaling pathways. Many of the lessons learned 
from other cancers can be applied to ovarian cancer as well. HDAC6 interacts 
with diverse proteins such as HSP90, cortactin, tubulin, dynein, p300, Bax, and 
GRK2 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm to carry out these cancerous functions. 
Not all pro-cancer interactions of HDAC6 involve deacetylation. The idea of 
using HDAC6 as a target for cancer treatment continues to expand in recent 
years, and more potent and specific HDAC6 inhibitors are required to effectively 
down-regulate the tumor-prone cell signaling pathways responsible for ovarian 
cancer.
