INTRODUCTION: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) may contribute to the excess 
cardiovascular burden observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The prevalence and 
associations of the MetS in RA remain uncertain: systemic inflammation and 
anti-rheumatic therapy may contribute. Methotrexate (MTX) use has recently been 
linked to a reduced presence of MetS, via an assumed generic anti-inflammatory 
mechanism. We aimed to: assess the prevalence of the MetS in RA; identify 
factors that associate with its presence; and assess their interaction with the 
potential influence of MTX.
METHODS: MetS prevalence was assessed cross-sectionally in 400 RA patients, 
using five MetS definitions (National Cholesterol Education Programme 2004 and 
2001, International Diabetes Federation, World Health Organisation and European 
Group for Study of Insulin Resistance). Logistic regression was used to identify 
independent predictors of the MetS. Further analysis established the nature of 
the association between MTX and the MetS.
RESULTS: MetS prevalence rates varied from 12.1% to 45.3% in RA according to the 
definition used. Older age and higher HAQ scores associated with the presence of 
the MetS. MTX use, but not other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 
or glucocorticoids, associated with significantly reduced chance of having the 
MetS in RA (OR = 0.517, CI 0.33-0.81, P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the MetS in RA varies according to the definition 
used. MTX therapy, unlike other DMARDs or glucocorticoids, independently 
associates with a reduced propensity to MetS, suggesting a drug-specific 
mechanism, and makes MTX a good first-line DMARD in RA patients at high risk of 
developing the MetS, particularly those aged over 60 years.
