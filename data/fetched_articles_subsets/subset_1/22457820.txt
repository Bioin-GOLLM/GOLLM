Prostate cancer susceptibility has previously been associated with truncating 
germline variants in the gene TP53AIP1 (tumor protein p53 regulated apoptosis 
inducing protein 1). For two apparently recurrent mutations (p.Q22fs and p.S32X) 
a remarkable OR of 5.1 was reported for prostate cancer risk. Since these 
findings have not been validated so far, we genotyped p.Q22fs and p.S32X in two 
German series with a total of 1,207 prostate cancer cases and 1,495 controls. 
The truncating variants were not significantly associated with prostate cancer 
in none of the two cohorts, nor in the combined analysis [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI 95%) = 0.62-2.15; p = 0.66]. Carriers 
showed no significant differences in family history of prostate cancer, age at 
diagnosis, Gleason score or PSA at diagnosis when compared to non-carrier 
prostate cancer cases. The large sample size of the combined cohort rejects a 
high-risk effect greater than 2.2 and indicates a limited role of TP53AIP1 in 
prostate cancer predisposition.
