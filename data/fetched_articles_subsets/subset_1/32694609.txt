Plasticity of cancer metabolism can be a major obstacle to efficient targeting 
of tumour-specific metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we identify the compensatory 
mechanisms following the inhibition of major pathways of central carbon 
metabolism in c-MYC-induced liver tumours. We find that, while inhibition of 
both glutaminase isoforms (Gls1 and Gls2) in tumours considerably delays 
tumourigenesis, glutamine catabolism continues, owing to the action of 
amidotransferases. Synergistic inhibition of both glutaminases and compensatory 
amidotransferases is required to block glutamine catabolism and proliferation of 
mouse and human tumour cells in vitro and in vivo. Gls1 deletion is also 
compensated for by glycolysis. Thus, co-inhibition of Gls1 and hexokinase 2 
significantly affects Krebs cycle activity and tumour formation. Finally, the 
inhibition of biosynthesis of either serine (Psat1-KO) or fatty acid (Fasn-KO) 
is compensated for by uptake of circulating nutrients, and dietary restriction 
of both serine and glycine or fatty acids synergistically suppresses 
tumourigenesis. These results highlight the high flexibility of tumour 
metabolism and demonstrate that either pharmacological or dietary targeting of 
metabolic compensatory mechanisms can improve therapeutic outcomes.
