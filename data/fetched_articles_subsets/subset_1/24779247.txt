OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) 
and factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, and C677T methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR) mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted on 95 consecutive 
cases with RPL, and 40 age-matched controls who had no history of pregnancy loss 
and had at least one successful pregnancy. After application of exclusion 
criteria, 60 patients in the study group and 40 control cases were compared for 
thrombophilic factors.
RESULTS: Thirteen out of 60 RPL cases and one out of 40 in the control group 
were carriers of factor V Leiden mutation. While six patients were carriers of 
prothrombin G20210A gene mutation, none in the control group carried this 
mutation. Twenty-nine out of 60 RPL cases and 17 out of 40 control cases had 
MTHFR mutation.
CONCLUSION: The authors found a positive correlation between RPL and FVL and FII 
gene mutations, but no significant association between RPL and MTHFR gene 
mutation.
