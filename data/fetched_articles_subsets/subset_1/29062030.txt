Staphylococcus aureus is a medically important pathogen with an abundance of 
virulence factors that are necessary for survival within a host, including the 
production of cytolytic toxins. The regulation of toxin production is mediated 
by the Agr quorum sensing system, and a poorly defined post-exponential growth 
phase signal independent of Agr. As part of a recent genome wide association 
study (GWAS) to identify novel loci that alter the expression of cytolytic 
toxins, a polymorphism in the cyoE gene, which encodes a protoheme IX 
farnesyltransferase, was identified. This enzyme is essential for processing 
heme into the electron transport chain for use as an electron acceptor. 
Interestingly, without this enzyme S. aureus were repressed in their ability to 
secrete cytolytic toxins, and this appears to be mediated through repression of 
the Agr quorum sensing system. We hypothesize that the loss of electron 
transport is inducing feedback inhibition of metabolic capabilities that 
suppress the TCA cycle, and that this coupled with decreased RNAIII 
transcription prevents synthesis of cytolytic toxins.
