Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are common among patients with Parkinson's disease 
(PD). However, reports on NMS in Chinese PD population are scarce. Little is 
known about NMS in patients with Asian specific leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 
(LRRK2) variants in G2385R and R1628P. This study aimed to elucidate the 
clinical characteristics of NMS in Chinese PD patients and to ascertain if there 
were differences in NMS between PD patients with and without LRRK2 variants. A 
multicenter, observational study was conducted with 1,225 sporadic PD (sPD) 
patients recruited from a PD cohort of the Chinese National Consortium on 
neurodegenerative diseases, 163 participants had the LRRK2 variants. The 
Non-motor Symptom Questionnaire (NMSQ) was used to screen for the presence of 
NMS. This study found the majority of sPD patients (97.6 %) had at least one 
NMS. A mean of 8.72 NMS (SD = 5.43) was reported per patient. Forgetfulness, 
constipation and daytime sleepiness were found to be the most frequent NMS. 
Moreover, the number of NMS was positively correlated with the age, disease 
duration, Hoehn & Yahr stage and the motor scores of the unified Parkinson's 
disease rating scale. Although no discrepancy was found in the number of NMS 
between sPD patients with and without LRRK2 variants, nocturia was less common 
in LRRK2 variants carriers than in non-carriers (P = 0.045). NMS appear to be 
prevalent in Chinese sPD population. There are no differences in the NMS 
phenotype between LRRK2 and no LRRK2 patients.
