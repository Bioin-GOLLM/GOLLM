BACKGROUND: In 2006, we found healthy subjects carrying ST131 Escherichia coli 
in their intestinal microbiota consisting of two populations: a subdominant 
population of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli belonging to subclone H30 (H30-R 
or subclade C1), the current worldwide dominant ST131 subclone, and a dominant 
E. coli population composed of antibiotic-susceptible E. coli belonging to 
subclone H22 (clade B), the precursor of subclone H30. We sequenced the whole 
genome of fecal H22 strain S250, compared it to the genomes of ExPEC ST131 
H30-Rx strain JJ1886 and commensal ST131 H41 strain SE15, sought the H22-H30 
genomic differences in our fecal strains and assessed their phenotypic 
consequences.
RESULTS: We detected 173 genes found in the Virulence Factor Database, of which 
148 were shared by the three ST131 genomes, whereas some were genome-specific, 
notably those allowing determination of virotype (D for S250 and C for JJ1886). 
We found three sequences of the FimH site involved in adhesion: two in S250 and 
SE15 close and identical, respectively, to that previously reported to confer 
strong intestinal adhesion, and one in JJ1886, corresponding to that commonly 
present in uropathogenic E. coli. Among the genes involved in sugar metabolism, 
one encoding a gluconate kinase lacked in S250 and JJ1886. Although this gene 
was also absent in both our fecal H22 and H30-R strains, H22 strains showed a 
higher capacity to grow in minimal medium with gluconate. Among the genes 
involved in gluconate metabolism, only the ghrB gene differed between S250/H22 
and JJ1886/H30-R strains, resulting in different gluconate reductases. Of the 
genes involved in biofilm formation, two were absent in the three genomes and 
one, fimB, in the JJ1886 genome. Our fecal H30-R strains lacking intact fimB 
displayed delayed biofilm formation relative to our fecal H22 strains. The H22 
strains differed by subclade B type and plasmid content, whereas the H30-R 
strains were identical.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic analysis of our fecal strains based on observed genomic 
differences between S250 and JJ1886 strains suggests the presence of traits 
related to bacterial commensalism in our H22 strains and traits commonly found 
in uropathogenic E. coli in our H30-R strains.
