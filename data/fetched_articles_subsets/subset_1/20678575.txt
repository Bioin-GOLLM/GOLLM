The SNARE-binding protein complexin (Cpx) has been demonstrated to regulate 
synaptic vesicle fusion. Previous studies are consistent with Cpx functioning 
either as a synaptic vesicle fusion clamp to prevent premature exocytosis, or as 
a facilitator to directly stimulate release. Here we examined conserved roles of 
invertebrate and mammalian Cpx isoforms in the regulation of neurotransmitter 
release using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction as a model synapse. We find 
that SNARE binding by Cpx is required for its role as a fusion clamp. All four 
mammalian Cpx proteins (mCpx), which have been demonstrated to facilitate 
release, also function as fusion clamps when expressed in Drosophila cpx null 
mutants, though their clamping abilities vary between isoforms. Moreover, 
expression of mCpx I, II or III isoforms dramatically enhance evoked release 
compared to mCpx IV or Drosophila Cpx. Differences in the clamping and 
facilitating properties of complexin isoforms can be partially attributed to 
differences in the C-terminal membrane tethering domain. Our findings indicate 
that the function of complexins as fusion clamps and facilitators of fusion are 
conserved across evolution, and that these roles are genetically separable 
within an isoform and across different isoforms.
