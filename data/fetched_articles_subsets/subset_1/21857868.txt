The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol and progesterone, and their nuclear 
receptors (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]), are involved 
in breast cancer development. As ER-positive/PR-positive tumors progress, they 
are likely to become steroid hormone-resistant/independent, yet often retain 
expression of their steroid receptors. Notably, up to 40% of women with steroid 
receptor-positive tumors exhibit de novo resistance or eventually fail on 
estrogen- or ERÎ±-blocking therapies (acquired resistance). Indeed, most of the 
research on this topic has centered on mechanisms of ER 'escape' from endocrine 
therapy and the design of better ER-blocking strategies; signaling pathways that 
mediate endocrine (i.e., anti-estrogen) resistance are also excellent 
therapeutic targets. However, serious consideration of PR isoforms as important 
drivers of early breast cancer progression and ER modulators is timely and 
significant. Indeed, progress has been hindered by ER-centric experimental 
approaches. This article will focus on defining a role for PR in breast cancer 
with hopes of providing a refreshing PR-focused perspective.
