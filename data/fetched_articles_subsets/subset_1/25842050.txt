The occurrence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs) is common in 
Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) but is 
of unknown significance in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. We 
retrospectively analyzed data from a consecutive case series of adults with Ph+ 
ALL who had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) at 
City of Hope between 2003 and 2014. Among 130 adults with Ph+ ALL who had TKI 
therapy before alloHCT, 78 patients had available data on conventional 
cytogenetics at diagnosis and were eligible for outcomes analysis. ACAs were 
observed in 41 patients (53%). There were no statistically significant 
differences in median age, median initial WBC count, post-HCT TKI maintenance, 
or disease status at the time of transplant between the Ph-only and ACA cohorts; 
however, the Ph-only cohort had a higher rate of minimal residual disease 
positivity at the time of HCT. Three-year leukemia-free survival (79.8% versus 
39.5%, P = .01) and 3-year overall survival (83% versus 45.6%, P = .02) were 
superior in the Ph-only cohort compared with the ACA cohort, respectively. 
Monosomy 7 was the most common additional aberration observed in our ACA cohort 
(n = 12). Thus, when TKI therapy and alloHCT are used as part of adult Ph+ ALL 
therapy, the presence of ACAs appears to have a significant deleterious effect 
on outcomes post-HCT.
