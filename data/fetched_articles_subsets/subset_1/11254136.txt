The yeast a-factor transporter Ste6 is a member of the ABC transporter family 
and is closely related to human MDR1. We constructed a set of 26 Ste6 mutants 
using a random mutagenesis approach. Cell fractionation experiments demonstrated 
that most of the mutants, with the notable exception of those with alterations 
in TM1, are transported to the plasma membrane, the presumptive site of action 
of Ste6. Trafficking, therefore, does not seem to be affected in most of the 
mutants. To identify regions in Ste6 that interact with the ABC transporter 
"signature motif" (LSGGQ) we screened for intragenic revertants of the LSGGQ 
mutant M68 (S507N). Suppressor mutations were identified in TM12 and upstream of 
TM6. Surprisingly, these mutations also suppressed the Walker A mutation G397D, 
which should be defective in ATP-binding and hydrolysis at NBD1. Photoaffinity 
labeling experiments with 8-azido-[alpha-32P]ATP showed that ATP binding at NBD2 
is reduced by the suppressor mutation in TM12. The experiments further suggest 
that the two NBDs of Ste6 are not equivalent and affect each other's ability to 
bind and hydrolyze ATP.
