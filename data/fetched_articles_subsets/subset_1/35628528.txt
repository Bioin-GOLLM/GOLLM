Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and specifically, diabetic 
kidney disease (DKD) occurs in up to 30% of all diabetic patients. Kidney 
disease attributed to diabetes is a major contributor to the global burden of 
the disease in terms of clinical and socio-economic impact, not only because of 
the risk of progression to End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD), but also because of 
the associated increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk. Despite the introduction of 
novel treatments that allow us to reduce the risk of future outcomes, a striking 
residual cardiorenal risk has been reported. This risk is explained by both the 
heterogeneity of DKD and the individual variability in response to 
nephroprotective treatments. Strategies that have been proposed to improve DKD 
patient care are to develop novel biomarkers that classify with greater accuracy 
patients with respect to their future risk (prognostic) and biomarkers that are 
able to predict the response to nephroprotective treatment (predictive). In this 
review, we summarize the principal prognostic biomarkers of type 1 and type 2 
diabetes and the novel markers that help clinicians to individualize treatments 
and the basis of the characteristics that predict an optimal response.
