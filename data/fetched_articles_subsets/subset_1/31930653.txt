Cancer is a major health problem worldwide. An increasing number of researchers 
are studying the diagnosis, therapy and mechanisms underlying the development 
and progression of cancer. The study of noncoding RNA has attracted a lot of 
attention in recent years. It was found that frequent alterations of miRNA 
expression not only have various functions in cancer but also that miRNAs can 
act as clinical markers of diagnosis, stage and progression of cancer. MiR-212 
is an important example of miRNAs involved in cancer. According to recent 
studies, miR-212 may serve as an oncogene or tumour suppressor by influencing 
different targets or pathways during the oncogenesis and the development and 
metastasis of cancer. Its deregulation may serve as a marker for the diagnosis 
or prognosis of cancer. In addition, it was recently reported that miR-212 was 
related to the sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy. Here, we summarize the current understanding of miR-212 functions 
in cancer by describing the relevant signalling pathways and targets. The role 
of miR-212 as a biomarker and its therapeutic potential in cancer is also 
described. The aim of this review was to identify new methods for the diagnosis 
and treatment of human cancers.
