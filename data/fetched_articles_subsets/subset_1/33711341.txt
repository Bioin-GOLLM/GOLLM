The helical morphology of Campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium involved in host gut 
colonization and pathogenesis in humans, is determined by the structure of the 
peptidoglycan (PG) layer. This structure is dictated by trimming of peptide 
stems by the LD-carboxypeptidase Pgp2 within the periplasm. The interaction 
interface between Pgp2 and PG to select sites for peptide trimming is unknown. 
We determined a 1.6 Å resolution crystal structure of Pgp2, which contains a 
conserved LD-carboxypeptidase domain and a previously uncharacterized domain 
with an NTF2-like fold (NTF2). We identified a pocket in the NTF2 domain formed 
by conserved residues and located ∼40 Å from the LD-carboxypeptidase active 
site. Expression of pgp2 in trans with substitutions of charged (Lys257, Lys307, 
Glu324) and hydrophobic residues (Phe242 and Tyr233) within the pocket did not 
restore helical morphology to a pgp2 deletion strain. Muropeptide analysis 
indicated a decrease of murotripeptides in the deletion strain expressing these 
mutants, suggesting reduced Pgp2 catalytic activity. Pgp2 but not the K307A 
mutant was pulled down by C. jejuni Δpgp2 PG sacculi, supporting a role for the 
pocket in PG binding. NMR spectroscopy was used to define the interaction 
interfaces of Pgp2 with several PG fragments, which bound to the active site 
within the LD-carboxypeptidase domain and the pocket of the NTF2 domain. We 
propose a model for Pgp2 binding to PG strands involving both the 
LD-carboxypeptidase domain and the accessory NTF2 domain to induce a helical 
cell shape.
