Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common birth defect predominantly affecting the 
forebrain and face and has been linked to mutations in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) 
gene. HPE is genetically heterogeneous, and clinical presentation represents a 
spectrum of phenotypes. We have previously shown that Gas1 encodes a 
cell-autonomous Hedgehog signaling enhancer. Combining cell surface binding, in 
vitro activity, and explant culture assays, we provide evidence that SHH 
contains a previously unknown unique binding surface for its interaction with 
GAS1 and that this surface is also important for maximal signaling activity. 
Within this surface, the Asn-115 residue of human SHH has been documented to 
associate with HPE when mutated to lysine (N115K). We provide evidence that HPE 
associated with this mutation can be mechanistically explained by a severely 
reduced binding of SHH to GAS1, and we predict a similar result if a mutation 
were to occur at Tyr-80. Our data should encourage future searches for mutations 
in GAS1 as possible modifiers contributing to the wide spectrum of HPE.
