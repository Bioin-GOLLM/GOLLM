Mitochondrial genome content and structure vary widely across the eukaryotic 
tree of life, with protists displaying extreme examples. Apicomplexan and 
dinoflagellate protists have evolved highly reduced mitochondrial genome 
sequences, mtDNA, consisting of only three cytochrome genes and fragmented rRNA 
genes. Here, we report the independent evolution of fragmented cytochrome genes 
in Toxoplasma and related tissue coccidia and evolution of a novel genome 
architecture consisting minimally of 21 sequence blocks (SBs) totaling 5.9 kb 
that exist as nonrandom concatemers. Single-molecule Nanopore reads consisting 
entirely of SBs ranging from 0.1 to 23.6 kb reveal both whole and fragmented 
cytochrome genes. Full-length cytochrome transcripts including a divergent 
coxIII are detected. The topology of the mitochondrial genome remains an enigma. 
Analysis of a cob point mutation reveals that homoplasmy of SBs is maintained. 
Tissue coccidia are important pathogens of man and animals, and the 
mitochondrion represents an important therapeutic target. The mtDNA sequence has 
been elucidated, but a definitive genome architecture remains elusive.
