The mechanisms by which immune checkpoint blockade modulates tumor evolution 
during therapy are unclear. We assessed genomic changes in tumors from 68 
patients with advanced melanoma, who progressed on ipilimumab or were 
ipilimumab-naive, before and after nivolumab initiation (CA209-038 study). 
Tumors were analyzed by whole-exome, transcriptome, and/or T cell receptor (TCR) 
sequencing. In responding patients, mutation and neoantigen load were reduced 
from baseline, and analysis of intratumoral heterogeneity during therapy 
demonstrated differential clonal evolution within tumors and putative selection 
against neoantigenic mutations on-therapy. Transcriptome analyses before and 
during nivolumab therapy revealed increases in distinct immune cell subsets, 
activation of specific transcriptional networks, and upregulation of immune 
checkpoint genes that were more pronounced in patients with response. Temporal 
changes in intratumoral TCR repertoire revealed expansion of T cell clones in 
the setting of neoantigen loss. Comprehensive genomic profiling data in this 
study provide insight into nivolumab's mechanism of action.
