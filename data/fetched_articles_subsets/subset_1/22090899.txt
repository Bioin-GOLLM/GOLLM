The asymmetric unit of the title compound, {(C(9)H(14)N)(3)[CdCl(5)]}(n), 
comprises three 2,4,6-trimethyl-aniline dications and one half of the 
[Cd(2)Cl(10)](6-) anion. The Cd atoms are each coordinated by six Cl atoms, with 
octa-hedra linked by bridging, apical Cl atoms, forming linear chains running 
parallel to the a axis. The trimethylanilinium cations form stacks between the 
chains of CdCl(6) octa-hedra.
