Aldose reductase is a key enzyme in the development of long term diabetic 
complications and its inhibition represents a viable therapeutic solution for 
people affected by these pathologies. Therefore, the search for effective aldose 
reductase inhibitors is a timely and pressing challenge. Herein we describe the 
access to a novel class of oxyimino derivatives, obtained by reaction of a 
1,5-dicarbonyl substrate with O-(arylmethyl)hydroxylamines. The synthesised 
compounds proved to be active against the target enzyme. The best performing 
inhibitor, compound (Z)-8, proved also to reduce both cell death and the 
apoptotic process when tested in an inÂ vitro model of diabetic retinopathy made 
of photoreceptor-like 661w cell line exposed to high-glucose medium, 
counteracting oxidative stress triggered by hyperglycaemic conditions.
