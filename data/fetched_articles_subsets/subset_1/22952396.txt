Growth factors and oncogenic kinases play important roles in stimulating cell 
growth during development and transformation. These processes have significant 
energetic and synthetic requirements and it is apparent that a central function 
of growth signals is to promote glucose metabolism to support these demands. 
Because metabolic pathways represent a fundamental aspect of cell proliferation 
and survival, there is considerable interest in targeting metabolism as a means 
to eliminate cancer. A challenge, however, is that molecular links between 
metabolic stress and cell death are poorly understood. Here we review current 
literature on how cells cope with metabolic stress and how autophagy, apoptosis, 
and necrosis are tightly linked to cell metabolism. Ultimately, understanding of 
the interplay between nutrients, autophagy, and cell death will be a key 
component in development of new treatment strategies to exploit the altered 
metabolism of cancer cells.
