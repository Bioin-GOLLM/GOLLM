BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction has been associated to cardiovascular 
outcomes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Circulating endothelial 
progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important physiological role for their 
reparative potential of vascular integrity, but are numerically reduced and 
functionally impaired in patients with cardiovascular risks. This study assesses 
the effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and apple-enriched dark chocolate 
intake on the blood levels of EPCs. Methods: Thirty volunteers with 
cardiovascular risk factors, enrolled in a randomised, crossover, four-weeks 
trial, received a solid dark chocolate bar (40 g/day) containing 10% EVOO or 
2.5% dry apples. Urine samples were analyzed for endogenous metabolites. 
Circulating EPCs levels, clinical data and anthropometric examinations were 
collected.
RESULTS: 26 volunteers (M/F:14/12, 51 Â± 9 years of age) completed the study. 
Comparison of pre-post intervention revealed a significant increase in EPCs 
levels associated with EVOO-dark chocolate consumption. Most biochemical 
parameters were not significantly modified by both chocolates.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a daily consumption of a non fattening dose 
of dark chocolate enriched with EVOO improves blood levels of EPCs, a well known 
surrogate biologic marker for endothelial function.
