Globins have been studied as model proteins to elucidate the principles of 
protein evolution. This was achieved by understanding the relationship between 
amino acid sequence, three-dimensional structure, physicochemical properties, 
and physiological function. Previous molecular phylogenies of chordate globin 
genes revealed the monophyletic evolution of urochordate globins and suggested 
convergent evolution. However, to provide evidence of convergent evolution, it 
is necessary to determine the physicochemical and functional similarities 
between vertebrates and urochordate globins. In this study, we determined the 
expression patterns of Ciona globin genes using real-time RT-PCR. Two genes 
(Gb-1 and Gb-2) were predominantly expressed in the branchial sac, heart, and 
hemocytes and were induced under hypoxia. Combined with the sequence analysis, 
our findings suggest that Gb-1/-2 correspond to vertebrate hemoglobin-α/-β. 
However, we did not find a robust similarity between Gb-3, Gb-4, and vertebrate 
globins. These results suggested that, even though Ciona globins obtained their 
unique functions differently from vertebrate globins, the two of them shared 
some physicochemical features and physiological functions. Our findings offer a 
good example for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying gene 
co-option and convergence, which could lead to evolutionary innovations.
