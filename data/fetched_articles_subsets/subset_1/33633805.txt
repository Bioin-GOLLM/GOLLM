An imbalance in microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression is closely associated with 
tumorigenesis and progression. miR-206 is downregulated in different types of 
tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the effects of miR-206 on 
the progression of CRC, and its underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be 
elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of miR-206 on the 
proliferation, migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, and determine 
its potential molecular mechanism. The results of the present study demonstrated 
that the expression levels of miR-206 and c-Met were affected in HCT116 and 
SW480 cells by transfected with miR-206 mimic, inhibitor or small interfering 
RNA-c-Met. A Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the miRNA 
targets. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays were also performed. 
The results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-206 significantly decreased 
the viability of HCT116 and SW480 cells. The results of the Transwell assay 
indicated that the cell migratory and invasive abilities were inhibited 
following transfection with miR-206 mimic. As a target of miR-206, knockdown of 
c-Met significantly suppressed cell viability, migration and invasion. In 
addition, c-Met knockdown or overexpression of miR-206 inhibited activation of 
the AKT/GSK-3β pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that miR-206 
suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells by targeting 
the c-Met/AKT/GSK-3β pathway.
