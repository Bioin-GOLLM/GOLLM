Gain-of-function variants in the stimulator of interferon response cGAMP 
interactor 1 (STING1) gene cause STING-Associated Vasculopathy with onset in 
Infancy (SAVI). Previously, only heterozygous and mostly de novo STING1 variants 
have been reported to cause SAVI. Interestingly, one variant that only leads to 
SAVI when homozygous, namely c.841C>T p.(Arg281Trp), has recently been 
described. However, there are no entries in public databases regarding an 
autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Here, we report four additional 
unrelated SAVI patients carrying c.841C>T in homozygous state. All patients had 
interstitial lung disease and displayed typical interferon activation patterns. 
Only one child displayed cutaneous vasculitis, while three other patients 
presented with a relatively mild SAVI phenotype. Steroid and baricitinib 
treatment had a mitigating effect on the disease phenotype in two cases, but 
failed to halt disease progression. Heterozygous c.841C>T carriers in our 
analysis were healthy and showed normal interferon activation. Literature review 
identified eight additional cases with autosomal recessive SAVI caused by 
c.841C>T homozygosity. In summary, we present four novel and eight historic 
cases of autosomal recessive SAVI. We provide comprehensive clinical data and 
show treatment regimens and clinical responses. To date, SAVI has been listed as 
an exclusively autosomal dominant inherited trait in relevant databases. With 
this report, we aim to raise awareness for autosomal recessive inheritance in 
this rare, severe disease which may aid in early diagnosis and development of 
optimized treatment strategies.
