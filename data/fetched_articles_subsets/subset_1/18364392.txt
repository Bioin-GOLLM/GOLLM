OBJECTIVE: Carbohydrate counting is an effective approach to mealtime insulin 
adjustment in type 1 diabetes but has not been rigorously assessed in type 2 
diabetes. We sought to compare an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio with a simple 
algorithm for adjusting the dose of prandial insulin glusiline.
RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS: This 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled 
study compared two algorithms for adjusting mealtime (glulisine) insulin along 
with a standard algorithm for adjusting background (glargine) insulin in 273 
intent-to-treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Glulisine and glargine were 
adjusted weekly in both groups based on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) 
results from the previous week. The simple algorithm group was provided set 
doses of glulisine to take before each meal. The carbohydrate counting (carb 
count) group was provided an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio to use for each meal 
and adjusted their glulisine dose based on the amount of carbohydrate consumed.
RESULTS: A1C levels at week 24 were 6.70% (simple algorithm) and 6.54% (carb 
count). The respective mean A1C changes from baseline to 24 weeks were -1.46 and 
-1.59% (P = 0.24). A1C <7.0% was achieved by 73.2% (simple algorithm) and 69.2% 
(carb count) (P = 0.70) of subjects; respective values for A1C <6.5% were 44.3 
and 49.5% (P = 0.28). The total daily dose of insulin was lower, and there was a 
trend toward less weight gain in carb count group patients. Severe hypoglycemia 
rates were low and equal in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Weekly basal-bolus insulin adjustments based on premeal and bedtime 
glucose patterns resulted in significant reductions in A1C. Having two effective 
approaches to delivering and adjusting rapid-acting mealtime insulin may 
increase physicians' and patients' willingness to advance therapy to a 
basal-bolus insulin regimen.
