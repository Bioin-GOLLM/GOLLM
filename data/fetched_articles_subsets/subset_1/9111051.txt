Shiga toxin consists of an enzymatically active A-chain and a pentameric binding 
subunit. The A-chain has a trypsin-sensitive region, and upon cleavage two 
disulfide bonded fragments, A1 and A2, are generated. To study the role of the 
disulfide bond, it was eliminated by mutating cysteine 242 to serine. In T47D 
cells this mutated toxin was more toxic than wild type toxin after a short 
incubation, whereas after longer incubation times wild type toxin was most 
toxic. Cells cleaved not only wild type but also mutated A-chain into A1 and A2 
fragments. The mutated A-chain was more sensitive than wild type toxin to 
Pronase, and it was degraded at a higher rate in T47D cells. Subcellular 
fractionation demonstrated transport of both wild type and mutated toxin to the 
Golgi apparatus. Brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi apparatus, protected not 
only against Shiga toxin but also against the mutated toxin, indicating 
involvement of the Golgi apparatus. After prebinding of Shiga(C242S) toxin to 
wells coated with the Shiga toxin receptor, Gb3, trypsin treatment induced 
dissociation of A1 from the toxin-receptor complex demonstrating that in 
addition to stabilizing the A-chain, the disulfide bond prevents dissociation of 
the A1 fragment from the toxin-receptor complex.
