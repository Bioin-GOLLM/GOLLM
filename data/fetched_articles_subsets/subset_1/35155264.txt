Ferroptosis is a novel characterized form of cell death featured with 
iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, which is distinct from any known programmed 
cell death in the biological processes and morphological characteristics. Recent 
evidence points out that ferroptosis is correlated with numerous metabolic 
pathways, including iron homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and redox homeostasis, 
associating with the occurrence and treatment of hematological malignancies, 
such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. Nowadays, utilizing 
ferroptosis as the target to prevent and treat hematological malignancies has 
become an active and challenging topic of research, and the regulatory network 
and physiological function of ferroptosis also need to be further elucidated. 
This review will summarize the recent progress in the molecular regulation of 
ferroptosis and the physiological roles and therapeutic potential of ferroptosis 
as the target in hematological malignancies.
