Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting autosomal recessive condition 
in Australia. A defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator protein affects chloride transport across epithelial cells. Patients 
with cystic fibrosis produce thick sticky mucus. This causes problems in 
multiple organs, particularly the lungs. Cystic fibrosis modulator therapies can 
partially correct the underlying pathophysiology and improve chloride transport, 
thereby improving morbidity. Life expectancy is improving, so many patients are 
now developing chronic diseases associated with ageing. All health professionals 
should be aware that the cystic fibrosis modulator therapies are metabolised via 
cytochrome P450 pathways in the liver. There are therefore significant drug-drug 
interactions with medicines metabolised by the same pathways.
