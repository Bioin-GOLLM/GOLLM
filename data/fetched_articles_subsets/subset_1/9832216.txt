Clinical observations indicate that a proportion of patients with schizophrenia 
experience cognitive impairment, which suggests that a neurodegenerative basis 
might be involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), 
which has been confirmed to be genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease, 
is thus highlighted as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. Recently, novel 
functional polymorphisms in the ApoE transcriptional regulatory region have been 
found. To investigate whether these polymorphisms are associated with the risk 
of schizophrenia, we genotyped 144 patients with schizophrenia and 134 controls 
for two polymorphisms (-491A/T and -219G/T). No significant positive 
associations between both polymorphisms and schizophrenia were observed. Our 
findings exclude the regulatory region of the ApoE gene as a locus that might 
confer increased susceptibility to schizophrenia.
