Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are classified by the World 
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as causes of devastating avian diseases. 
This study aimed to develop type IIb Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin 
(LTIIb) as novel mucosal adjuvants for mucosal vaccine development. The fusion 
protein of H5 and LTIIb-A subunit was expressed and purified for mouse and 
chicken intranasal immunizations. Intranasal immunization with the H5-LTIIb-A 
fusion protein in mice elicited potent neutralizing antibodies in sera and 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, induced stronger Th1 and Th17 cellular responses 
in spleen and cervical lymph nodes, and improved protection against H5N1 
influenza virus challenge. More interestingly, intranasal immunization with the 
H5-LTIIb-A fusion protein in chickens elicited high titers of IgY, IgA, 
hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI), and neutralizing antibodies in their antisera. 
This study employed the novel adjuvants of LTIIb for the development of a new 
generation of mucosal vaccines against highly pathogenic avian influenza 
viruses.
