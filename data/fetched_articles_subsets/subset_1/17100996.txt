We describe three families with X-linked mental retardation, two with a deletion 
of a single amino acid and one with a missense mutation in the proximal domain 
of the RSK2(RPS6KA3) (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kDa, polypeptide 3) 
protein similar to mutations found in Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS). In two 
families, the clinical diagnosis had been nonsyndromic X-linked mental 
retardation. In the third family, although CLS had been suspected, the clinical 
features were atypical and the degree of intellectual disability much less than 
expected. These families show that strict reliance on classical clinical 
criteria for mutation testing may result in a missed diagnosis. A less targeted 
screening approach to mutation testing is advocated.
