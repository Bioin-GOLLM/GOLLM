To identify new risk variants for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we 
conducted a genome-wide association study of 299,983 tagging SNPs, with 
validation in four additional series totaling 2,503 cases and 5,789 controls. We 
identified four new risk loci for CLL at 2q37.3 (rs757978, FARP2; odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.39; P = 2.11 x 10(-9)), 8q24.21 (rs2456449; OR = 1.26; P = 7.84 x 
10(-10)), 15q21.3 (rs7169431; OR = 1.36; P = 4.74 x 10(-7)) and 16q24.1 
(rs305061; OR = 1.22; P = 3.60 x 10(-7)). We also found evidence for risk loci 
at 15q25.2 (rs783540, CPEB1; OR = 1.18; P = 3.67 x 10(-6)) and 18q21.1 
(rs1036935; OR = 1.22; P = 2.28 x 10(-6)). These data provide further evidence 
for genetic susceptibility to this B-cell hematological malignancy.
