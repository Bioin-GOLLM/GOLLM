Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and 
adolescents and accounts for approximately 2% of soft tissue sarcomas in adults. 
It is subcategorized into distinct subtypes based on histological features and 
fusion status (PAX-FOXO1/VGLL2/NCOA2). Despite advances in our understanding of 
the pathobiological and molecular landscape of RMS, the prognosis of these 
tumors has not significantly improved in recent years. Developing a better 
understanding of genetic abnormalities and risk stratification beyond the fusion 
status are crucial to developing better therapeutic strategies. Herein, we aim 
to highlight the genetic pathways/abnormalities involved, specifically in 
fusion-negative RMS, assess the currently available model systems to study RMS 
pathogenesis, and discuss available prognostic factors as well as their 
importance for risk stratification to achieve optimal therapeutic management.
