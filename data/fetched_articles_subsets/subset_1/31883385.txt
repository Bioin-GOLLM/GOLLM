Noninvasive monitoring of vascularization can potentially diagnose impaired bone 
healing earlier than current radiographic methods. In this study, a noncontact 
diffuse correlation tomography (DCT) technique was employed to measure 
longitudinal blood flow changes during bone healing in a murine femoral fracture 
model. The three-dimensional distribution of the relative blood flow was 
quantified from one day pre-fracture to 48 days post-fracture. For three mice, 
frequent DCT measurements were performed every other day for one week after 
fracture, and then weekly thereafter. A decrease in blood flow was observed in 
the bone fracture region at one day post-fracture, followed by a monotonic 
increase in blood flow beyond the pre-injury baseline until five to seven days 
post-fracture. For the remaining 12 mice, only weekly DCT measurements were 
performed. Data collected on a weekly basis show the blood flow for most mice 
was elevated above baseline during the first two post-fracture weeks, followed 
by a subsequent decrease. Torsional strength of the excised femurs was measured 
for all 15 mice after 7 weeks of healing. A metric based on the early blood flow 
changes shows a statistically significant difference between the high strength 
group and the low strength group.
