A couple, both carriers of the sickle cell anaemia trait (Genotype HbAS) with an 
offspring already affected with the genetic disease underwent a Pre-implantation 
Genetic Diagnosis/Polymerase Chain Reaction screening of biopsied blastomeres. 
DNA analysis of single blastomeres was carried out to find out indicated a 
viable intra-uterine pregnancy with embryos which carried the sickle cell 
mutation, which resulted in a livebirth (HbAS). PGD/PCR in combination with IVF 
appears to be the most suitable treatment plan for patients who are at a higher 
risk of reproducing offspring affected with inheritable genetic diseases.
