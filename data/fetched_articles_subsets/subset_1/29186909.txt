Abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) gives rise to 
major pathological processes involved in the development of cardiovascular 
diseases. The use of anti-proliferative agents for VSMCs offers potential for 
the treatment of vascular disorders. Intravenous anesthetics are firmly 
established to have direct effects on VSMCs, resulting in modulation of blood 
pressure. Ketamine has been used for many years in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
for sedation, and has recently been considered for adjunctive therapy. In the 
present study, we investigated the effects of ketamine on platelet-derived 
growth factor BB (PDGF-BB)-induced VSMC proliferation and the associated 
mechanism. Ketamine concentration-dependently inhibited PDGF-BB-induced VSMC 
proliferation without cytotoxicity, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and 
extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) inhibitors, LY294002 and 
PD98059, respectively, have similar inhibitory effects. Ketamine was shown to 
attenuate PI3K, Akt, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PDGF-BB. Okadaic 
acid, a selective protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, significantly 
reversed ketamine-mediated PDGF-BB-induced PI3K, Akt, and ERK1/2 
phosphorylation; a transfected protein phosphatse 2a (pp2a) siRNA reversed Akt 
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation; and 3-O-Methyl-sphingomyeline (3-OME), an inhibitor 
of sphingomyelinase, also significantly reversed ERK1/2 phosphorylation. 
Moreover, ketamine alone significantly inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation and 
demethylation of PP2A in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the pp2a 
siRNA potently reversed the ketamine-activated catalytic subunit (PP2A-C) of 
PP2A. These results provide evidence of an anti-proliferating effect of ketamine 
in VSMCs, showing activation of PP2A blocks PI3K, Akt, and ERK phosphorylation 
that subsequently inhibits the proliferation of VSMCs. Thus, ketamine may be 
considered a potential effective therapeutic agent for reducing atherosclerotic 
process by blocking the proliferation of VSMCs.
