The alternative non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway promotes DNA 
double-strand break (DSB) repair in cells deficient for NHEJ or homologous 
recombination, suggesting that it operates at all stages of the cell cycle. 
Here, we use an approach in which DNA breaks can be induced in G1 cells and 
their repair tracked, enabling us to show that joining of DSBs is not functional 
in G1-arrested XRCC4-deficient cells. Cell cycle entry into S-G2/M restores DSB 
repair by Pol θ-dependent and PARP1-independent alternative NHEJ with repair 
products bearing kilo-base long DNA end resection, micro-homologies and 
chromosome translocations. We identify a synthetic lethal interaction between 
XRCC4 and Pol θ under conditions of G1 DSBs, associated with accumulation of 
unresolved DNA ends in S-G2/M. Collectively, our results support the conclusion 
that the repair of G1 DSBs progressing to S-G2/M by alternative NHEJ drives 
genomic instability and represent an attractive target for future DNA 
repair-based cancer therapies.
