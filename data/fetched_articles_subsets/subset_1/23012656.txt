Schwann cells respond to cues from axons by transforming their cellular 
morphology and forming myelin. We demonstrated that the guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor (GEF) cytohesin-1 promoted myelination by activating the small 
guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Arf6. In mice, ablating cytohesin-1 delayed 
myelination and diminished the amount of myelin produced. We determined that the 
Src-family kinase Fyn phosphorylated tyrosine 382 (Y(382)) of cytohesin-1, and 
we generated transgenic mice that expressed a Schwann cell-specific 
phosphorylation mutant of cytohesin-1 (Y382F) that could not be targeted by Fyn. 
During development, these transgenic mice displayed delayed myelination compared 
to that of wild-type mice, as well as a decrease in the amount of myelin 
produced, similar to that observed in cytohesin-1⁻/⁻ mice. These findings 
demonstrate that phosphorylation of cytohesin-1 by Fyn is required for full 
myelination and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of GEFs may be a mechanism 
to activate small GTPases engaged in cell morphogenesis.
