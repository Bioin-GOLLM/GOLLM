Hadal trenches are unique geological and ecological systems located along 
subduction zones. Earthquake-triggered turbidites act as efficient transport 
pathways of organic carbon (OC), yet remineralization and transformation of OC 
in these systems are not comprehensively understood. Here we measure 
concentrations and stable- and radiocarbon isotope signatures of dissolved 
organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC) in the subsurface sediment interstitial 
water along the Japan Trench axis collected during the IODP Expedition 386. We 
find accumulation and aging of DOC and DIC in the subsurface sediments, which we 
interpret as enhanced production of labile dissolved carbon owing to 
earthquake-triggered turbidites, which supports intensive microbial 
methanogenesis in the trench sediments. The residual dissolved carbon 
accumulates in deep subsurface sediments and may continue to fuel the deep 
biosphere. Tectonic events can therefore enhance carbon accumulation and 
stimulate carbon transformation in plate convergent trench systems, which may 
accelerate carbon export into the subduction zones.
