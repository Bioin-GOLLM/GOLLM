Many types of human cancers having hyperactivated Wnt signaling display no 
causative alterations in known effectors of this pathway. Here, we report a 
function of TGIF in Wnt signaling. TGIF associates with and diverts Axin1 and 
Axin2 from the β-catenin destruction complex, therefore allowing β-catenin 
accrual. Intriguingly, activation of Wnt signaling induces the expression of 
TGIF, which unveils a feed-forward loop that ensures effective integration of 
Wnt signaling. In triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), elevated levels of TGIF 
correlate with high Wnt signaling and poor survival of patients. Moreover, 
genetic experiments revealed that Tgif1 ablation impeded mammary tumor 
development in MMTV-Wnt1 mice, further underscoring a requirement of TGIF for 
oncogenic Wnt signaling.
