We report the first example of a coordinated dual action of epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) in stimulating the nuclear-cytoplasmic export and translation of a 
select messenger RNA (mRNA). The effect of EGF is mediated by the RNA-binding 
protein Grb7 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 7), which serves as an 
adaptor for a specific mRNA-protein export complex and a translational 
regulator. Using the kappa-opioid receptor (OR [KOR]) as a model, we demonstrate 
that EGF activates nuclear SHP-2 (Src homology region 2-containing tyrosine 
phosphatase), which dephosphorylates Grb7 in the nucleus. Hypophosphorylated 
Grb7 binds to the KOR mRNA and recruits the Hu antigen R-exportin-1 (CRM1) 
complex to form a nuclear-cytoplasmic export complex that exports KOR mRNA. EGF 
also activates focal adhesion kinase in the cytoplasm to rephosphorylate Grb7, 
releasing KOR mRNA for active translation. In summary, this study uncovers a 
coordinated, dual activity of EGF in facilitating nuclear export of a specific 
mRNA-protein complex as well as translational activation of the exported mRNA.
