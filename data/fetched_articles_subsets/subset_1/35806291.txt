BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death, with an 
annual global mortality rate of 18.4%. Despite advances in diagnostic and 
therapeutic technologies, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) continues to be 
characterized by a poor prognosis. This may be associated with the enrichment of 
cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the development of chemoresistance-a double-edged 
challenge that continues to impede the improvement of long-term outcomes. 
Metabolic reprogramming is a new hallmark of cancer. Sterol regulatory 
element-binding proteins (SREBPs) play crucial regulatory roles in the synthesis 
and uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, and phospholipids. Recent evidence has 
demonstrated that SREBP-1 is upregulated in several cancer types. However, its 
role in lung cancer remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the role of SREBP-1 in NSCLC biology, 
progression, and therapeutic response and explored the therapeutic 
exploitability of SREBP-1 and SREBP-1-dependent oncometabolic signaling and 
miRNA epigenetic regulation.
METHODS: We analyzed SREBP-1 levels and biological functions in clinical samples 
and the human NSCLC cell lines H441 and A549 through shRNA-based knock down of 
SREBP function, cisplatin-resistant clone generation, immunohistochemical 
staining of clinical samples, and cell viability, sphere-formation, Western 
blot, and quantitative PCR assays. We conducted in-silico analysis of miRNA 
expression in NSCLC samples by using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE102286) 
database.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that SREBP-1 and SCAP are highly expressed in NSCLC and 
are positively correlated with the aggressive phenotypes of NSCLC cells. In 
addition, downregulation of the expression of tumor-suppressing hsa-miR-497-5p, 
which predictively targets SREBP-1, was observed. We also demonstrated that 
SREBP-1/SCAP/FASN lipogenic signaling plays a key role in CSCs-like and 
chemoresistant NSCLC phenotypes, especially because the fatostatin or shRNA 
targeting of SREBP-1 significantly suppressed the viability, cisplatin 
resistance, and cancer stemness of NSCLC cells and because treatment induced the 
expression of hsa-miR-497.
CONCLUSION: Targeting the SREBP-1/hsa-miR-497 signaling axis is a potentially 
effective anticancer therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.
