All cellular functions depend on the concerted action of multiple proteins 
organized in complex networks. To understand how selection acts on protein 
networks, we used the yeast mating receptor Ste2, a pheromone-activated G 
protein-coupled receptor, as a model system. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste2 
is a hub in a network of interactions controlling both signal transduction and 
signal suppression. Through laboratory evolution, we obtained 21 mutant 
receptors sensitive to the pheromone of a related yeast species and investigated 
the molecular mechanisms behind this newfound sensitivity. While some mutants 
show enhanced binding affinity to the foreign pheromone, others only display 
weakened interactions with the network's negative regulators. Importantly, the 
latter changes have a limited impact on overall pathway regulation, despite 
their considerable effect on sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that a new 
receptor-ligand pair can evolve through network-altering mutations independently 
of receptor-ligand binding, and suggest a potential role for such mutations in 
disease.
