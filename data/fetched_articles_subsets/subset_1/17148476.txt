The carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) is a cis-acting sequence found in the 
promoters of genes induced transcriptionally by glucose. The ChoRE is composed 
of two E box-like motifs that are separated by 5 bp and is recognized by two 
basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) proteins, ChREBP and Mlx, which 
heterodimerize to bind DNA. In this study, we demonstrate that two ChREBP/Mlx 
heterodimers interact to stabilize binding to the tandem E box-like motifs in 
the ChoRE. Based on a model structure that we generated of ChREBP/Mlx bound to 
the ChoRE, we hypothesized that intermolecular interactions between residues 
within the Mlx loop regions of adjacent heterodimers are responsible for 
stabilizing the complex. We tested this hypothesis by preparing Mlx variants in 
which the loop region was replaced with that of another family member or mutated 
at several key residues. These Mlx variants retained their ability to bind to a 
single perfect E-box motif as a heterodimer with ChREBP, but no longer bound to 
the ChoRE nor supported glucose responsive activity. In summary, our results 
support a model in which the loop regions of Mlx play an important functional 
role in mediating the coordinate binding of ChREBP/Mlx heterodimers to the 
ChoRE.
