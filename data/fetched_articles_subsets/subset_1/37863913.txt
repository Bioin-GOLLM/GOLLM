Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play critical roles in 
recognizing pathogens and initiating innate immune responses. TASL, a recently 
identified innate immune adaptor protein for endolysosomal TLR7/8/9 signaling, 
is recruited by the lysosomal proton-coupled amino-acid transporter SLC15A4, and 
then activates IRF5, which in turn triggers the transcription of type I 
interferons and cytokines. Here, we report three cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM) structures of human SLC15A4 in the apo monomeric and dimeric state and 
as a TASL-bound complex. The apo forms are in an outward-facing conformation, 
with the dimeric form showing an extensive interface involving four cholesterol 
molecules. The structure of the TASL-bound complex reveals an unprecedented 
interaction mode with solute carriers. During the recruitment of TASL, SLC15A4 
undergoes a conformational change from an outward-facing, lysosomal 
lumen-exposed state to an inward-facing state to form a binding pocket, allowing 
the N-terminal helix of TASL to be inserted into. Our findings provide insights 
into the molecular basis of regulatory switch involving a human solute carrier 
and offers an important framework for structure-guided drug discovery targeting 
SLC15A4-TASL-related human autoimmune diseases.
