This study summarizes 47 novel mutations identified during routine molecular 
diagnostics for Alport syndrome. We detected 34 in COL4A5, the gene responsible 
for X-linked Alport syndrome, and 13 in COL4A3 and COL4A4, the genes responsible 
for autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. A high detection rate of 90% was 
achieved among patients with typical clinical symptoms and a characteristic 
family history in both X-linked and autosomal recessive forms, and it can be 
assumed that most relevant mutations have been identified. In numerous 
positively tested patients, genetic variations which are unknown were detected.
