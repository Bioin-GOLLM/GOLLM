Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in 
the CP gene, encoding the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin. A mutation in 
the CP gene results in brain and systemic iron overload, which is classified as 
a rare subtype of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Here, 
we used the Sendai virus delivery system to generate induced pluripotent stem 
cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a patient carrying the CP 
c.607+1 delG homozygous splicing mutation. The generated cell line retained the 
original genotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and differentiated into cells 
of the three germ layers.
