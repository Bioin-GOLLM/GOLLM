INTRODUCTION: Cronkhite Canada Syndrome (CCS) is a rare syndrome, described in 
1955 by Americans, Leonard Wolsey Cronkhite and Wilma Jeanne Canada in the New 
England Journal of Medicine [1]. About 450 cases have been reported. 
Complications, like malignant transformation, unprovoked thromboembolism is 
known. Since there is wide variability in medical presentation, no definitive 
diagnostic and treatment protocol s have been set. The mortality remains at 55%.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 50 year old male patient presenting 
with diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, ectodermal features. His upper (UGI) 
and lower Gastrointestinal (LGI) endoscopy showed multiple polypoidal and carpet 
like lesions in fundus, body and antrum of stomach. Videocolonoscopy showed 
multiple sessile and pedunculated polyps. Multiple biopsies were taken, proving 
malignancy. Because of poor nutrition, total parenteral nutrition was given for 
four weeks. After nutritional optimization, he underwent laparoscopic assisted 
subtotal colectomy. His post-operative course was complicated by the occurrence 
of pulmonary embolism and anastomotic leak.
DISCUSSION: CCS is an ailment of unknown pathophysiology. Considering what is 
known so far, patients suffering from CCS are at highest risk of thromboembolic 
episodes. This seems to be irrespective of surgical intervention. Patients of 
CCS should have thromboembolic prophylaxis started as soon as a diagnosis is 
made. They should have thrombophilia profile, fibrinogen level and Factor 8 
tested before any intervention is planned.
CONCLUSION: If CCS presents with a surgical indication, namely malignancy, the 
patient should be categorized as highest risk for thromboembolic complications 
and both mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis be instituted.
