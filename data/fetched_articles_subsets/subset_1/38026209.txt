Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neurons have shown promise in 
treating spinal cord injury (SCI). We previously showed that hPSC-derived dorsal 
spinal γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons can alleviate spasticity and promote 
locomotion in rats with SCI, but their long-term safety remains elusive. Here, 
we characterized the long-term fate and safety of human dorsal spinal GABA 
neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in naive rats over one year. All grafted NPCs had 
undergone differentiation, yielding mainly neurons and astrocytes. Fully mature 
human neurons grew many axons and formed numerous synapses with rat neural 
circuits, together with mature human astrocytes that structurally integrated 
into the rat spinal cord. The sensorimotor function of rats was not impaired by 
intraspinal transplantation, even when human neurons were activated or inhibited 
by designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). These 
findings represent a significant step toward the clinical translation of human 
spinal neuron transplantation for treating SCI.
