Judicious modifications to the structure of the previously reported HCV NS5A 
inhibitor 1, resulted in more potent anti-HCV compounds with similar and in some 
cases improved toxicity profiles. The synthesis of 19 new NS5A inhibitors is 
reported along with their ability to block HCV replication in an HCV 1b replicon 
system. For the most potent compounds chemical stability, stability in liver 
microsomes and inhibition of relevant CYP450 enzymes is also presented.
