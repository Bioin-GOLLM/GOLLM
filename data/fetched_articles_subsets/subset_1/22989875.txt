Kindlin-3, a 75-kDa protein, has been shown to be critical for hemostasis, 
immunity, and bone metabolism via its role in integrin activation. The Kindlin 
family is hallmarked by a FERM domain comprised of F1, F2, and F3 subdomains 
together with an N-terminal F0 domain and a pleckstrin homology domain inserted 
in the F2 domain. Recombinant Kindlin-3 was cloned, expressed, and purified, and 
its domain organization was studied by x-ray scattering and other techniques to 
reveal an extended conformation. This unusual elongated structure is similar to 
that found in the paralogue Talin head domain. Analytical ultracentrifugation 
experiments indicated that Kindlin-3 forms a ternary complex with the Talin and 
β-integrin cytoplasmic tails. NMR showed that Kindlin-3 specifically recognizes 
the membrane-distal tail NPXY motif in both the β(1A) and β(1D) isoforms, 
although the interaction is stronger with β(1A). An upstream Ser/Thr cluster in 
the tails also plays a critical role. Overall these data support current 
biological, clinical, and mutational data on Kindlin-3/β-tail binding and 
provide novel insights into the overall conformation and interactions of 
Kindlin-3.
