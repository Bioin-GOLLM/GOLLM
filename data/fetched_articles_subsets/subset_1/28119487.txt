BACKGROUND: Cohesinopathies are rare neurodevelopmental disorders arising from a 
dysfunction in the cohesin pathway, which enables chromosome segregation and 
regulates gene transcription. So far, eight genes from this pathway have been 
reported in human disease. STAG1 belongs to the STAG subunit of the core cohesin 
complex, along with five other subunits. This work aimed to identify the 
phenotype ascribed to STAG1 mutations.
METHODS: Among patients referred for intellectual disability (ID) in genetics 
departments worldwide, array-comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), gene 
panel, whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing were performed 
following the local diagnostic standards.
RESULTS: A mutation in STAG1 was identified in 17 individuals from 16 families, 
9 males and 8 females aged 2-33 years. Four individuals harboured a small 
microdeletion encompassing STAG1; three individuals from two families had an 
intragenic STAG1 deletion. Six deletions were identified by array-CGH, one by 
whole-exome sequencing. Whole-exome sequencing found de novo heterozygous 
missense or frameshift STAG1 variants in eight patients, a panel of genes 
involved in ID identified a missense and a frameshift variant in two 
individuals. The 17 patients shared common facial features, with wide mouth and 
deep-set eyes. Four individuals had mild microcephaly, seven had epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: We report an international series of 17 individuals from 16 
families presenting with syndromic unspecific ID that could be attributed to a 
STAG1 deletion or point mutation. This first series reporting the phenotype 
ascribed to mutation in STAG1 highlights the importance of data sharing in the 
field of rare disorders.
