The V363I mutation of the microtubule-associated protein tau gene has previously 
been associated with a case of primary progressive nonfluent aphasia with 
variable penetrance. Herein, we report the finding of the V363I variation in a 
sporadic early onset frontotemporal dementia patient and in several members of 
her family. The V363I variation was associated with frontotemporal dementia only 
in the proband which was also homozygous for the A allele of the progranulin 
single-nucleotide polymorphism rs9897526 and for methionine at codon 129 of the 
prion protein gene. The microtubule-associated protein tau V363I variation could 
be considered either an incomplete penetrant mutation or a rare polymorphism; 
although its pathogenicity has yet to be clearly demonstrated, modifier genetic 
factors seem to contribute to the pathogenic effects observed in the patient 
underlining the great complexity existing in neurodegenerative diseases and 
questioning so-called sporadic cases that can potentially be caused by gene 
mutation.
