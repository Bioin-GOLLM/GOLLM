We have utilized the persistent elevation of fractional excretion (FE) of urate, 
> 10%, to differentiate cerebral/renal salt wasting (RSW) from the syndrome of 
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), in which a normalization 
of FEurate occurs after correction of hyponatremia.  Previous studies suggest as 
well  that an elevated FEurate with normonatremia, without pre-existing 
hyponatremia, is also consistent with RSW, including studies demonstrating 
induction of RSW in rats infused with plasma from normonatremic neurosurgical 
and Alzheimer's disease patients.  The present studies were designed to test 
whether precipitates from the urine of normonatremic neurosurgical patients, 
with either normal or elevated FEurate, and patients with SIADH, display 
natriuretic activity.  
METHODS: Ammonium sulfate precipitates from the urine of 6 RSW and 5 non-RSW 
Control patients were dialyzed (10 kDa cutoff) to remove the ammonium sulfate, 
lyophilized, and the reconstituted precipitate was tested for its effect on 
transcellular transport of (22)Na across LLC-PK1 cells grown to confluency in 
transwells.
RESULTS: Precipitates from 5 of the 6 patients with elevated FEurate and 
normonatremia significantly inhibited the in vitro transcellular transport of 
(22)Na above a concentration of 3 μg protein/ml, by 10-25%, versus to vehicle 
alone, and by 15-40% at concentrations of 5-20 μg/ml as compared to precipitates 
from 4 of the 5 non-RSW patients with either normal FEurate and normonatremia (2 
patients) or with SIADH (2 patients).
CONCLUSION: These studies provide further evidence that an elevated FEurate with 
normonatremia is highly consistent with RSW.  Evidence in the urine of 
natriuretic activity suggests significant renal excretion of the natriuretic 
factor. The potentially large source of the natriuretic factor that this could 
afford, coupled with small analytical sample sizes required by the in-vitro 
bioassay used here, should facilitate future experimental analysis and allow the 
natriuretic factor to be investigated as a potential biomarker for RSW.
