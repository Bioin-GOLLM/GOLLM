Cortical bone thickness is important for the mechanical function of bone. 
Ontogeny, aging, sex, body size, hormone levels, diet, behavior, and genetics 
potentially cause variations in postcranial cortical robusticity. However, the 
factors associated with cranial cortical robusticity remain poorly understood. 
Few studies have examined cortical robusticity in both cranial and postcranial 
bones jointly. In the present study, we used computed tomography (CT) images to 
measure cortical bone thicknesses in the cranial vault and humeral diaphysis. 
This study clearly showed that females have a greater cranial vault thickness 
and greater age-related increase in cranial vault thickness than males. We found 
an age-related increase in the full thickness of the temporal cranial vault and 
the width of the humeral diaphysis, as well as an age-related decrease in the 
cortical thickness of the frontal cranial vault and the cortical thickness of 
the humeral diaphysis, suggesting that the mechanisms of bone modeling in 
cranial and long bones are similar. A positive correlation between cortical 
indices in the cranial vault and humeral diaphysis also suggested that common 
factors affect cortical robusticity. We also examined the association of 
polymorphisms in the WNT16 and TNFSF11 genes with bone thickness. However, no 
significant associations were observed. The present study provides fundamental 
knowledge about similarities and differences in the mechanisms of bone modeling 
between cranial and postcranial bones.
