Hydroxyurea (HU), the first of two drugs approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration for treating patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), produces 
anti-sickling effect by re-activating fetal γ-globin gene to enhance production 
of fetal hemoglobin. However, approximately 30% of the patients do not respond 
to HU therapy. The molecular basis of non-responsiveness to HU is not clearly 
understood. To address this question, we examined HU-induced changes in the RNA 
and protein levels of transcription factors NF-Y, GATA-1, -2, BCL11A, TR4, MYB 
and NF-E4 that assemble the γ-globin promoter complex and regulate transcription 
of γ-globin gene. In erythroblasts cultured from peripheral blood CD34+ cells of 
patients with SCD, we found that HU-induced changes in the protein but not the 
RNA levels of activator GATA-2 and repressors GATA-1, BCL11A and TR4 correlated 
with HU-induced changes in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in the peripheral blood 
of HU high and low responders. However, HU did not significantly induce changes 
in the protein or RNA levels of activators NF-Y and NF-E4. Based on HU-induced 
changes in the protein levels of GATA-2, -1 and BCL11A, we calculated an Index 
of Hydroxyurea Responsiveness (IndexHU-3). Compared to the HU-induced fold 
changes in the individual transcription factor protein levels, the numerical 
values of IndexHU-3 statistically correlated best with the HU-induced peripheral 
blood HbF levels of the patients. Thus, IndexHU-3 can serve as an appropriate 
indicator for inherent HU responsiveness of patients with SCD.
