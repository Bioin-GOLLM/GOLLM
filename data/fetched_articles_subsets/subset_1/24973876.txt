The association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene 
polymorphisms and breast cancer risk has been extensively explored, but their 
results are conflicting rather than conclusive. To derive a more precise 
estimation, we carried out not only an updated meta-analysis but also a combined 
analysis based on all the available studies estimating the association between 
MTHFR C677T and/or A1298C and breast cancer risk. With respect to C677T 
polymorphism, the results suggested that 677T allele was associated with 
significantly elevated breast cancer risk in overall analysis (T vs. C: OR 
1.073, 95 % CI 1.028-1.120; TT vs. CC: OR 1.177, 95 % CI 1.072-1.293; TT vs. CC 
+ CT: OR 1.175, 95 % CI 1.073-1.288); Stratifying by ethnicity, significantly 
increased risk was only found in East Asians (T vs. C: OR 1.150, 95 % CI 
1.039-1.273; TT vs. CC: OR 1.441, 95 % CI 1.145-1.814; TT vs. CC + CT: OR 1.413, 
95 % CI 1.148-1.739); When stratified by menopausal status, statistically 
significant association was found for postmenopausal women (CT + TT vs. CC: OR 
1.092, 95 % CI 1.011-1.179). In regard to A1298C polymorphism, no significant 
associations were found between the polymorphism and breast cancer risk. With 
respect to MTHFR haplotypes, significantly elevated breast cancer risk was 
associated with 677T-1298C for overall result (OR 1.498, 95 % CI 1.143-1.962) 
and for Caucasians (OR 2.088, 95 % CI 1.277-3.416) when compared with 
677C-1298A; Haplotype 677C-1298C might provide higher protection than 677C-1298A 
in East Asians (OR 0.840, 95 % CI 0.742-0.949). The combined genotypes for C677T 
and A1298C produced a significant OR for the 677TT/1298AC relative to 
677CC/1298AA in overall population (OR 2.047, 95 % CI 1.275-3.288); When 
stratified by ethnicity, significant ORs were only found for East Asians 
(677CC/1298CC vs. 677CC/1298AA: OR 0.686, 95 % CI 0.478-0.985; 677TT/1298AC vs. 
677CC/1298AA: OR 2.181, 95 % CI 1.179-4.035). The findings suggest that the 
MTHFR C677T polymorphism but not A1298C, and some variants on their combined 
genotypes or haplotypes may be involved with the development of breast cancer.
