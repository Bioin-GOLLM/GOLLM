The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic forced urgent measures for the development of 
new therapeutics. One of these strategies is the use of convalescent plasma (CP) 
as a conventional source for passive immunity. Recently, there has been interest 
in CP-derived exosomes. In this report, we present a structural, biochemical, 
and biological characterization of our proprietary product, convalescent human 
immune plasma-derived exosome (ChipEXO), following the guidelines set forth by 
the Turkish Ministry of Health and the Turkish Red Crescent, the Good 
Manufacturing Practice, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles, 
and the Gene Ontology Consortium. The data support the safety and efficacy of 
this product against SARS-CoV-2 infections in preclinical models.
