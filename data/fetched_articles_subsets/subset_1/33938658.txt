Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a rare disease defined as heavy 
proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema presenting in the first 
three months of life. It is most commonly caused by mutations in the NPHS1 gene 
associated with nephrotic syndrome type 1, also known as Finnish-type CNS, which 
is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Symptomatic treatment with 
intravenous albumins, vitamins, minerals, nutritional, and hormonal 
supplementation and treatment of complications are mandatory. Children 
refractory to the symptomatic treatment are recommended to undergo nephrectomy 
and renal replacement therapy, preferably renal transplantation. We report on a 
child with Finnish type CNS with a NPHS1 mutation, which is the first case 
confirmed by genetic study in Slovenia. We showed for the first time that 
homozygous mutation c.2928-3del in the NPHS1 gene caused exon 22 skipping, 
leading to a truncated protein and Fin-minor phenotype.
