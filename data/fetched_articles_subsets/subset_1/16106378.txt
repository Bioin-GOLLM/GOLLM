Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) has a histidine at position 64 (His64) that 
donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide in catalysis of the dehydration of 
bicarbonate. To examine the effect of the histidine location on proton 
shuttling, His64 was replaced with Ala and Thr200 replaced with histidine 
(H64A-T200H HCAII), effectively relocating the proton shuttle residue 2 A closer 
to the zinc-bound hydroxide compared to wild type HCA II. The crystal structure 
of H64A-T200H HCA II at 1.8 A resolution shows the side chain of His200 directly 
hydrogen-bonded with the zinc-bound solvent. Different proton transfer processes 
were observed at pH 6 and at pH 8 during the catalytic hydration-dehydration 
cycle, measured by mass spectrometry as the depletion of 18O from C18O2 by 
H64A-T200H HCA II. The process at pH 6.0 is attributed to proton transfer 
between the side chain of His200 and the zinc-bound hydroxide, in analogy with 
proton transfer involving His64 in wild-type HCA II. At pH 8.0 it is attributed 
to proton transfer between bicarbonate and the zinc-bound hydroxide, as 
supported by the dependence of the rate of proton transfer on bicarbonate 
concentration and on solvent hydrogen isotope effects. This study establishes 
that a histidine directly hydrogen-bonded to the zinc-bound hydroxide, can adopt 
the correct distance geometry to support proton transfer
