BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested an association between vascular 
endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) rs3025039 polymorphism and biliary atresia 
(BA). However, this conclusion is controversial and there is no published pooled 
evidence of this association.
METHODS: This study was conducted and reported according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The protocol was 
registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic 
Reviews). A thorough search was performed on databases including PubMed, Embase, 
and Chinese Biomedical Database up to August 2020. This study included 846 cases 
of BA and 2821 controls concerning VEGFA rs3025039 polymorphism. We selected 
relevant studies based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) the study design 
was case-control and cohort and (2) the patients carried standard clinical 
diagnoses of BA, etc. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with 
other related diseases, (2) lack of requisite information and (3) duplicate 
data. The OR (odd ratio) and the corresponding 95% CI (confidence interval) were 
calculated to estimate the association.
RESULTS: This study on VEGFA rs3025039 polymorphism in the Chinese population 
included 846 cases and 2821 controls. The results showed that there was no 
significant association between rs3025039 and susceptibility to BA under four 
genetic models. The results of the subgroup analysis were similar to the overall 
results.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that rs3025039 was not associated with 
susceptibility to BA in the Chinese population. Further validation may entail 
additional research.
