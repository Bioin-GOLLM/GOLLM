BACKGROUND/AIM: The study aimed to evaluate associations of relative leukocyte 
telomere length (LTL) and polymorphisms of telomere length-associated genes TERT 
(rs2736098), TERT-CLPTM1L (rs401681), TRF1 (rs1545827, rs10107605) and TNKS2 
(rs10509637, rs10509639) in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma 
(LSCC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 300 patients with LSCC and 369 
healthy control subjects. Genotyping and relative LTL measuring were carried out 
using qPCR.
RESULTS: Relative LTL was statistically significantly shorter in the G3 (tumor 
differentiation grade) subgroup of patients with LSCC compared to the G1 and G2 
subgroups. Significant differences were found in genotype distributions of TERT 
rs401681 and TNKS2 rs10509639 between the study groups. TERT rs401681 C/T and 
T/T genotypes were associated with approximately 30% decreased odds of LSCC 
development.
CONCLUSION: LTL was shorter in the G3 subgroup compared to the G2 and G1 
subgroups of LSCC patients. TERT rs401681 and its C/T and T/T genotypes were 
associated with decreased odds of overall LSCC development.
