The purpose of the investigation was to study some indices of the immune system 
of patients with diffuse toxic goiter (DTG) before multimodality thyrostatic 
therapy and after achieving clinical remission. A total of 30 DTG patients with 
an average severity of disease were examined. The immune status was evaluated 
according to the content of T-lymphocytes, T-suppressors, Fc gamma-lymphocytes 
and antigen-binding lymphocytes (ABL) responsive to thyroglobulin. Conservative 
therapy included mercazolyl, beta-adrenergic blockers, sedative and cardiac 
drugs. A drop of T1T gamma and Fc gamma-lymphocytes was revealed in the period 
of the manifestation of the clinical signs of disease. The indices of ABL 
responsive to thyroglobulin significantly exceeded the relative and absolute 
indices of the control group. Multimodality drug therapy resulted in the 
deepening of T-lymphocyte deficiency, a significant rise of T gamma 1 and T 
gamma 2 as compared to the initial levels. A tendency to a decrease in the level 
of Fc gamma-lumphocytes was noted after the therapy. The relative and absolute 
values of the ABL indices significantly decreased, however a significant 
increase in these indices compared to the control ones maintained.
