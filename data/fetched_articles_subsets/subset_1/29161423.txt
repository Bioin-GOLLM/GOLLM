We introduce a new protocol, mutational sequencing or muSeq, which uses sodium 
bisulfite to randomly deaminate unmethylated cytosines at a fixed and tunable 
rate. The muSeq protocol marks each initial template molecule with a unique 
mutation signature that is present in every copy of the template, and in every 
fragmented copy of a copy. In the sequenced read data, this signature is 
observed as a unique pattern of C-to-T or G-to-A nucleotide conversions. 
Clustering reads with the same conversion pattern enables accurate count and 
long-range assembly of initial template molecules from short-read sequence data. 
We explore count and low-error sequencing by profiling 135 000 restriction 
fragments in a PstI representation, demonstrating that muSeq improves copy 
number inference and significantly reduces sporadic sequencer error. We explore 
long-range assembly in the context of cDNA, generating contiguous transcript 
clusters greater than 3,000 bp in length. The muSeq assemblies reveal 
transcriptional diversity not observable from short-read data alone.
