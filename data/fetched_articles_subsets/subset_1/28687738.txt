Humans and dogs are the two major hosts of Strongyloides stercoralis, an 
intestinal parasitic nematode. To better understand the phylogenetic 
relationships among S. stercoralis isolates infecting humans and dogs and to 
assess the zoonotic potential of this parasite, we analyzed mitochondrial Cox1, 
nuclear 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, and a major sperm protein domain-containing protein 
genes. Overall, our analyses indicated the presence of two distinct lineages of 
S. stercoralis (referred to as type A and type B). While type A parasites were 
isolated both from humans and dogs in different countries, type B parasites were 
found exclusively in dogs, indicating that the type B has not adapted to infect 
humans. These epidemiological data, together with the close phylogenetic 
relationship of S. stercoralis with S. procyonis, a Strongyloides parasite of 
raccoons, possibly indicates that S. stercoralis originally evolved as a canid 
parasite, and later spread into humans. The inability to infect humans might be 
an ancestral character of this species and the type B might be surmised to be an 
origin population from which human-infecting strains are derived.
