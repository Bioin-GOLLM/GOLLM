BACKGROUND: The relevance of HBV genotype diversity on interferon (IFN) therapy 
outcome in chronic hepatitis B patients has recently been highlighted. Data 
available for genotype F is poor. The aim of this work was to analyse the 
response of HBV genotype F to treatment with IFN. Additionally, response was 
analysed according to the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near to 
the IL28B gene.
METHODS: A total of 29 HBeAg-positive patients with chronic infection were 
included with a median age 47 (18-68) years. Of them, 27 were male. One patient 
was treated with standard IFN-α for 16 weeks, 6 patients received PEG-IFN-α2a 
180 μg weekly for 24 weeks and 22 patients for 48 weeks. Response to treatment 
was defined as loss of HBeAg, anti-HBe seroconversion and decline of HBV DNA 
level to below 3 log of baseline (IU/ml) at the 6-month of follow-up. The SNPs 
rs12979860, rs12980275 and rs8099917 were studied by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: The overall response was obtained in 18 (62%) patients, including one 
patient who was treated with standard IFN. Additionally, a total of 9 (31%) 
patients cleared HBsAg, with appearance of anti-HBs. The viral load was 
undetectable in all of these patients. The same IL28B variants associated with 
IFN response in HCV infections were also more frequently found in HBV patients 
compared with non-responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that treatment with IFN is effective in 
patients with HBV genotype F.
