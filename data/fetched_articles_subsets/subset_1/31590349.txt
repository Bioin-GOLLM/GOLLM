A large number of nutrients and bioactive ingredients found in milk play an 
important role in the nourishment of breast-fed infants and dairy consumers. 
Some of these ingredients include physiologically relevant compounds such as 
vitamins, peptides, neuroactive compounds and hormones. Conversely, milk may 
contain substances-drugs, pesticides, carcinogens, environmental 
pollutants-which have undesirable effects on health. The transfer of these 
compounds into milk is unavoidably linked to the function of transport proteins. 
Expression of transporters belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) and 
Solute Carrier (SLC-) superfamilies varies with the lactation stages of the 
mammary gland. In particular, Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides 1A2 
(OATP1A2) and 2B1 (OATP2B1), Organic Cation Transporter 1 (OCT1), Novel Organic 
Cation Transporter 1 (OCTN1), Concentrative Nucleoside Transporters 1, 2 and 3 
(CNT1, CNT2 and CNT3), Peptide Transporter 2 (PEPT2), Sodium-dependent Vitamin C 
Transporter 2 (SVCT2), Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 5 (ABCC5) and 
Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2) are highly induced during lactation. 
This review will focus on these transporters overexpressed during lactation and 
their role in the transfer of products into the milk, including both beneficial 
and harmful compounds. Furthermore, additional factors, such as regulation, 
polymorphisms or drug-drug interactions will be described.
