Entirely intrinsic third ventricular craniopharyngiomas showed characteristics 
of a round/oval shaped tumor, with rare calcification and cyst formation, and 
pathologically squamous-papillary type with a positive BRAFV600E mutation. We 
report an extremely rare case of entirely intrinsic third ventricular 
craniopharyngioma, pathologically adamantiomatous but with BRAFV600E mutation 
genetically, developed in a 35-year-old female. It was oval-shaped, with no 
calcification or cyst, and showed homogeneous enhancement. As shown in this 
case, it was difficult to differentiate this pathology from chordoid glioma of 
third ventricle, and the difficulty of this differential diagnosis has not been 
well documented in previous studies. Our case further implied the importance of 
molecular diagnosis for subclassification of craniopharyngioma. The 
BRAFV600E-mutated craniopharyngioma could be the target for the development of 
treatment with preoperative BRAF-inhibitors. Therefore, differentiation between 
entirely intrinsic third ventricular craniopharyngiomas and chordoid glioma 
could be new issue. In this report, we discuss about the preoperative 
differential diagnosis from chordoid glioma and the literature review. (Received
