BACKGROUND AND AIMS: At present, there is a lack of simple and reliable model 
for early prediction of the efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA). This study aimed to generate and validate prediction 
models of etanercept efficacy in patients with JIA before administration using 
machine learning algorithms based on electronic medical record (EMR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: EMR data of 87 JIA patients treated with etanercept 
between January 2011 and December 2018 were collected retrospectively. The 
response of etanercept was evaluated by using DAS44/ESR-3 simplified standard. 
The stepwise forward and backward method based on information gain was applied 
to select features. Five machine learning algorithms, including Extreme Gradient 
Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), 
Extremely Random Trees (ET) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used for model 
generation and validation with fifty-fold stratified cross-validation. EMR data 
of additional 14 patients were collected for external validation of the model.
RESULTS: Tender joint count (TJC), Time interval, Lymphocyte percentage (LYM), 
and Weight were screened out and included in the final model. The model 
generated by the XGBoost algorithm based on the above 4 features had the best 
predictive performance: sensitivity 75%, specificity 66.67%, accuracy 72.22%, 
AUC 79.17%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: A pre-administration model with good prediction performance for 
etanercept response in JIA was developed using advanced machine learning 
algorithms. Clinicians and pharmacists can use this simple and accurate model to 
predict etanercept response of JIA early and avoid treatment failure or adverse 
effects.
