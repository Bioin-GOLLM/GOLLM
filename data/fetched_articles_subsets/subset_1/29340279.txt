BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Chinese population typically has inadequate 
folate intake and no mandatory folic acid fortification. 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase 
(MTRR) are the two key regulatory enzymes in the folate/homocysteine (Hcy) 
metabolism. Hcy has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular 
disease. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess whether the MTHFR gene A1298C 
and the MTRR gene A66G polymorphisms affect Hcy levels in the Chinese 
population.
METHODS: This analysis included 13 studies with Hcy levels reported as one of 
the study measurements. Summary estimates of weighted mean differences and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using random-effect models.
RESULTS: Overall, there were no significant differences in Hcy concentrations 
between participants with the MTHFR 1298 CC (12 trials, n = 129), AA (n = 2166; 
β, -0.51 μmol/L; 95%CI: -2.14, 1.11; P = 0.53), or AC genotype (n = 958; β, 0.55 
μmol/L; 95%CI: -0.72, 1.82; P = 0.40). Consistently, compared to those with the 
MTRR 66 GG genotype (6 trials, n = 156), similar Hcy concentrations were found 
in participants with the AA (n = 832; β, -0.43 μmol/L; 95%CI: -1.04, 0.17; P = 
0.16) or AG (n =743; β, -0.57 μmol/L; 95%CI: -1.46, 0.31; P = 0.21) genotype. 
Similar results were observed for the dominant and recessive models.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism nor the MTRR A66G 
polymorphism affects Hcy levels in the Chinese population.
