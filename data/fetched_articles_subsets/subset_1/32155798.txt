Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen of humans, causing 
both the sexually transmitted infection, chlamydia, and the most common cause of 
infectious blindness, trachoma. The majority of sequenced C. trachomatis 
clinical isolates carry a 7.5-Kb plasmid, and it is becoming increasingly 
evident that this is a key determinant of pathogenicity. The discovery of the 
Swedish New Variant and the more recent Finnish variant highlight the importance 
of understanding the natural extent of variation in the plasmid. In this study 
we analysed 524 plasmid sequences from publicly available whole-genome sequence 
data. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in each of the eight coding 
sequences (CDS) were identified and analysed. There were 224 base positions out 
of a total 7550 bp that carried a SNP, which equates to a SNP rate of 2.97%, 
nearly three times what was previously calculated. After normalising for CDS 
size, CDS8 had the highest SNP rate at 3.97% (i.e., number of SNPs per total 
number of nucleotides), whilst CDS6 had the lowest at 1.94%. CDS5 had the 
highest total number of SNPs across the 524 sequences analysed (2267 SNPs), 
whereas CDS6 had the least SNPs with only 85 SNPs. Calculation of the genetic 
distances identified CDS6 as the least variable gene at the nucleotide level (d 
= 0.001), and CDS5 as the most variable (d = 0.007); however, at the amino acid 
level CDS2 was the least variable (d = 0.001), whilst CDS5 remained the most 
variable (d = 0.013). This study describes the largest in-depth analysis of the 
C. trachomatis plasmid to date, through the analysis of plasmid sequence data 
mined from whole genome sequences spanning 50 years and from a worldwide 
distribution, providing insights into the nature and extent of existing 
variation within the plasmid as well as guidance for the design of future 
diagnostic assays. This is crucial at a time when single-target diagnostic 
assays are failing to detect natural mutants, putting those infected at risk of 
a serious long-term and life-changing illness.
