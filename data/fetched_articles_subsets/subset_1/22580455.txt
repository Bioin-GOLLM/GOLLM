Extracellular mitogen signal transduction is initiated by ligand binding to 
specific receptors of target cells. This causes a cellular response that 
frequently triggers the activation of tyrosine kinases. Non-receptor kinases 
like Src and Lyn can directly phosphorylate the Cdk inhibitor protein p27 (Kip1) 
. Tyrosine phosphorylation can cause impaired Cdk-inhibitory activity and 
decreased stability of p27. In addition to these non-receptor tyrosine kinases, 
the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was recently 
identified to phosphorylate p27. JAK2 becomes activated through binding of 
various cytokines and growth factors to their corresponding receptors and can 
directly bind and selectively phosphorylate tyrosine residue 88 (Y88) of the Cdk 
inhibitor p27. This impairs Cdk inhibition by p27 and promotes its 
ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Via this mechanism, JAK2 can link 
cytokine and growth factor initiated signal transduction to p27 regulation, 
whereas oncogenes like JAK2V617F or BCR-Abl can use this mechanism to inactivate 
the Cdk inhibitor.
