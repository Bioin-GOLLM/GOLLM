The pathogenic Yersinia species share a conserved type III secretion system, 
which delivers cytotoxic effectors known as Yops into target mammalian cells. In 
all three species, YopK (also called YopQ) plays an important role in regulating 
this process. In cell culture infections, yopK mutants inject higher levels of 
Yops, leading to increase cytotoxicity; however, in vivo the same mutants are 
highly attenuated. In this work, we investigate the mechanism behind this 
paradox. Using a β-lactamase reporter assay to directly measure the effect of 
YopK on translocation, we demonstrated that YopK controls the rate of Yop 
injection. Furthermore, we find that YopK cannot regulate effector Yop 
translocation from within the bacterial cytosol. YopE is also injected into host 
cells and was previously shown to contribute to regulation of the injectisome. 
In this work we show that YopK and YopE work at different steps to regulate Yop 
injection, with YopK functioning independently of YopE. Finally, by expressing 
YopK within tissue culture cells, we confirm that YopK regulates translocation 
from inside the host cell, and we show that cells pre-loaded with YopK are 
resistant to Yop injection. These results suggest a novel role for YopK in 
controlling the Yersinia type III secretion system.
