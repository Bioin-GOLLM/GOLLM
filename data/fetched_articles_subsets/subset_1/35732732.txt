Bacterial conjugation is the fundamental process of unidirectional transfer of 
DNAs, often plasmid DNAs, from a donor cell to a recipient cell1. It is the 
primary means by which antibiotic resistance genes spread among bacterial 
populations2,3. In Gram-negative bacteria, conjugation is mediated by a large 
transport apparatus-the conjugative type IV secretion system (T4SS)-produced by 
the donor cell and embedded in both its outer and inner membranes. The T4SS also 
elaborates a long extracellular filament-the conjugative pilus-that is essential 
for DNA transfer4,5. Here we present a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM) structure of a 2.8 megadalton T4SS complex composed of 92 polypeptides 
representing 8 of the 10 essential T4SS components involved in pilus biogenesis. 
We added the two remaining components to the structural model using co-evolution 
analysis of protein interfaces, to enable the reconstitution of the entire 
system including the pilus. This structure describes the exceptionally large 
protein-protein interaction network required to assemble the many components 
that constitute a T4SS and provides insights on the unique mechanism by which 
they elaborate pili.
