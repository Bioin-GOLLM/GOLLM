Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are now 
known as parts of a disease spectrum with common pathological features and 
genetic causes. However, as both conditions are clinically heterogeneous, 
patient groups may be phenotypically similar but pathogenically and genetically 
variable. Despite numerous clinical trials, there remains no effective therapy 
for these conditions, which, in part, may be due to challenges of therapy 
development in a heterogeneous patient population. Disruption to protein 
homeostasis is a key feature of different forms of ALS and FTD. Targeting the 
endogenous protein chaperone system, the heat shock response (HSR) may, 
therefore, be a potential therapeutic approach. We conducted a preclinical study 
of a known pharmacological amplifier of the HSR, called arimoclomol, in mice 
with a mutation in valosin-containing protein (VCP) which causes both ALS and 
FTD in patients. We demonstrate that amplification of the HSR ameliorates the 
ALS/FTD-like phenotype in the spinal cord and brain of mutant VCP mice and 
prevents neuronal loss, replicating our earlier findings in the SOD1 mouse model 
of ALS. Moreover, in human cell models, we demonstrate improvements in pathology 
upon arimoclomol treatment in mutant VCP patient fibroblasts and iPSC-derived 
motor neurons. Our findings suggest that targeting of the HSR may have 
therapeutic potential, not only in non-SOD1 ALS, but also for the treatment of 
FTD.
