The pathogenesis of infectious diarrheal diseases is largely attributed to 
enterotoxins that cause dehydration by disrupting intestinal water absorption. 
We investigated patterns of genetic variation in mammalian guanylate cyclase-C 
(GC-C), an intestinal receptor targeted by bacterially encoded heat-stable 
enterotoxins (STa), to determine how host species adapt in response to diarrheal 
infections. Our phylogenetic and functional analysis of GC-C supports 
long-standing evolutionary conflict with diarrheal bacteria in primates and 
bats, with highly variable susceptibility to STa across species. In bats, we 
further show that GC-C diversification has sparked compensatory mutations in the 
endogenous uroguanylin ligand, suggesting an unusual scenario of pathogen-driven 
evolution of an entire signaling axis. Together, these findings suggest that 
conflicts with diarrheal pathogens have had far-reaching impacts on the 
evolution of mammalian gut physiology.
