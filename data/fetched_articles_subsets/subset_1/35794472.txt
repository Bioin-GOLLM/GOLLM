Individuals can exhibit differences in metabolism that are caused by the 
interplay of genetic background, nutritional input, microbiota and other 
environmental factors1-4. It is difficult to connect differences in metabolism 
to genomic variation and derive underlying molecular mechanisms in humans, owing 
to differences in diet and lifestyle, among others. Here we use the nematode 
Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study inter-individual variation in 
metabolism. By comparing three wild strains and the commonly used N2 laboratory 
strain, we find differences in the abundances of both known metabolites and 
those that have not to our knowledge been previously described. The latter 
metabolites include conjugates between 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and several 
amino acids (3HP-AAs), which are much higher in abundance in one of the wild 
strains. 3HP is an intermediate in the propionate shunt pathway, which is 
activated when flux through the canonical, vitamin-B12-dependent propionate 
breakdown pathway is perturbed5. We show that increased accumulation of 3HP-AAs 
is caused by genetic variation in HPHD-1, for which 3HP is a substrate. Our 
results suggest that the production of 3HP-AAs represents a 
'shunt-within-a-shunt' pathway to accommodate a reduction-of-function allele in 
hphd-1. This study provides a step towards the development of metabolic network 
models that capture individual-specific differences of metabolism and more 
closely represent the diversity that is found in entire species.
