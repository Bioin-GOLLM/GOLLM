Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy or congenital 
hyperinsulinism of the neonate is a rare condition that may cause severe 
neurologic damage if the disease is unrecognized or inadequately treated. 
Current treatment aims to restore normal blood glucose levels by providing a 
carbohydrate-enriched diet and drugs that inhibit insulin secretion. If medical 
treatment fails, then surgery is required. Because congenital hyperinsulinism 
may be caused either by diffuse involvement of pancreatic beta-cells or by a 
focal cluster of abnormal beta-cells, the extent of pancreatectomy varies. We 
report on 2 patients with a focal form of the disease for whom diagnosis was 
made with laparoscopy. Laparoscopic enucleation of the lesion was curative.
