The wall teichoic acid (WTA) is the major carbohydrate found within the 
extracellular matrix of the Listeria monocytogenes biofilm. We first addressed 
the frequency of spontaneous mutations in two genes (lmo2549 and lmo2550) 
responsible for the GlcNAcylation in 93 serotype 1/2a strains that were mainly 
isolated from seafood industries. We studied the impact of mutations in lmo2549 
or lmo2550 genes on biofilm formation by using one mutant carrying a natural 
mutation inactivating the lmo2550 gene (DSS 1130 BFA2 strain) and two EGD-e 
mutants that lack respective genes by in-frame deletion of lmo2549 or lmo2550 
using splicing-by-overlap-extension PCR, followed by allelic exchange 
mutagenesis. The lmo2550 gene mutation, occurring in around 50% isolates, caused 
a decrease in bacterial adhesion to stainless steel compared to wild-type EGD-e 
strain during the adhesion step. On the other hand, bacterial population weren't 
significantly different after 24h-biofilm formation. The biofilm architecture 
was different between the wild-type strain and the two mutants inactivated for 
lmo2549 or lmo2550 genes respectively with the presence of bacterial 
micro-colonies for mutants which were not observed in the wild-type EGD-e strain 
biofilm. These differences might account for the stronger hydrophilic surface 
exhibited by the mutant cells. Upon a water flow or to a cleaning procedure at a 
shear stress of 0.16 Pa, the mutant biofilms showed the higher detachment rate 
compared to wild-type strain. Meanwhile, an increase in the amount of residual 
viable but non-culturable population on stainless steel was recorded in two 
mutants. Our data suggests that the GlcNAc residue of WTA played a role in 
adhesion and biofilm formation of Listeria monocyctogenes.
