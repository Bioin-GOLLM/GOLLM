Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that infects half of the 
world's population, causing gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. To 
establish chronic stomach infection, H. pylori utilizes chemotaxis, driven by a 
conserved signal transduction system. Chemotaxis allows H. pylori to sense an 
array of environmental and bacterial signals within the stomach, guiding its 
motility towards its preferred niche within the gastric mucosa and glands. 
Fine-tuned localization, regulated by the chemotaxis system, enables robust 
colonization during the acute stage of infection. During chronic infection, 
chemotaxis helps maintain bacterial populations and modulates the host immune 
response. Given its importance in host colonization and disease, chemotaxis is 
an attractive target for future treatments against H. pylori infections.
