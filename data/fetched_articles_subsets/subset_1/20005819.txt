Axon regeneration failure accounts for permanent functional deficits following 
CNS injury in adult mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. 
In analyzing axon regeneration in different mutant mouse lines, we discovered 
that deletion of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in adult retinal 
ganglion cells (RGCs) promotes robust regeneration of injured optic nerve axons. 
This regeneration-promoting effect is efficiently blocked in SOCS3-gp130 
double-knockout mice, suggesting that SOCS3 deletion promotes axon regeneration 
via a gp130-dependent pathway. Consistently, a transient upregulation of ciliary 
neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was observed within the retina following optic nerve 
injury. Intravitreal application of CNTF further enhances axon regeneration from 
SOCS3-deleted RGCs. Together, our results suggest that compromised 
responsiveness to injury-induced growth factors in mature neurons contributes 
significantly to regeneration failure. Thus, developing strategies to modulate 
negative signaling regulators may be an efficient strategy of promoting axon 
regeneration after CNS injury.
