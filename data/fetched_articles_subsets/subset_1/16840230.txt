The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach, being a relatively novel 
biophysical method, is used to detect many different targets by biomolecular 
interaction. The SPR system uses optical and evanescent wave phenomenon. This 
approach does not need any labels, such as enzymes or isotopes, and the 
monitored interactions are in real time. In DNA-DNA interaction, the SPR 
approach is Tm-independent. Here we report our preliminary results for the 
molecular detection of the Hb S (GAG -->GTG) mutation at codon 6 of the human 
beta-globin gene. Our preliminary results show that the SPR approach could be 
applied as an inexpensive and fast routine test system for the molecular 
diagnosis of abnormal hemoglobins (Hbs), especially in premarital screening 
programs.
