Mutationally activated Ras is one of the most common oncogenic drivers found 
across all malignancies, and its selective inhibition has long been a goal in 
both pharma and academia. One of the oldest and most validated methods to 
inhibit overactive Ras signaling is by interfering with its post-translational 
processing and subsequent cellular localization. Previous attempts to target Ras 
processing led to the development of farnesyltransferase inhibitors, which can 
inhibit H-Ras localization but not K-Ras due to its ability to bypass 
farnesyltransterase inhibition through alternative prenylation by 
geranylgeranyltransferase. Here, we present the creation of a neo-substrate for 
farnesyltransferase that prevents the alternative prenlation by 
geranylgeranyltransferase and mislocalizes oncogenic K-Ras in cells.
