PURPOSE: The inducible Cre-ERT2 recombinase system allows for temporal control 
of gene targeting, and it is useful to studying adult function of genes that 
have critical developmental roles. The Zeb1flox/flox: UBC-CreERT2 mouse was 
generated to conditionally target Zeb1 to investigate its role in mesenchymal 
transition in the mouse corneal endothelium in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hemizygous UBC-CreERT2 mice were crossed with homozygous 
mice harboring loxP-flanked Zeb1 alleles (Zeb1flox/flox) to generate the 
Zeb1flox/flox: UBC-CreERT2 mouse. 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) exposure leads to 
excision of exon 6 of Zeb1, resulting in a loss function allele in the 
Zeb1flox/flox: UBC-CreERT2 mouse. Intracameral 4-OHT injection further isolates 
Zeb1 targeting to the anterior chamber. Mesenchymal transition and induction of 
Zeb1 expression in the corneal endothelium was achieved using FGF2 in ex vivo 
organ culture. Gene expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction and by immunoblotting in the mouse 
corneal endothelium in vivo.
RESULTS: Following Cre-mediated targeting of Zeb1 by intracameral 4-OHT 
injection in Zeb1flox/flox: UBC-CreERT2 mice, FGF2 treatment in ex vivo organ 
culture resulted in abrogation of Zeb1 mRNA and protein expression in the 
corneal endothelium.
CONCLUSION: The data show Zeb1, a critical mediator of fibrosis in corneal 
endothelial mesenchymal transition, can be targeted by intracameral injection of 
4-OHT in the mouse corneal endothelium in vivo. These results suggest that genes 
with critical developmental roles can be targeted at a specific time in the 
corneal endothelium to study its role in adult disease using an inducible 
Cre-Lox strategy.
