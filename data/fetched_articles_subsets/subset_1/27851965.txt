Lipolysis provides metabolic fuel; however, aberrant adipose lipolysis results 
in ectopic lipid accumulation and lipotoxicity. While adipose triacylglycerol 
lipase (ATGL) catalyzes the first step of lipolysis, its regulation is not fully 
understood. Here, we demonstrate that adipocyte Snail1 suppresses both ATGL 
expression and lipolysis. Adipose Snail1 levels are higher in fed mice than in 
fasted mice and higher in obese mice as opposed to lean mice. Insulin increases 
Snail1 levels in both murine and human adipocytes, wherein Snail1 binds to the 
ATGL promoter to repress its expression. Importantly, adipocyte-specific 
deletion of Snail1 increases adipose ATGL expression and lipolysis, resulting in 
decreased fat mass and increased liver fat content in mice fed either a normal 
chow diet or a high-fat diet. Thus, we have identified a Snail1-ATGL axis that 
regulates adipose lipolysis and fatty acid release, thereby governing lipid 
partitioning between adipose and non-adipose tissues.
