BACKGROUND: To date, many studies have examined the correlation between 
Monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) intron 13 A/G polymorphisms and the susceptibility to 
Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the results of these studies are 
inconclusive.
METHODS: In order to confirm this correlation, a meta-analysis of 15 studies was 
performed and the dichotomous data are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Carriers of the MAOB intron 13 A allele were more likely to have PD 
than carriers of the G allele in the Asian population (OR = 1.182, 95% CI = 
1.012-1.380, p < 0.05). When combined with the COMT LL genotype, the MAOB intron 
13 AA/(A) genotype increased the risk of PD susceptibility more than with the GA 
genotype or GG + GA/(G) genotype (AA/(A) vs. GG + GA/(G): OR = 1.610, 95% CI = 
1.094-2.369; AA/(A) vs. GA: OR = 1.621, 95% CI = 1.004-2.619). Irrespective of 
whether individuals were in the AA/(A) genotype or GG + GA/(G) genotype 
subgroup, this meta-analysis indicated that smoking was a PD-preventive factor 
(AA/(A): OR = 1.823, 95% CI = 1.150-2.891; GG + GA/(G): OR = 2.245, 95% CI = 
1.277-3.948).
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that people with the MAOB 
intron 13 A allele have an increased risk of PD in the Asian population, 
especially when combined with the COMT LL genotype.
