BACKGROUND: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a common form of hearing loss 
that can be inherited or triggered by environmental insults; auditory neuropathy 
spectrum disorder (ANSD) is a SNHL subtype with unique diagnostic criteria. The 
genetic factors associated with these impairments are vast and diverse, but 
causal genetic factors are rarely characterized.
METHODS: A family dyad, both cochlear implant recipients, presented with a 
hearing history of bilateral, progressive SNHL, and ANSD. Whole-exome sequencing 
was performed to identify coding sequence variants shared by both family 
members, and screened against genes relevant to hearing loss and variants known 
to be associated with SNHL and ANSD.
RESULTS: Both family members are successful cochlear implant users, 
demonstrating effective auditory nerve stimulation with their devices. Genetic 
analyses revealed a mutation (rs35725509) in the TMTC2 gene, which has been 
reported previously as a likely genetic cause of SNHL in another family of 
Northern European descent.
CONCLUSION: This study represents the first confirmation of the rs35725509 
variant in an independent family as a likely cause for the complex hearing loss 
phenotype (SNHL and ANSD) observed in this family dyad.
