OBJECTIVE: To assess whether in Mexican population the frequencies of ATM 
polymorphisms IVS24-9delT, IVS38-8-T>C, and 5557G>A in breast cancer (BC) cases 
and healthy controls were different from those found in other countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Frequencies of polymorphisms conferring BC risk 
IVS24-9delT, IVS38-8T>C, and 5557G>A were analyzed by PCR-RFLP in 94 patients 
with familial and/or early onset BC, and 97 healthy controls randomly selected. 
Allele frequencies analysis was done using χ(2) and Hardy-Weinberg test.
RESULTS: Frequencies of heterozygous were: for 5557G>A, 13% cases, 0%controls 
(p=0.0009); for IVS24-9delT, 21% cases, 8% controls (p=0.0122); for IVS38-8T>C, 
only one case. 5557G>A and IVS24-9delT were more frequent in cases than in 
controls. The allelic frequencies found in 5557G>A are similar to those 
described by González-Hormazábal in Chile.
CONCLUSION: The similarity of results in this polymorphism between Chilean and 
Mexican populations may be due to both being crossbred with an 
Amerindian-Spanish component, while differences may be due to fact that Chilean 
population has a greater European component than Mexican's.
