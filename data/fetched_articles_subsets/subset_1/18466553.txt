BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is a mechanism in which the expression of a gene 
copy depends upon the sex of the parent from which it was inherited. This 
mechanism is now well recognized in humans, and the deregulation of imprinted 
genes has been implicated in a number of diseases. In this study, we performed a 
genome-wide joint linkage and imprinting scan using two data sets provided by 
Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 (GAW15).
RESULTS: The first data set was high-risk rheumatoid arthritis families 
collected by the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium. We used both 
model-based and model-free methods of joint linkage and imprinting analyses. 
Although a genome scan of rheumatoid arthritis families using 
GENEHUNTER-MODSCORE suggested regions that might be imprinted, further analyses 
using variance-components method failed to obtain significant signals of 
imprinting. The second data set was Problem 1 of GAW15, which included 
single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and gene expression data for Centre 
d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees. A previous genome-wide linkage scan 
identified loci that may be regulators of gene expression: our genome-wide joint 
linkage and imprinting scan using a variance-components approach found 
significant signals for linkage.
CONCLUSION: Our linkage scan results suggest that imprinted genes are unlikely 
to be involved in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis. However, for 
expression level of TGFBR3 gene, we found a point-wise p-value of 0.03 for 
imprinting, but increase in the LOD score did not meet the required threshold to 
reliably identify imprinting as the correct mode of inheritance in genome-wide 
linkage scans.
