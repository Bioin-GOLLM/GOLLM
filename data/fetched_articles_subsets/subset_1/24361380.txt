Neuropsychological endophenotype approach is an emerging strategy in 
schizophrenia research to understand and identify the functional importance of 
genetically transmitted, brain-based deficits present in this disorder. 
Accumulating evidence indicated that working memory deficit is a core 
neuropsychological dysfunction in schizophrenia and a primary endophenotype 
indexing the liability to develop schizophrenia. Genetic variation in ankyrin 3 
gene (ANK3) is likely to have widespread cognitive effects. Our previous study 
has identified a significant association of ANK3 SNPs and schizophrenia. In this 
study, we aimed to examine whether the schizophrenia-risk SNPs within ANK3 may 
affect working memory deficits in schizophrenia patients. Herein, we assess the 
working memory performance in 163 patients with first-episode, 
antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia and 42 sex, age-matched healthy subjects using 
N-back task. Two SNPs rs10761482 and rs10994336 were genotyped among the 
patients and 209 controls. Our results showed that schizophrenia patients showed 
significantly poorer performance than healthy controls on N-back task (ps<0.01). 
After adjusting for the scores of intelligence quotient, memory quotient and the 
demographic factors, there was a significant genotype effect of the rs10994336 
on the accuracy rate and reaction time of 2-back item (p=0.048 and 0.024, 
respectively). Post-hoc analyses showed that patients with rs10994336T/T 
genotype had significantly lower accuracy rate and more reaction time at 2-back 
task than those with T/C and C/C genotypes. The association of SNP rs10994336 
with schizophrenia was replicated in our sample (genotypic p=0.024 and allelic 
p=0.006). However, we did not find any significant association of rs10761482 
with schizophrenia and parameters in N-back task. Our results indicated that 
genetic variation within ANK3 may exert gene-specific modulating effects on 
working memory deficits in schizophrenia.
