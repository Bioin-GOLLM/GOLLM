Genome-wide association studies have revealed a locus at 8p12 that is associated 
with breast cancer risk. Fine-mapping of this locus identified 16 candidate 
causal variants (CCVs). However, as these variants are intergenic, their 
function is unclear. To map chromatin looping from this risk locus to a 
previously identified candidate target gene, DUSP4, we performed chromatin 
conformation capture analyses in normal and tumoural breast cell lines. We 
identified putative regulatory elements, containing CCVs, which looped to the 
DUSP4 promoter region. Using reporter gene assays, we found that the risk allele 
of CCV rs7461885 reduced the activity of a DUSP4 enhancer element, consistent 
with the function of DUSP4 as a tumour suppressor gene. Furthermore, the risk 
allele of CCV rs12155535, located in another DUSP4 enhancer element, was 
negatively correlated with looping of this element to the DUSP4 promoter region, 
suggesting that this allele would be associated with reduced expression. These 
findings provide the first evidence that CCV risk alleles downregulate DUSP4 
expression, suggesting that this gene is a regulatory target of the 8p12 breast 
cancer risk locus.
