Shortly after entering the cell, HIV-1 copies its genomic RNA into 
double-stranded DNA in a process known as reverse transcription. This process 
starts inside a core consisting of an enclosed lattice of capsid proteins that 
protect the viral RNA from cytosolic sensors and degradation pathways. To 
accomplish reverse transcription and integrate cDNA into the host cell genome, 
the capsid shell needs to be disassembled, or uncoated. Premature or delayed 
uncoating attenuates reverse transcription and blocks HIV-1 infectivity. Small 
molecules that bind to the capsid lattice of the HIV-1 core and either 
destabilize or stabilize its structure could thus function as effective HIV-1 
inhibitors. To screen for such compounds, we modified our recently developed 
FAITH assay to allow direct assessment of the stability of in vitro preassembled 
HIV-1 capsid-nucleocapsid (CANC) tubular particles. This new assay is a 
high-throughput fluorescence method based on measuring the amount of nucleic 
acid released from CANC complexes under disassembly conditions. The amount of 
disassembled CANC particles and released nucleic acid is proportional to the 
fluorescence signal, from which the relative percentage of CANC stability can be 
calculated. We consider our assay a potentially powerful tool for in vitro 
screening for compounds that alter HIV disassembly.
