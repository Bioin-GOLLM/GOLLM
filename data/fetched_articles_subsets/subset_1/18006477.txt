AIMS: Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiac disorder 
characterized by left ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic contraction. 
It is a major cause of heart failure and heart transplantation. DCM is of 
genetic origin in approximately 30% of cases and genetically heterogeneous with 
the identification of numerous disease genes. However, many new disease genes 
remain to be discovered. Focusing on gene products located in the sarcomere of 
cardiomyocytes as disease-causing candidates, we screened the gene encoding the 
sarcomeric Z-band protein myopalladin (MYPN, OMIM 608517) for mutation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced the coding region in 114 (65 familial and 49 
sporadic cases) independent DCM patients' DNA and functionally analysed the 
identified mutations. We identified four independent heterozygous mutations in 
two families (R1088H and I83fsX105) and two sporadic cases (V1195M, P1112L). For 
the three missense mutations, the substituted amino acids were conserved among 
species. All mutations were absent from 400 control subjects. Specific 
immunolabelling of heart tissue from a proband carrying the R1088H mutation 
showed a decreased localization of myopalladin at the Z-band area of left 
ventricular cardiac myofibrils. Analysis of the effects of the mutations after 
transfection in rat neonate cardiomyocytes indicated sarcomere disorganization 
and premature cell death associated with the V1195M and P1112L myopalladin 
expression. Allele-specific expression analysis of mRNA from a patient 
harbouring the I83fsX105 mutation indicated the absence of the mutated 
transcript, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism.
CONCLUSION: Based on genetic, histological, and functional evidence, we 
identified a new gene associated with DCM and observed mutations in 3-4% of 
cases in a population of European descent.
