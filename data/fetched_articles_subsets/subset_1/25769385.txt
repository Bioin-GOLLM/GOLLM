BACKGROUND: Malfunction in the energy homeostasis system is a major cause of 
developing obesity. Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) plays a crucial role in this 
system as a key receptor. Although MC4R gene as an obesity candidate gene is 
associated with higher BMI, only few attempts have been carried out to 
understand the mechanism underlying body-weight regulation.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between 
variant rs17782313 near MC4R gene and both dietary energy and macronutrient 
intakes.
METHODS: An Iranian population, 400 adults aged over 22years were selected from 
the Iranian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (IMOS). Genotyping for the near MC4R 
rs17782313 was performed by PCR-RFLP. Weight and height were measured. Dietary 
intake and physical activity were assessed by using validated questionnaires. 
Analysis was carried out in two groups with regard to BMI. Multiple linear 
regression models adjusted for covariates were used to examine the association 
between rs17782313 and dietary intake.
RESULTS: MC4R rs17782313 was associated with high energy intake (P<0.001), and 
low carbohydrate and protein intakes (P<0.001 and P<0.01 respectively). In 
addition, the significant association between variant rs17782313 and fat intake 
disappeared after adjusting for energy.
CONCLUSIONS: The rs17782313 variant contributes to the variety of dietary energy 
and energy-dense macronutrient intakes. Moreover, a novel association was 
suggested between this polymorphism and dietary fat intake.
