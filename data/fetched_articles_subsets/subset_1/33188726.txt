Erlotinib is highly effective in lung cancer patients with epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, despite initial favorable responses, 
most patients rapidly develop resistance to erlotinib soon after the initial 
treatment. This study aims to identify new genes and pathways associated with 
erlotinib resistance mechanisms in order to develop novel therapeutic 
strategies. Here, we induced knockout (KO) mutations in erlotinib-resistant 
human lung cancer cells (NCI-H820) using a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA 
library to screen for genes involved in erlotinib susceptibility. The spectrum 
of sgRNAs incorporated among erlotinib-treated cells was substantially different 
to that of the untreated cells. Gene set analyses showed a significant depletion 
of 'cell cycle process' and 'protein ubiquitination pathway' genes among 
erlotinib-treated cells. Chemical inhibitors targeting genes in these two 
pathways, such as nutlin-3 and carfilzomib, increased cancer cell death when 
combined with erlotinib in both in vitro cell line and in vivo patient-derived 
xenograft experiments. Therefore, we propose that targeting cell cycle processes 
or protein ubiquitination pathways are promising treatment strategies for 
overcoming resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer.
