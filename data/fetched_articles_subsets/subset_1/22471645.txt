According to a recent report by Sunami et al., a maternally inherited Japanese 
family with variable phenotypes including mitochondrial myopathy, recurrent 
headache, and myoclonus and epilepsy had been described to be associated with 
mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) 3291T>C mutation. In order to verify this 
association, we reanalyzed the clinical and molecular datasets obtained from 
Sunami's work; in addition, a phylogenetic approach was employed to evaluate the 
conservation index of this mutation among different species. We further utilized 
RNA Fold Web Server to predict the minimum free energy (MFE) of tRNA(Leu(UUR)) 
gene with and without this mutation. Most strikingly, a low level of 
conservation was found regarding 3291T>C mutation and a slight change in MFE had 
been observed between the wild type and the mutant. Our negative results gave no 
support for an active role for this mutation on the clinical expression of 
mitochondrial disorders.
