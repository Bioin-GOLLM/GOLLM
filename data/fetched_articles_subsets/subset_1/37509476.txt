BACKGROUND: Somatic TP53 mutations are frequent in head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (HNSCC) and are important pathogenic factors.
OBJECTIVE: To study TP53 mutations relative to the presence of human 
papillomavirus (HPV) in tumors in HNSCC patients.
METHODS: Using a custom-made next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel on 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, we analyzed somatic TP53 
mutations and the TP53 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) codon 72 (P72R; 
rs1042522) (proline â†’ arginine) from 104 patients with HNSCC.
RESULTS: Only 2 of 44 patients with HPV-positive (HPV(+)) HNSCC had a TP53 
somatic mutation, as opposed to 42/60 HPV-negative (HPV(-)) HNSCC patients (p < 
0.001). Forty-five different TP53 somatic mutations were detected. Furthermore, 
in HPV(-) patients, we determined an 80% prevalence of somatic TP53 mutations in 
the TP53 R72 polymorphism cohort versus 40% in the TP53 P72 cohort (p = 0.001). 
A higher percentage of patients with oral cavity SCC had TP53 mutations than 
HPV(-) oropharyngeal (OP) SCC patients (p = 0.012). Furthermore, 39/44 HPV(+) 
tumor patients harbored the TP53 R72 polymorphism in contrast to 42/60 patients 
in the HPV(-) group (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that TP53 R72 polymorphism is associated with 
a tumor being HPV(+). We also report a higher percentage of somatic TP53 
mutations with R72 than P72 in HPV(-) HNSCC patients.
