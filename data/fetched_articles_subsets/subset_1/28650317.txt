ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins 
that controls many cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, 
chromatin regulation and mitosis. A number of proteins catalyse the transfer and 
hydrolysis of ADPr, and also specify how and when the modification is conjugated 
to the targets. We recently discovered a new form of ADPr that is attached to 
serine residues in target proteins (Ser-ADPr) and showed that this PTM is 
specifically made by PARP1/HPF1 and PARP2/HPF1 complexes. In this work, we found 
by quantitative proteomics that histone Ser-ADPr is reversible in cells during 
response to DNA damage. By screening for the hydrolase that is responsible for 
the reversal of Ser-ADPr, we identified ARH3/ADPRHL2 as capable of efficiently 
and specifically removing Ser-ADPr of histones and other proteins. We further 
showed that Ser-ADPr is a major PTM in cells after DNA damage and that this 
signalling is dependent on ARH3.
