Organophosphorus (OP) compounds, including nerve agents and some pesticides, 
covalently bind to the catalytic serine of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE), 
thereby inhibiting acetylcholine hydrolysis necessary for efficient 
neurotransmission. Oxime antidotes can reactivate the OP-conjugated hAChE, but 
reactivation efficiency can be low for pesticides, such as paraoxon (POX). 
Understanding structural and dynamic determinants of OP inhibition and 
reactivation can provide insights to design improved reactivators. Here, X-ray 
structures of hAChE with unaged POX, with POX and oximes MMB4 and RS170B, and 
with MMB4 are reported. A significant conformational distortion of the acyl loop 
was observed upon POX binding, being partially restored to the native 
conformation by oximes. Neutron vibrational spectroscopy combined with molecular 
dynamics simulations showed that picosecond vibrational dynamics of the acyl 
loop soften in the ∼20-50 cm-1 frequency range. The acyl loop structural 
perturbations may be correlated with its picosecond vibrational dynamics to 
yield more comprehensive template for structure-based reactivator design.
