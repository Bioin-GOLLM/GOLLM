Selective oxidation reactions represent a challenging task for conventional 
organic chemistry. Whole-cell biocatalysis provides a very convenient, easy to 
apply method to carry out different selective oxidation reactions including 
chemo-, regio-, and enantio-selective reactions. Streptomyces species are 
important biocatalysts as they can catalyze these selective reactions very 
efficiently owing to the wide diversity of enzymes and enzymatic cascades in 
their cell niche. In this review, we present and analyze most of the examples 
reported to date of oxidative reactions catalyzed by Streptomyces species as 
whole-cell biocatalysts. We discuss 33 different Streptomyces species and 
strains and the role they play in different oxidative reactions over the past 
five decades. The oxidative reactions have been classified into seven categories 
that include: hydroxylation of steroids/non-steroids, asymmetric sulfoxidations, 
oxidation of aldehydes, multi-step oxidations, oxidative cleavage, and 
N-oxidations. The role played by Streptomyces species as recombinant hosts 
catalyzing bio-oxidations has also been highlighted.
