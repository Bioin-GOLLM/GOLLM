The aim of the study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in genes encoding 
Toll-like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) may modify relative risk for development of 
asthma or allergic rhinitis. The results showed that the genotype and allele 
frequencies of the TLR2 Arg753Gln and TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphisms were not 
significantly different between asthmatic children or allergic rhinitis when 
compared to controls (p>0.05 for each) or even when compared further with IgE 
level. However, it was shown that the mutant allele of TLR2 or TLR4 
polymorphisms were significantly associated with the moderate-severe group 
compared to the mild group in both atopic asthmatics and allergic rhinitis group 
(p>0.001 for each). In conclusion, our study demonstrates a lack of association 
of TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms with asthma and allergic rhinitis but suggests 
significant association between these genetic variants and the disease severity.
