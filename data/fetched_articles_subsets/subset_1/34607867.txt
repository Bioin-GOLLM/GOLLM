OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between coagulation parameters and 
severity of anaemia (moderate anaemia: haemoglobin (Hb) 7-9.9 g/dL and severe 
anaemia: Hb <7 g/dL) during pregnancy and relate these to postpartum haemorrhage 
(PPH) at childbirth.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of pregnant women recruited in the third 
trimester and followed-up after childbirth.
SETTING: Ten hospitals across four states in India.
PARTICIPANTS: 1342 pregnant women.
INTERVENTION: Not applicable.
METHODS: Hb and coagulation parameters: fibrinogen, D-dimer, D-dimer/fibrinogen 
ratio, platelets and international normalised ratio (INR) were measured at 
baseline. Participants were followed-up to measure blood loss within 2 hours 
after childbirth and PPH was defined based on blood loss and clinical 
assessment. Associations between coagulation parameters, Hb, anaemia and PPH 
were examined using multivariable logistic regression models.
OUTCOMES MEASURES: Adjusted OR with 95% CI.
RESULTS: In women with severe anaemia during the third trimester, the D-dimer 
was 27% higher, mean fibrinogen 117 mg/dL lower, D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio 69% 
higher and INR 12% higher compared with women with no/mild anaemia. Mean 
platelets in severe anaemia was 37.8×109/L lower compared with women with 
moderate anaemia. Similar relationships with smaller effect sizes were 
identified for women with moderate anaemia compared with women with no/mild 
anaemia. Low Hb and high INR at third trimester of pregnancy independently 
increased the odds of PPH at childbirth, but the other coagulation parameters 
were not found to be significantly associated with PPH.
CONCLUSION: Altered blood coagulation profile in pregnant women with severe 
anaemia could be a risk factor for PPH and requires further evaluation.
