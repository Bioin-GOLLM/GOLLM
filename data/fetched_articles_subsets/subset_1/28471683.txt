The platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) signaling pathway is a 
validated and important target for the treatment of certain malignant and 
nonmalignant pathologies. We previously identified a G-quadruplex-forming 
nuclease hypersensitive element (NHE) in the human PDGFR-β promoter that 
putatively forms four overlapping G-quadruplexes. Therefore, we further 
investigated the structures and biological roles of the G-quadruplexes and 
i-motifs in the PDGFR-β NHE with the ultimate goal of demonstrating an alternate 
and effective strategy for molecularly targeting the PDGFR-β pathway. 
Significantly, we show that the primary G-quadruplex receptor for repression of 
PDGFR-β is the 3'-end G-quadruplex, which has a GGA sequence at the 3'-end. 
Mutation studies using luciferase reporter plasmids highlight a novel set of 
G-quadruplex point mutations, some of which seem to provide conflicting results 
on effects on gene expression, prompting further investigation into the effect 
of these mutations on the i-motif-forming strand. Herein we characterize the 
formation of an equilibrium between at least two different i-motifs from the 
cytosine-rich (C-rich) sequence of the PDGFR-β NHE. The apparently conflicting 
mutation results can be rationalized if we take into account the single base 
point mutation made in a critical cytosine run in the PDGFR-β NHE that 
dramatically affects the equilibrium of i-motifs formed from this sequence. We 
identified a group of ellipticines that targets the G-quadruplexes in the 
PDGFR-β promoter, and from this series of compounds, we selected the ellipticine 
analog GSA1129, which selectively targets the 3'-end G-quadruplex, to shift the 
dynamic equilibrium in the full-length sequence to favor this structure. We also 
identified a benzothiophene-2-carboxamide (NSC309874) as a PDGFR-β 
i-motif-interactive compound. In vitro, GSA1129 and NSC309874 downregulate 
PDGFR-β promoter activity and transcript in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH 
at subcytotoxic cell concentrations. GSA1129 also inhibits PDGFR-β-driven cell 
proliferation and migration. With an established preclinical murine model of 
acute lung injury, we demonstrate that GSA1129 attenuates endotoxin-mediated 
acute lung inflammation. Our studies underscore the importance of considering 
the effects of point mutations on structure formation from the G- and C-rich 
sequences and provide further evidence for the involvement of both strands and 
associated structures in the control of gene expression.
