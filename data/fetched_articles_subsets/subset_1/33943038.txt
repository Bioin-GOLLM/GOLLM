Chronic nontuberculous mycobacterial infections with Mycobacterium avium and 
Mycobacterium intracellulare complicate bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive 
airway disease, and the health of aging individuals. These insidious 
intracellular pathogens cause considerable morbidity and eventual mortality in 
individuals colonized with these bacteria. Current treatment regimens with 
antibiotic macrolides are both toxic and often inefficient at providing 
infection resolution. In this article, we demonstrate that human marrow-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells are antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory in vitro and in 
the context of an in vivo sustained infection of either M. avium and/or 
M. intracellulare.
