PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferas 
(LCAT)-based therapeutic approaches for atherosclerosis, acute coronary 
syndrome, and LCAT deficiency disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: A wide variety of approaches to using LCAT as a novel 
therapeutic target have been proposed. Enzyme replacement therapy with 
recombinant human LCAT is the most clinically advanced therapy for 
atherosclerosis and familial LCAT deficiency (FLD), with Phase I and Phase 2A 
clinical trials recently completed. Liver-directed LCAT gene therapy and 
engineered cell therapies are also another promising approach. Peptide and small 
molecule activators have shown efficacy in early-stage preclinical studies. 
Finally, lifestyle modifications, such as fat-restricted diets, cessation of 
cigarette smoking, and a diet rich in antioxidants may potentially suppress 
lipoprotein abnormalities in FLD patients and help preserve LCAT activity and 
renal function but have not been adequately tested.
SUMMARY: Preclinical and early-stage clinical trials demonstrate the promise of 
novel LCAT therapies as HDL-raising agents that may be used to treat not only 
FLD but potentially also atherosclerosis and other disorders with low or 
dysfunctional HDL.
