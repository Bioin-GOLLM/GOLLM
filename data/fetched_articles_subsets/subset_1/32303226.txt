BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major challenge for public health 
due to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and premature death. The 
aim of this study was to determine the clinical picture of FA and the course of 
the pathophysiological mechanisms of CKD.
METHODS: The study involved 149 patients with CKD and a control group including 
43 people. Fatty acid profiles were investigated using gas chromatography. A 
total of 30 fatty acids and their derivatives were identified and quantified. 
The omega3, omega6, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA fatty acid contents were calculated. The 
correlation matrix was obtained for parameters relating to patients with CKD vs. 
FA, taking patients' sex into consideration. The index C18:3n6/C22:4n6 was 
calculated according to the length of the treatment. Statistica 12.0 software 
(Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA) was used for the statistical analyses.
RESULTS: The results showed decreased levels of total PUFA and increased 
concentrations of MUFA, including the activation of the palmitic and oleic acid 
pathway. An increase in the levels of n-6 9C22: 4n6 family fatty acids in all 
the patients and a reduction in the n-3 family (EPA, DHA) were observed. C18:3n6 
was negatively correlated and C22:4n6 was positively correlated with the 
duration of the treatment. The index C18:3n6/C22:4n6 was defined as a new marker 
in the progression of the disease. Moreover, the index C18:3n6/ C22:4n6 was 
drastically decreased in later period. Nervonic acid was higher in the CKD 
group. In the group of men with CKD, there was a negative correlation between 
the excretion of K+, anthropometric measurements, and the levels of EPA and DHA.
CONCLUSIONS: The course of inflammation in CKD occurs through the decrease in 
PUFA and the synthesis of MUFA. The dominating cascade of changes is the 
elongation of GLA-C18:3n6 into DGLA-C20:3n6 and AA-C20:4n6. As CKD progresses, 
along with worsening anthropometrical parameters and increased secretion of 
potassium, the activity of Ʌ6-desaturase decreases, reducing the synthesis of 
EPA and DHA. The synthesis of AdA-C22:4n6 increases and the ratio 
C18:3n6/C22:4n6 drastically decreases after 5 years. This parameter can be used 
to diagnose disease progression.
