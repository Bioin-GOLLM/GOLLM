BACKGROUND: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which are responsible for 10% of 
spontaneous mouse mutations, are kept under control via several epigenetic 
mechanisms. The H3K9 histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is essential for ERV 
repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), with DNA methylation also playing an 
important role. It has been suggested that SETDB1 protects ERVs from 
TET-dependent DNA demethylation, but the relevance of this mechanism for ERV 
expression remains unclear. Moreover, previous studies have been performed in 
primed ESCs, which are not epigenetically or transcriptionally representative of 
preimplantation embryos.
RESULTS: We use naïve ESCs to investigate the role of SETDB1 in ERV regulation 
and its relationship with TET-mediated DNA demethylation. Naïve ESCs show an 
increased dependency on SETDB1 for ERV silencing when compared to primed ESCs, 
including at the highly mutagenic intracisternal A particles (IAPs). We find 
that in the absence of SETDB1, TET2 activates IAP elements in a 
catalytic-dependent manner. Surprisingly, TET2 does not drive changes in DNA 
methylation levels at IAPs, suggesting that it regulates these retrotransposons 
indirectly. Instead, SETDB1 depletion leads to a TET2-dependent loss of 
H4R3me2s, which is indispensable for IAP silencing during epigenetic 
reprogramming.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a novel and unexpected role for SETDB1 in 
protecting IAPs from TET2-dependent histone arginine demethylation.
