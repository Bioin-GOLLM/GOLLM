Phytochemical investigation of the heartwood of Michelia compressa afforded 
forty-four compounds, which were identified by comparison of experimental and 
literature analytical and spectroscopic data. Some compounds were evaluated for 
their anti-inflammatory and anticancer bioactivities. The result showed that 
soemerine (1) and cyathisterol (2) exhibited significant nitric oxide (NO) 
inhibition, with IC50 values of 8.5±0.3 and 9.6±0.5 µg/mL, respectively. In 
addition, liriodenine (3) and oliveroline (4) exhibited cytotoxicity to human 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC-TW01), non-small cell lung carcinoma (NCI-H226), T 
cell leukemia (Jurkat), renal carcinoma (A498), lung carcinoma (A549) and 
fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 15.7-3.68 μM.
