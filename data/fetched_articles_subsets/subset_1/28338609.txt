We report here the isolation and functional analysis of AlTMP1 gene encoding a 
member of the PMP3 protein family. In Aeluropus littoralis, AlTMP1 is highly 
induced by abscisic acid (ABA), cold, salt, and osmotic stresses. Transgenic 
tobacco expressing AlTMP1 exhibited enhanced tolerance to salt, osmotic, H₂O₂, 
heat and freezing stresses at the seedling stage. Under greenhouse conditions, 
the transgenic plants showed a higher level of tolerance to drought than to 
salinity. Noteworthy, AlTMP1 plants yielded two- and five-fold more seeds than 
non-transgenic plants (NT) under salt and drought stresses, respectively. The 
leaves of AlTMP1 plants accumulated lower Na⁺ but higher K⁺ and Ca2+ than those 
of NT plants. Tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses was associated with higher 
membrane stability, low electrolyte leakage, and improved water status. Finally, 
accumulation of AlTMP1 in tobacco altered the regulation of some stress-related 
genes in either a positive (NHX1, CAT1, APX1, and DREB1A) or negative (HKT1 and 
KT1) manner that could be related to the observed tolerance. These results 
suggest that AlTMP1 confers stress tolerance in tobacco through maintenance of 
ion homeostasis, increased membrane integrity, and water status. The observed 
tolerance may be due to a direct or indirect effect of AlTMP1 on the expression 
of stress-related genes which could stimulate an adaptive potential not present 
in NT plants.
