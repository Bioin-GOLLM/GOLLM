The adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 increases the turning behaviour 
induced by L-dopa in unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In 
this study we have evaluated the effect of a chronic intermittent administration 
of L-dopa or SCH 58261 plus L-dopa on turning behaviour. Chronic intermittent 
administration of SCH 58261 plus L-dopa produced a stable turning behaviour 
during the course of the treatment, whereas L-dopa alone produced a progressive 
increase in turning behaviour. Moreover, repeated administration of SCH 58261 
failed to produce tolerance to its ability to potentiate L-dopa-induced turning 
behaviour. The results indicate that SCH 58261 is effective after chronic 
administration and suggest that SCH 58261 plus L-dopa, differently from Ldopa 
alone, does not produce alterations in motor responses during the course of the 
treatment.
