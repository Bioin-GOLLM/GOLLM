OBJECTIVE: Attacks of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) are usually associated 
with transient, completely reversible symptoms. Here, we studied the ATP1A2 FHM2 
gene in a young girl with episodes of both very severe and transient 
neurological symptoms that were triggered by mild head trauma as well as 
permanent mental retardation. Her family members suffered from hemiplegic and 
confusional migraine attacks.
METHODS: Mutation analysis of the ATP1A2 gene was performed by direct sequencing 
of all exons and flanking intronic regions, using genomic DNA of the proband. 
Functional consequences of the mutation were analyzed by cellular survival 
assays.
RESULTS: We identified a novel G615R ATP1A2 mutation in the proband and several 
of her family members. Functional analysis of mutant Na,K-ATPase in cellular 
survival assays showed a complete loss-of-function effect.
INTERPRETATION: Permanent mental retardation in children may be caused by ATP1A2 
mutations.
