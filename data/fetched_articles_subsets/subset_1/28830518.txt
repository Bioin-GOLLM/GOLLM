BACKGROUND: Patient data, such as electronic health records or adverse event 
reporting systems, constitute an essential resource for studying Adverse Drug 
Events (ADEs). We explore an original approach to identify frequently associated 
ADEs in subgroups of patients.
RESULTS: Because ADEs have complex manifestations, we use formal concept 
analysis and its pattern structures, a mathematical framework that allows 
generalization using domain knowledge formalized in medical ontologies. Results 
obtained with three different settings and two different datasets show that this 
approach is flexible and allows extraction of association rules at various 
levels of generalization.
CONCLUSIONS: The chosen approach permits an expressive representation of a 
patient ADEs. Extracted association rules point to distinct ADEs that occur in a 
same group of patients, and could serve as a basis for a recommandation system. 
The proposed representation is flexible and can be extended to make use of 
additional ontologies and various patient records.
