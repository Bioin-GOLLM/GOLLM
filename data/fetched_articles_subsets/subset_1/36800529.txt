CRISPR/Cas9 system has been applied as an effective genome-targeting technology. 
By fusing deaminases with Cas9 nickase (nCas9), various cytosine and adenine 
base editors (CBEs and ABEs) have been successfully developed that can 
efficiently induce nucleotide conversions and install pathogenic single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cultured cells and animal models. However, the 
applications of BEs are frequently limited by the specific protospacer adjacent 
motif (PAM) sequences and protein sizes. To expand the toolbox for BEs that can 
recognize novel PAM sequences, we cloned a Cas9 ortholog from Streptococcus 
sinensis (named as SsiCas9) with a smaller size and constructed it into APOBEC1- 
or APOBEC3A-composed CBEs and TadA or TadA*-composed ABEs, which yield high 
editing efficiencies, low off-targeting activities, and low indel rates in human 
cells. Compared to PAMless SpRY Cas9-composed BE4max, SsiCas9-mediated BE4max 
displayed higher editing efficiencies for targets with "NNAAAA" PAM sequences. 
Moreover, SsiCas9-mediated BE4max induced highly efficient C-to-T conversions in 
the mouse Ar gene (R841C) to introduce a human androgen resistance 
syndrome-related mutation (AR R820C) in early mouse embryos. Thus, we developed 
novel BEs mediated by SsiCas9, expanded the toolbox for base conversions, and 
broadened the range of editable genomes in vitro and in vivo.
