Molecular epidemiological investigations have uncovered the patterns of 
emergence and global spread of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine 
and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Malaria parasites highly resistant to chloroquine 
and pyrimethamine spread from Asian origins to Africa, at great cost to human 
health and life. If artemisinin-resistant falciparum malaria follows the same 
pattern, renewed efforts to eliminate and eradicate malaria will be gravely 
threatened. This paper, adapted from a talk given in honour of Professor Malcolm 
Molyneux in Liverpool in September 2008, reviews the rise and fall of clinically 
important forms of drug-resistant falciparum malaria and considers how lessons 
learned from studying the evolution of drug-resistant malaria can be applied to 
efforts to prevent and deter resistance.
