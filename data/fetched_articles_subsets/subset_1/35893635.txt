Frataxin plays a key role in cellular iron homeostasis of different organisms. 
It has been implicated in iron storage, detoxification, delivery for Fe-S 
cluster assembly and heme biosynthesis. However, its specific role in iron 
metabolism remains unclear, especially in photosynthetic organisms. To gain 
insight into the role and properties of frataxin in algae, we identified the 
gene CreFH1, which codes for the frataxin homolog from Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii. We performed the cloning, expression and biochemical 
characterization of CreFH1. This protein has a predicted mitochondrial transit 
peptide and a significant structural similarity to other members of the frataxin 
family. In addition, CreFH1 was able to form a dimer in vitro, and this effect 
was increased by the addition of Cu2+ and also attenuated the Fenton reaction in 
the presence of a mixture of Fe2+ and H2O2. Bacterial cells with overexpression 
of CreFH1 showed increased growth in the presence of different metals, such as 
Fe, Cu, Zn and Ni and H2O2. Thus, results indicated that CreFH1 is a functional 
protein that shows some distinctive features compared to its more well-known 
counterparts, and would play an important role in response to oxidative stress 
in C. reinhardtii.
