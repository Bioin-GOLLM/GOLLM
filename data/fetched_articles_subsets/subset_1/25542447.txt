Many patients with BRAF inhibitor resistance can develop disease at new sites, 
suggesting that drug-induced selection pressure drives metastasis. Here, we used 
mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic screening to uncover ligand-independent 
EPHA2 signaling as an adaptation to BRAF inhibitor therapy that led to the 
adoption of a metastatic phenotype. The EPHA2-mediated invasion was 
AKT-dependent and readily reversible upon removal of the drug as well as through 
PI3K and AKT inhibition. In xenograft models, BRAF inhibition led to the 
development of EPHA2-positive metastases. A retrospective analysis of patients 
with melanoma on BRAF inhibitor therapy showed that 68% of those failing therapy 
develop metastases at new disease sites, compared with 35% of patients on 
dacarbazine. Further IHC staining of melanoma specimens taken from patients on 
BRAF inhibitor therapy as well as metastatic samples taken from patients failing 
therapy showed increased EPHA2 staining. We suggest that inhibition of 
ligand-independent EPHA2 signaling may limit metastases associated with BRAF 
inhibitor therapy.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides evidence that BRAF inhibition promotes the 
adoption of a reversible, therapy-driven metastatic phenotype in melanoma. The 
cotargeting of ligand-independent EPHA2 signaling and BRAF may be one strategy 
to prevent the development of therapy-mediated disease at new sites.
