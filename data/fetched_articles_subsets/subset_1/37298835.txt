Molecular docking is widely used in the assessment of the therapeutic potential 
of pharmaceutical agents. The binding properties of beta-carotene (BC) to 
acetylcholine esterase (AChE) proteins were characterized using the molecular 
docking method. The mechanism of AChE inhibition was assessed by an experimental 
in vitro kinetic study. In addition, the role of BC action was tested by the 
zebrafish embryo toxicity test (ZFET). The results of the docking ability of BC 
to AChE showed significant ligand binding mode. The kinetic parameter, i.e., the 
low AICc value shown as the compound was the competitive type of inhibition of 
AChE. Further, BC also showed mild toxicity at a higher dose (2200 mg/L) in ZFET 
assessment with changes in biomarkers. The LC50 value of BC is 1811.94 mg/L. 
Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) plays a pivotal role in the hydrolysis of 
acetylcholine, which leads to the development of cognitive dysfunction. BC 
possesses the regulation of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and acid phosphatase 
(AP) activity to prevent neurovascular dysfunction. Therefore, the 
characterization of BC could be used as a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment 
of cholinergic neurotoxicity-associated neurovascular disorders such as 
developmental toxicity, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease due to its 
AChE and AP inhibitory actions.
