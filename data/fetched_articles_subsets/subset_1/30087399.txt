In this paper, we report a proof of concept study on the fabrication, 
characterization and therapeutic evaluation of in vitro transcribed messenger 
RNA (mRNA) loaded in a dissolving microneedle patch (RNApatch). We show that low 
molecular weight polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) can directly be used without further 
purification for RNApatch fabrication with no detectable mRNA degradation. 
Physical and functional integrity of mRNA stored within the RNApatch are 
completely preserved for at least 2 weeks under ambient conditions. While the 
loading of mRNA into RNApatch is limited by the solubility of mRNA in 
concentrated PVP solution, mechanical strength of RNApatch is not compromised by 
the presence of mRNA. RNApatch can mediate in vivo transgene expression of mRNA 
encoding luciferase for up to 72â€‰hours and transfection efficiency and kinetics 
mediated by RNApatch compares favorably to subcutaneous injection. 
Interestingly, mRNA transfection efficiency does not correlate with contact 
surface area but instead increases with deeper delivery depths. In an E.G7-OVA 
immunotherapy model, RNApatch induces slightly higher cellular and humoral 
immune responses compared to subcutaneous injection. In conclusion, RNApatch is 
a viable delivery platform for mRNA and represents an attractive option with 
significant translation potential for the delivery of mRNA therapeutics.
