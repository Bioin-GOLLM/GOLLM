Considerable strides have been made over the past 20 years in our understanding 
of the ligands, receptor subtypes, signal transduction mechanisms and biological 
actions comprising the endocannabinoid system. From the ever-expanding number of 
studies that have been conducted during this time, it has become increasingly 
clear that sex differences are the cornerstone of cannabinoid-regulated biology. 
Available evidence has demonstrated that these sex differences endure in the 
absence of gonadal steroids, and are modulated by the acute, activational 
effects of these hormones. This review focuses on select aspects of sexually 
differentiated, cannabinoid-regulated biology, with a particular emphasis on the 
control of energy balance. It is anticipated that it will lend impactful insight 
into the pervasive and diverse disparities in how males and females respond to 
cannabinoids--from the organismal level down to the molecular level. 
Additionally, it will furnish a newfound appreciation for the need to 
recalibrate our thinking in terms of how cannabinoids are used as therapeutic 
adjuvants for a broad range of clinical disorders and associated comorbidities, 
including body wasting and obesity.
