BACKGROUND: This prospective study was designed to investigate the association 
between ten circulating inflammatory biomarkers and the risk for early stage 
lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: All inflammatory biomarkers were measured in 228 patients with early 
stage (IA to IIB) lung adenocarcinoma and 228 age-, sex- and smoking-matched 
healthy controls by using the Luminex bead-based assay.
RESULTS: Only two biomarkers were significantly associated with the risk of 
early stage lung adenocarcinoma after the Bonferroni correction: the 
multivariate odd ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval or CI) was 0.29 (0.16-0.53) 
for MDC and 4.17 (2.23-7.79) for BLC for the comparison of patients in the 4th 
quartile with the 1st quartile (both P<0.0001). When analysis was restricted to 
never smokers (196 patients/196 controls), MDC and BLC were still significantly 
associated with the risk of early stage lung adenocarcinoma (OR, 95% CI, P: 
0.37, 0.21-0.66, P<0.0001 for MDC and 2.78, 1.48-5.22, P =0.001 for BLC). 
Furthermore, elevated BLC was associated with a 2.90-fold (95% CI: 1.03-8.17, 
P=0.037) increased risk of subcentimeter lung adenocarcinoma, and there was an 
increasing trend for BLC with the progression of subcentimeter lung 
adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that MDC and BLC were independently 
associated with the significant risk of early stage lung adenocarcinoma, even in 
non-smokers and in stage IA patients. BLC was further identified to play a 
carcinogenic role in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma.
