In recent years, various large-scale proteomic studies have demonstrated that 
mitochondrial proteins are highly acylated, most commonly by addition of acetyl 
and succinyl groups. These acyl modifications may be enzyme catalysed but can 
also be driven non-enzymatically. The latter mechanism is promoted in 
mitochondria due to the nature of the mitochondrial microenvironment, which is 
alkaline and contains high concentrations of acyl-CoA species. Protein acylation 
may modify enzyme activity, typically inhibiting it. We posited that organismal 
ageing might be accompanied by an accumulation of acylated proteins, especially 
in mitochondria, and that this might compromise mitochondrial function and 
contribute to ageing. In this study, we used R. norvegicus, C. elegans and D. 
melanogaster to compare the acylation status of mitochondrial proteins between 
young and old animals. We observed a specific age-dependent increase in protein 
succinylation in worms and flies but not in rat. Rats have two 
substrate-specific mitochondrial deacylases, SIRT3 and SIRT5 while both flies 
and worms lack these enzymes. We propose that accumulation of mitochondrial 
protein acylation contributes to age-dependent mitochondrial functional decline 
and that SIRT3 and SIRT5 enzymes may promote longevity through regulation of 
mitochondrial protein acylation during ageing.
