OBJECTIVE: A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is associated with accelerated aortic 
valve disease (AVD) and abnormalities in aortic elasticity. We investigated the 
intima-media thickness of the descending aorta (AoIMT) in patients with AVD with 
or without an ascending aortic aneurysm (AscAA), in relation to BAV versus 
tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) phenotype, type of valve disease, cardiovascular 
risk factors, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a known 
association with carotid IMT.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 368 patients (210 with BAV, 158 with TAV,); mean age 
64 ± 13 years) were examined using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before 
valvular and/or aortic surgery. No patient had a coronary disease (CAD). The 
AoIMT was measured on short-axis TEE images of the descending aorta using a 
semi-automated edge-detection technique. AoIMT was univariately (P < 0.05) 
related to age, blood pressure, smoking, creatinine, highly sensitive C-reactive 
protein, HDL, valve hemodynamics and BAV. In the TAV subgroup it was also 
associated with the rs200991 SNP. Using multivariate regression analysis, age 
was the main determinant for AoIMT (P < 0.001), followed by male gender 
(P = 0.02), BAV was no longer a significant predictor of AoIMT. AoIMT was still 
related to the rs200991 SNP in TAV (P = 0.034), and to creatinine in BAV 
(P = 0.019), when other variables were accounted for.
CONCLUSIONS: Intima-media thickness of the descending aorta is not affected by 
aortic valve morphology (BAV/TAV); age is the main determinant of AoIMT. Genetic 
markers (SNPs) known to influence IMT in the carotid artery seem to correlate to 
IMT in the descending aorta only in patients with TAV.
