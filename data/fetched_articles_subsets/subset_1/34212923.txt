BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airways which accounts 
for a huge economic, morbidity and mortality burden. There are different 
cytokines that contribute to asthma pathophysiology. Learning about these 
cytokines leads to attaining novel anti-inflammatory treatments for asthma 
control.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate the association 
between interleukin-9 serum level and gene polymorphism with asthma 
susceptibility.
METHODS: This was a case-control study of 70 asthmatic patients and 77 healthy 
control adults aged 18-60. Asthma diagnosis and severity were based on physician 
diagnosis, pulmonary function test (PFT) and 2016 guild line of Global 
Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Interleukin 9(IL -9) serum level was measured 
using sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.Â  IL9 promoter single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2069882) was also assessed using Real-Time PCR 
System.
RESULTS: There was no significant association between IL-9 SNP polymorphism and 
asthma. IL-9 serum level was significantly associated with asthma susceptibility 
(p value= 0.016) and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) (P value=0.033) however its 
corelation with atopic asthma type, asthma sivierity and Immunoglubin E serum 
level were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: Although there was no association between IL-9 SNP and asthma, but 
IL-9 serum level was significantly correlated with asthma susceptibility and 
AEC.
