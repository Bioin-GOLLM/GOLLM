BACKGROUND: For cancer patients, red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a 
readily accessible and cost-effective preoperative prognostic predictor. This 
study aimed to determine whether RDW is a predictive factor for individuals 
undergoing radical surgery for gastric cancer (GC).
METHODS: A literature search was performed to select relevant studies for 
inclusion in the subsequent meta-analysis. Relevant data were pooled to assess 
the association between RDW and GC results, including overall survival (OS), 
disease-free survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS), as well as 
clinicopathological features.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis and systemic review included data from 8 studies 
comprising 1,587 individuals diagnosed with GC. In this context, RDW refers to 
the coefficient of variation of RDW (RDW-CV). A high level of RDW-CV was 
significantly associated with older age [odds ratio (OR) =2.25; 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 1.72-2.94; P<0.00001], larger tumor diameter (OR =1.90; 95% CI: 
1.42-2.56; P<0.0001), and vascular invasion (OR =2.22; 95% CI: 1.10-4.49; 
P=0.03). After hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were pooled, RDW-CV was found to 
be an independent prognostic factor of OS (HR =1.79; 95% CI: 1.21-2.66; I2=85%; 
P=0.004), DFS (HR =1.81; 95% CI: 1.37-2.39; I2=0%; P<0.0001), and CSS (HR =2.73; 
95% CI: 1.36-5.49; I2=0%; P=0.005) in patients with GC.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between high levels of RDW-CV and poor survival in 
GC suggests that RDW-CV may be a viable prognostic indicator for patients with 
GC.
