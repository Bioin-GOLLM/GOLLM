Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that directs 
cytoplasmic proteins, organelles and microbes to lysosomes for degradation. 
Autophagy acts at the intersection of pathways involved in cellular stress, host 
defense, and modulation of inflammatory and immune responses; however, the 
details of how the autophagy network intersects with these processes remain 
largely undefined. Given the role of autophagy in several human diseases, it is 
important to determine the extent to which modulators of autophagy also modify 
inflammatory or immune pathways and whether it is possible to modulate a subset 
of these pathways selectively. Here, we identify small-molecule inducers of 
basal autophagy (including several FDA-approved drugs) and characterize their 
effects on IL-1β production, autophagic engulfment and killing of intracellular 
bacteria, and development of Treg, TH17, and TH1 subsets from naïve T cells. 
Autophagy inducers with distinct, selective activity profiles were identified 
that reveal the functional architecture of connections between autophagy, and 
innate and adaptive immunity. In macrophages from mice bearing a conditional 
deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg16L1, the small molecules inhibit 
IL-1β production to varying degrees suggesting that individual compounds may 
possess both autophagy-dependent and autophagy-independent activity on immune 
pathways. The small molecule autophagy inducers constitute useful probes to test 
the contributions of autophagy-related pathways in diseases marked by impaired 
autophagy or elevated IL-1β and to test novel therapeutic hypotheses.
