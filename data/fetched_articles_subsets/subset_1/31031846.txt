Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the 
urinary system and the second-most common type of renal cell carcinoma. Aurora 
kinase A (AURKA), a serine/threonine kinase, has a critical role in centrosome 
duplication, spindle assembly checkpoint, and cytokinesis. Here, we determined 
the correlation between UCC susceptibility and AURKA polymorphisms. We used 
real-time polymerase chain reaction to compare the genotype distributions and 
allelic frequencies of four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of AURKA, 
namely rs1047972, rs2273535, rs2064863, and rs6024836, between 431 UCC cases and 
862 healthy controls. Logistic regression models demonstrated that the G allele 
of rs2064863, a genetic polymorphism of AURKA, exhibited a significant 
protective effect against UCC among the 862 nonsmokers. Moreover, patients with 
rs2064863 G allele exhibited a slightly lower risk of lymph node metastasis and 
those with rs6024836 G allele exhibited a lower risk of distant metastases. Our 
study suggested that several variants of AURKA SNPs rs2064863 and rs6024836 may 
serve as critical predictors for the clinical status of UCC.
