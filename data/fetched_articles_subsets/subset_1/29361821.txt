PURPOSE: Melanoma is a highly heterogeneous neoplasm, composed of subpopulations 
of tumor cells with distinct molecular and biological phenotypes and genotypes. 
In this study, to determine the genetic heterogeneity between primary and 
metastatic melanoma in Korean melanoma patients, we evaluated several well-known 
genetic alterations of melanoma. In addition, to elucidate the clinical 
relevance of each genetic alteration and heterogeneity between primary and 
metastatic lesions, clinical features and patient outcome were collected.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In addition to clinical data, BRAF, NRAS, GNAQ/11 
mutation and KIT amplification data was acquired from an archived primary Korean 
melanoma cohort (KMC) of 188 patients. Among these patients, 43 patients were 
included for investigation of tumor heterogeneity between primary melanoma and 
its corresponding metastatic lesions.
RESULTS: Overall incidence of genetic aberrations of the primary melanomas in 
KMC was 17.6% of BRAF V600, 12.6% of NRAS mutation, and 28.6% of KIT 
amplification. GNAQ/11 mutation was seen in 66.6% of the uveal melanoma 
patients. Patients with BRAF mutation were associated with advanced stage and 
correlated to poor prognosis (p < 0.01). Among 43 patients, 55.8% showed 
heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesion. The frequency of BRAF 
mutation and KIT amplification significantly increased in the metastatic lesions 
compared to primary melanomas. <GNAQ/11 mutation showed 100% homogeneity in 
uveal melanoma patients.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated heterogeneity between primary melanomas and 
corresponding metastatic lesions for BRAF, NRAS mutation and KIT amplification. 
However, GNAQ/11 mutation was genetically homogeneous between primary and 
metastatic melanoma lesions in uveal melanoma.
