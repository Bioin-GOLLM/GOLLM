Members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors 
play important roles in a wide range of developmental processes. In this study, 
we conducted a genome-wide survey using the chicken (Gallus gallus) genomic 
database, and identified 104 bHLH sequences belonging to 42 gene families in an 
effort to characterize the chicken bHLH transcription factor family. 
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that chicken has 50, 21, 15, 4, 8, and 3 bHLH 
members in groups A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively, while three members 
belonging to none of these groups were classified as ''orphans". A comparison 
between chicken and human bHLH repertoires suggested that both organisms have a 
number of lineage-specific bHLH members in the proteomes. Chromosome 
distribution patterns and phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest that the bHLH 
members should have arisen through gene duplication at an early date. Gene 
Ontology (GO) enrichment statistics showed 51 top GO annotations of biological 
processes counted in the frequency. The present study deepens our understanding 
of the chicken bHLH transcription factor family and provides much useful 
information for further studies using chicken as a model system.
