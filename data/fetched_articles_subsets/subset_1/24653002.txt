Platynereis dumerilii is a marine polychaete and an established model system for 
studies of evolution and development. Platynereis is also a re-emerging model 
for studying the molecular basis of circalunar reproductive timing: a biological 
phenomenon observed in many marine species. While gene expression studies have 
provided new insight into patterns of gene regulation, a lack of reverse genetic 
tools has so far limited the depth of functional analyses in this species. To 
address this need, we established customized transcriptional activator-like 
effector nucleases (TALENs) as a tool to engineer targeted modifications in 
Platynereis genes. By adapting a workflow of TALEN construction protocols and 
mutation screening approaches for use in Platynereis, we engineered frameshift 
mutations in three endogenous Platynereis genes. We confirmed that such 
mutations are heritable, demonstrating that TALENs can be used to generate 
homozygous knockout lines in P. dumerilii. This is the first use of TALENs for 
generating genetic knockout mutations in an annelid model. These tools not only 
open the door for detailed in vivo functional analyses, but also can facilitate 
further technical development, such as targeted genome editing.
