BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mounting evidence implicates the Hippo downstream effectors 
Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding 
motif (TAZ) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the functional 
contribution of YAP and/or TAZ to c-MYC-induced liver tumor development.
METHODS: The requirement for YAP and/or TAZ in c-Myc-driven hepatocarcinogenesis 
was analyzed using conditional Yap, Taz, and Yap;Taz knockout (KO) mice. An 
hepatocyte-specific inducible TTR-CreERT2 KO system was applied to evaluate the 
role of YAP and TAZ during tumor progression. Expression patterns of YAP, TAZ, 
c-MYC, and BCL2L12 were analyzed in human HCC samples.
RESULTS: We found that the Hippo cascade is inactivated in c-Myc-induced mouse 
HCC. Intriguingly, TAZ mRNA levels and activation status correlated with c-MYC 
activity in human and mouse HCC, but YAP mRNA levels did not. We demonstrated 
that TAZ is a direct transcriptional target of c-MYC. In c-Myc induced murine 
HCCs, ablation of Taz, but not Yap, completely prevented tumor development. 
Mechanistically, TAZ was required to avoid c-Myc-induced hepatocyte apoptosis 
during tumor initiation. The anti-apoptotic BCL2L12 gene was identified as a 
novel target regulated specifically by YAP/TAZ, whose silencing strongly 
suppressed c-Myc-driven murine hepatocarcinogenesis. In c-Myc murine HCC 
lesions, conditional knockout of Taz, but not Yap, led to tumor regression, 
supporting the requirement of TAZ for c-Myc-driven HCC progression.
CONCLUSIONS: TAZ is a pivotal player at the crossroad between the c-MYC and 
Hippo pathways in HCC. Targeting TAZ might be beneficial for the treatment of 
patients with HCC and c-MYC activation.
LAY SUMMARY: The identification of novel treatment targets and approaches for 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is crucial to improve survival outcomes. 
We identified TAZ as a transcriptional target of c-MYC which plays a critical 
role in c-MYC-dependent hepatocarcinogenesis. TAZ could potentially be targeted 
for the treatment of patients with c-MYC-driven hepatocellular carcinoma.
