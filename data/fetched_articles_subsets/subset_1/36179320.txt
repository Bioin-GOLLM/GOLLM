SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent behind the COVID-19 pandemic. The main 
protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key enzyme that processes 
polyproteins translated from the viral RNA. Mpro is therefore an attractive 
target for the design of inhibitors that block viral replication. We report the 
diastereomeric resolution of the previously designed SARS-CoV-2 Mpro α-ketoamide 
inhibitor 13b. The pure (S,S,S)-diastereomer, 13b-K, displays an IC50 of 120 nM 
against the Mpro and EC50 values of 0.8-3.4 μM for antiviral activity in 
different cell types. Crystal structures have been elucidated for the Mpro 
complexes with each of the major diastereomers, the active (S,S,S)-13b (13b-K), 
and the nearly inactive (R,S,S)-13b (13b-H); results for the latter reveal a 
novel binding mode. Pharmacokinetic studies show good levels of 13b-K after 
inhalative as well as after peroral administration. The active inhibitor (13b-K) 
is a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral treatment for 
COVID-19.
