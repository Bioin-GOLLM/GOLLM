C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the -174 GC IL-6 gene 
polymorphism were analyzed after coronary angioplasty in 50 patients, 25 of whom 
were treated with the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet receptor inhibitor 
eptifibatide for 24 hours. It was found that glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition 
significantly blocked postangioplasty CRP increases in all patients but blocked 
IL-6 increases only in patients carrying the -174 GG genotype.
