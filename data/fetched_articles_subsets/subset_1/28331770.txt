PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ogimi village is renowned for its aging population. We sought 
to determine if the l-serine content of their diet could account for their 
neurological health.
RECENT FINDINGS: The most frequently consumed food items, including tofu and 
seaweeds, are rich in the dietary amino acid l-serine. l-serine content of the 
Ogimi diet >8 grams/day for Ogimi women significantly exceeds the average 
American dietary intake of 2.5 grams/day for women >70 years old.
SUMMARY: Our hypothesis that the high l-serine content of the Ogimi diet is 
related to the paucity of tangle diseases among villagers is buttressed by in 
vivo results with non-human primates where dietary l-serine slowed development 
of neurofibrillary tangles and β-amyloid plaques by up to 85% and a human 
clinical trial finding that l-serine at 15 grams/day twice daily slows 
functional decline in ALS patients. Analysis of the Ogimi diet suggests that 
l-serine should be evaluated for therapeutic potential as a neuroprotective 
agent.
