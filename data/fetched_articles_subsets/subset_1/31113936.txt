XPO1 (exportin1) mediates nuclear export of proteins and RNAs and is frequently 
overexpressed in cancers. In this study, we show that the orally bioavailable 
XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 reduced Mcl-1 protein level, by which it synergized with 
Bcl-xL inhibitor A-1331852 to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. 
KPT-330/A-1331852 combination disrupted bindings of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL to Bax, 
Bak, and/or Bim, elicited mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and 
triggered apoptosis. KPT-330 generally mitigated mRNA expression and protein 
synthesis rather than mRNA nuclear export or protein stability of Mcl-1. KPT-330 
inhibited mTORC1/4E-BP1 and Mnk1/eIF4E axes, which disrupted the eIF4F 
translation initiation complex but was dispensable for Mcl-1 reduction and 
KPT-330/A-1331852 combination-induced apoptosis. Mature rRNAs are integral 
components of the ribosome that determines protein synthesis ability. KPT-330 
impeded nucleolar rRNA processing and reduced total levels of multiple mature 
rRNAs. Reconstitution of XPO1 by expressing degradation-resistant C528S mutant 
retained rRNA amount, Mcl-1 expression, and Bcl-xL inhibitor resistance upon 
KPT-330 treatment. KPT-330/A-1331852 combination suppressed growth and enhanced 
apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer xenografts. Therefore, we clarify the 
reason of apoptosis resistance of cancer cells to XPO1 inhibition and develop a 
potential strategy for treating solid tumors.
