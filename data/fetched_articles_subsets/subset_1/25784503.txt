Polymorphisms rs6232 and rs6234/rs6235 in PCSK1 have been associated with 
extreme obesity [e.g. body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m(2)], but their 
contribution to common obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and BMI variation in a 
multi-ethnic context is unclear. To fill this gap, we collected phenotypic and 
genetic data in up to 331 175 individuals from diverse ethnic groups. This 
process involved a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Web of 
Science, Embase and the NIH GWAS catalog complemented by data extraction from 
pre-existing GWAS or custom-arrays in consortia and single studies. We employed 
recently developed global meta-analytic random-effects methods to calculate 
summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or beta estimates 
and standard errors (SE) for the obesity status and BMI analyses, respectively. 
Significant associations were found with binary obesity status for rs6232 (OR = 
1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.24, P = 6.08 × 10(-6)) and rs6234/rs6235 (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 
1.04-1.10, P = 3.00 × 10(-7)). Similarly, significant associations were found 
with continuous BMI for rs6232 (β = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.07; P = 0.047) and 
rs6234/rs6235 (β = 0.02, 95% CI 0.00-0.03; P = 5.57 × 10(-4)). Ethnicity, age 
and study ascertainment significantly modulated the association of PCSK1 
polymorphisms with obesity. In summary, we demonstrate evidence that common gene 
variation in PCSK1 contributes to BMI variation and susceptibility to common 
obesity in the largest known meta-analysis published to date in genetic 
epidemiology.
