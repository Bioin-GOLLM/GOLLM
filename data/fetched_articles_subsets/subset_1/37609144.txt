People with HIV (PWH) experience an increased vulnerability to premature aging 
and inflammation-associated comorbidities, even when HIV replication is 
suppressed by antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the factors that contribute 
to or are associated with this vulnerability remain uncertain. In the general 
population, alterations in the glycomes of circulating IgGs trigger inflammation 
and precede the onset of aging-associated diseases. Here, we investigate the IgG 
glycomes of cross-sectional and longitudinal samples from 1,216 women and men, 
both living with virally suppressed HIV and those without HIV. Our glycan-based 
machine learning models indicate that living with chronic HIV significantly 
accelerates the accumulation of pro-aging-associated glycomic alterations. 
Consistently, PWH exhibit heightened expression of senescence-associated 
glycan-degrading enzymes compared to their controls. These glycomic alterations 
correlate with elevated markers of inflammatory aging and the severity of 
comorbidities, potentially preceding the development of such comorbidities. 
Mechanistically, HIV-specific antibodies glycoengineered with these alterations 
exhibit reduced anti-HIV IgG-mediated innate immune functions. These findings 
hold significant potential for the development of glycomic-based biomarkers and 
tools to identify and prevent premature aging and comorbidities in people living 
with chronic viral infections.
