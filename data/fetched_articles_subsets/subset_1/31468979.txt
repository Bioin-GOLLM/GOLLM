Gait speed declines at a faster rate in persons with HIV (PWH) than in the 
general population but the risk factors associated with this decline are not 
well understood. In the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) A5322 (HAILO, HIV 
Infection, Aging, and Immune Function Long-term Observational Study), an 
observational cohort study of PWH ≥40 years of age, those who developed slow 
gait during the first 3 years of follow-up were compared with persons who 
maintained normal speed. Associations with demographic and clinical covariates 
were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Of 929 participants, 81% 
were men, 31% Black, and 20% Hispanic. Median age was 51 years [interquartile 
range (IQR) = 46-56]. At study entry, 92% had plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL with 
median CD4 count 631 cells/mm3 (IQR = 458-840). At study entry, 7% of 
participants had slow gait, 16% had neurocognitive impairment (NCI), and 12% had 
diabetes. Over 3 years, 87% maintained normal gait speed, 3% maintained a slow 
gait, 6% developed a slow gait, and 4% improved from slow to normal gait speed. 
In multivariable models, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) percentage, per one unit 
increase [odds ratio (OR) = 1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.81; 
p = .033], NCI (OR = 3.47; 95% CI = 1.57-7.69 p = .002), and black versus white 
race (OR = 2.45; 95% CI = 1.08-5.59; p = .032) at entry were significantly 
associated with development of slow gait compared with those maintaining normal 
gait speed. The association between baseline HbA1C and development of slow gait 
speed highlights an intervenable target to prevent progression of physical 
function limitations.
