AIM: Previous studies suggest that klotho gene polymorphisms may be associated 
with atherosclerosis, but did not assess the relationship between klotho gene 
polymorphisms and atherosclerosis parameters such as carotid artery intima-media 
thickness (IMT). Here, we studied whether klotho single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNP) were associated with carotid atherosclerosis.
METHODS: All subjects were Japanese. Eight-hundred and fifty-three patients with 
hypertension (465 men and 388 women) in the outpatient clinic and 1783 subjects 
from the general population (821 men and 962 women) attending health check-ups 
were analyzed in the present study. We measured mean IMT of the common carotid 
artery to evaluate carotid atherosclerosis. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNP) (rs7323281; intron1, rs5644481; exon4, rs3752472; exon3, rs650439; 
intron4) of klotho were selected as representative SNP in haplotype blocks.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted by confounding 
factors showed a significant association of rs650439 with carotid 
atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients (TT vs TA vs AA, P < 0.01; TT + TA vs 
AA, P < 0.01). By ancova considering confounding factors, rs650439 was also 
significantly associated with mean IMT (TT + TA vs AA, P = 0.04) in the 
hypertensive population. However, there was no significant association between 
klotho SNP and carotid IMT in the general population. Compared to the general 
population, the subject group with hypertensive patients clearly had more 
atherosclerosis risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Only in hypertensive patients was klotho rs650439 strongly 
associated with mean IMT thickening of the common carotid artery. Therefore, 
klotho SNP (rs650439) may influence on the progression of carotid 
atherosclerosis in patients with hypertension.
