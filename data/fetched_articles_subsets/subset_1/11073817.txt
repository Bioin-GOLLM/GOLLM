The proto-oncogene KIT encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. 
Gain-of-function mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of KIT have been reported 
in human gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In a family with multiple 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors and diffuse hyperplasia of myenteric plexus 
layer, we have identified another mutation of KIT, a single base mutation, 
resulting in the substitution of Glu for Lys(642) in the kinase I domain, and 
studied its biological effect in a cellular system. The mouse homologue of the 
human KIT mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and stably 
transfected into the interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 murine cell line. The 
oncogenic potential of the mutated KIT was assessed in vitro by a proliferation 
assay and in vivo by transplantation into nude mice. Transfected Ba/F3 cells 
grew autonomously in absence of growth factors and formed tumors in nude mice. 
Substitution of Glu for Lys(642) is an oncogenic mutation in the tyrosine kinase 
domain of KIT. As germline heterozygous mutation, it causes a diffuse 
hyperplasia of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal during embryonic 
development and occurrence of multiple gastrointestinal stromal tumors at 
adulthood.
