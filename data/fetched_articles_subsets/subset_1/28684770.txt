This study is to investigate the frequencies of T-helper (Th)22, Th17 and Th1 
cells and the levels of related cytokines in subchondral bone marrow in patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples were 
collected from RA, osteoarthritis (OA) patients and healthy controls. The 
frequencies of Th22, Th17, and Th1 cells were examined by flow cytometry. Levels 
of interleukin (IL)-22, IL-17 and IFN-Î³ were examined by ELISA. Disease Activity 
Score in 28 joints (DAS28) of RA patients were analyzed. Bone marrow Th22, Th17 
and Th1 cells in RA patients were markedly increased comparing to OA or healthy 
controls. Each T cell subset in bone marrow was elevated comparing with that in 
the peripheral blood in RA patients. Consistently, plasma levels of IL-22 and 
IL-17 were elevated in RA patients, and the elevation was more notable in the 
bone marrow than in the peripheral blood. Additionally, the percentages of Th22, 
Th17 and Th1 cells as well as the levels of IL-22 and IL-17 in bone marrow were 
positively correlated with DAS28. These results suggest that local 
pro-inflammatory Th cells are elevated in bone marrow, which may play an 
important role in situ in RA and contribute to the pathogenesis of in RA.
