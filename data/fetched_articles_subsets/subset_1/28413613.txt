The zebrafish ( Danio rerio) is a powerful vertebrate model to study cellular 
and developmental processes in vivo. The optical clarity and their amenability 
to genetic manipulation make zebrafish a model of choice when it comes to 
applying optical techniques involving genetically encoded photoresponsive 
protein technologies. In recent years, a number of fluorescent protein and 
optogenetic technologies have emerged that allow new ways to visualize, 
quantify, and perturb developmental dynamics. Here, we explain the principles of 
these new tools and describe some of their representative applications in 
zebrafish.
