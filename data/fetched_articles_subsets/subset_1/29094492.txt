INTRODUCTION: Mast cells play an important role in allergic responses.
METHODS: We herein demonstrated the mechanisms of inhibitory effect of adenine 
on IgE/antigen-induced degranulation and TNF-α release in mast cells.
RESULTS: We found that these effects were dependent on the amino group of 
adenine because purine only weakly inhibited degranulation. Adenine also 
inhibited Ca2+ ionophore- and thapsigargin-induced degranulation, however, this 
inhibitory effect was weaker than that of the antigen. Therefore, the inhibitory 
effects of adenine on degranulation may be mediated before as well as after the 
Ca2+ raise under the antigen stimulus. Adenine inhibited antigen-induced Syk and 
the subsequent induction of AKT and ERK activation under FcϵRI-mediated signal. 
Adenine also attenuated antigen-induced increase in Ca2+ . Furthermore, adenine 
inhibited IgE/antigen-induced IKKα/β activation, which is involved in 
degranulation. Finally, adenine protected mice against anaphylactic allergic 
responses in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed a key role of adenine in the attenuation 
of allergic responses through the inhibition of Syk-mediated signal transduction 
and IKK-mediated degranulation.
