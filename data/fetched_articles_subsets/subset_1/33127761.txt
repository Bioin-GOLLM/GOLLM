Inhibition of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in combination with blockade of the 
PD-1/PD-L1 T cell checkpoint induces T cell infiltration and anticancer 
responses in murine and human pancreatic cancer. Here we elucidate the mechanism 
by which CXCR4 inhibition affects the tumor immune microenvironment. In human 
immune cell-based chemotaxis assays, we find that CXCL12-stimulated CXCR4 
inhibits the directed migration mediated by CXCR1, CXCR3, CXCR5, CXCR6, and 
CCR2, respectively, chemokine receptors expressed by all of the immune cell 
types that participate in an integrated immune response. Inhibiting CXCR4 in an 
experimental cancer medicine study by 1-wk continuous infusion of the 
small-molecule inhibitor AMD3100 (plerixafor) induces an integrated immune 
response that is detected by transcriptional analysis of paired biopsies of 
metastases from patients with microsatellite stable colorectal and pancreatic 
cancer. This integrated immune response occurs in three other examples of 
immune-mediated damage to noninfected tissues: Rejecting renal allografts, 
melanomas clinically responding to anti-PD1 antibody therapy, and microsatellite 
instable colorectal cancers. Thus, signaling by CXCR4 causes immune suppression 
in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer by impairing the 
function of the chemokine receptors that mediate the intratumoral accumulation 
of immune cells.
