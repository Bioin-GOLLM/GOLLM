BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis predicts liver-related morbidity and mortality in 
patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Non-invasive scores 
correlate with the degree of liver fibrosis in these patients.
AIMS AND METHODS: To investigate the accuracy of noninvasive scoring systems in 
predicting long-term outcomes and cancer incidence of patients with NAFLD, we 
performed a single-center retrospective study of patients with biopsy proven 
NAFLD. Mean follow up period was 100 months. Outcomes included liver-related 
complications, hospitalizations, overall mortality and the development of any 
malignancies.
RESULTS: 32 patients had advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) per biopsy at baseline and 
121 patients had mild to moderate fibrosis (F0-F2). Both advanced histologic 
fibrosis stage as well as higher non-invasive scores predicted repeated 
hospitalizations and longer hospitalization stays. In a multivariate analysis, 
liver fibrosis (p = 0.002), FIB-4 score (p<0.001), NFS (p<0.001) but not APRI 
score (p = 0.07) were predictors of overall mortality, and the occurrence of 
malignancies was associated with higher APRI (p<0.001), FIB-4 (p<0.001) and NFS 
(p = 0.008) scores, but not with advanced fibrosis, as determined by liver 
biopsy (p = 0.105).
CONCLUSIONS: In NAFLD patients, noninvasive scoring systems are good predictors 
of morbidity and mortality and may have an additive value in predicting the 
development of hepatic and extra-hepatic cancers.
