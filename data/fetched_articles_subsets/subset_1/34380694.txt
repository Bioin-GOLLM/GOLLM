Stem cell-derived β-like cells (sBC) carry the promise of providing an abundant 
source of insulin-producing cells for use in cell replacement therapy for 
patients with diabetes, potentially allowing widespread implementation of a 
practical cure. To achieve their clinical promise, sBC need to function 
comparably with mature adult β-cells, but as yet they display varying degrees of 
maturity. Indeed, detailed knowledge of the events resulting in human β-cell 
maturation remains obscure. Here we show that sBC spontaneously self-enrich into 
discreet islet-like cap structures within in vitro cultures, independent of 
exogenous maturation conditions. Multiple complementary assays demonstrate that 
this process is accompanied by functional maturation of the self-enriched sBC 
(seBC); however, the seBC still contain distinct subpopulations displaying 
different maturation levels. Interestingly, the surface protein ENTPD3 (also 
known as nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-3 [NDPTase3]) is a specific 
marker of the most mature seBC population and can be used for mature seBC 
identification and sorting. Our results illuminate critical aspects of in vitro 
sBC maturation and provide important insights toward developing functionally 
mature sBC for diabetes cell replacement therapy.
