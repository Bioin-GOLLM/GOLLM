INTRODUCTION: Thrombosis is the most common complication in Philadelphia 
chromosome negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort of 258 Ph- myeloproliferative neoplasm 
patients, the difference between patients with and without thrombosis was 
analyzed according to genetic thrombophilia factors, JAK2 V617F status and 
burden allele, blood count, cardiovascular risk factors and age. Patients were 
also divided in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 
primary myelofibrosis (PMF) subgroups as well as by the type of thrombosis.
RESULTS: Analysis of cardiovascular risk factors regarding arterial thrombosis 
showed that PV patients with thrombosis had higher incidence of diabetes (P = 
.030), ET patients more often had hypertension (P = .003) and hyperlipidemia 
(P = .005), while PMF patients had hyperlipidemia (P = .046) and at least one 
cardiovascular risk factor (P = .044). Moreover, leukocytes > 18 × 109/L and 
V617F burden allele > 25.7% were statistically significantly different in PV 
patients (P = .019 and borderline significant at P = .055, respectively), while 
in ET patients leukocytes > 9.2 × 109/L (P < .001) and age at diagnosis of > 55 
years were statistically significantly different (P = .002). PMF patients with 
V617F burden allele ≤ 34.8% were more prone to thrombosis (P = .032). When 
comparing patients with and without venous thrombosis, cutoff value of V617F 
burden allele > 90.4% was significant for PV patients with thrombosis 
(P = .036), as was > 56.7% for PMF patients with thrombosis (P = .046). 
Platelets ≤ 536 × 109/L and age at diagnosis > 54 years showed statistically 
significant difference for ET patients with thrombosis (P = .015 and P = .041, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: On the basis of our results, a new scoring system for thrombosis 
risk in PV could be made, while PMF prognostic model may be expanded for better 
recognition of potential thrombotic risk factors.
