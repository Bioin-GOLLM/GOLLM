OBJECTIVE: Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental disorders and its 
etiology is supposed to be an interaction between genes and environmental 
factors. Previous genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia have reported 
multiple susceptibility loci including rs6704641 in the SATB2 gene. Recently, 
this locus was further confirmed as a genome-wide significant locus for 
association with schizophrenia by trans-ancestry meta-analysis of Han Chinese 
and Caucasian samples. However, there is no report of genetic analysis in Uygur 
Chinese population, which is considered to have a combined genetic background 
between eastern Asia and Caucasian. This study is aimed to explore whether SATB2 
gene is significantly associated with schizophrenia in Uygur Chinese population, 
thus providing additional evidence for elucidating the role of SATB2 gene in 
schizophrenia.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In this study, we performed a case-control analysis 
focusing on seven tag single nucleotide polymorphisms located in SATB2 gene 
among 985 patients with schizophrenia and 1218 healthy controls recruited from 
the Xinjiang Province of China.
RESULTS: We found that rs6704641 was significantly associated with schizophrenia 
in both allelic and genotypic distributions (Pallele = 0.008, Pgenotype = 0.028 
after correction). In addition, rs16831466 is significantly associated with 
schizophrenia in allelic distributions (corrected Pallele = 0.041). Besides, 
several haplotypes of single nucleotide polymorphism are significantly 
associated with schizophrenia too.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that SATB2 is also a susceptibility gene for 
schizophrenia in Uygur Chinese population, and subsequent functional experiments 
are necessary to reveal its role in the pathogenesis.
