Human immune system (HIS) mice provide a valuable platform to investigate and 
modulate human hematopoiesis development in vivo. Here, we describe detailed 
protocols for the construction of HIS mice, modulation of human hematopoiesis in 
vivo using hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding cytokines of interest, 
and flow cytometry analysis of humanization levels and human immune subsets. 
This approach can be easily applied to screen or verify factors that regulate 
human hematopoiesis and immune system. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Cardoso et al. (2021) and Li et al. 
(2017).
