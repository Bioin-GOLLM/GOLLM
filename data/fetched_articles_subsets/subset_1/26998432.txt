Malaria is a major public health burden throughout the world. Resistance to the 
antimalarial drugs has increased the mortality and morbidity rate that is 
achieved so far through the malaria control program. Monitoring the drug 
resistance to the available antimalarial drugs helps to implement effective drug 
policy, through the in vivo efficacy studies, in vitro drug susceptibility tests 
and detection of molecular markers. It is important to understand the mechanism 
of the antimalarial drugs, as it is one of the key factors in the emergence and 
spread of drug resistance. This review summarizes the commonly used antimalarial 
drugs, their mechanism of action and the genetic markers validated so far for 
the detection of drug-resistant parasites.
