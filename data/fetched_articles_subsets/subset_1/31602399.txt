As an alternative target to surgically resected tissue specimens, liquid biopsy 
has gained much attention over the past decade. Of the various circulating 
biomarkers, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have particularly opened new windows 
into the metastatic cascade, with their functional, biochemical, and biophysical 
properties. Given the extreme rarity of intact CTCs and the associated technical 
challenges, however, analyses have been limited to bulk-cell strategies, missing 
out on clinically significant sources of information from cellular 
heterogeneity. With recent technological developments, it is now possible to 
probe genetic material of CTCs at the single-cell resolution to study spatial 
and temporal dynamics in circulation. Here, we discuss recent transcriptomic 
profiling efforts that enabled single-cell characterization of patient-derived 
CTCs spanning diverse cancer types. We further highlight how expression data of 
these putative biomarkers have advanced our understanding of metastatic spectrum 
and provided a basis for the development of CTC-based liquid biopsies to track, 
monitor, and predict the efficacy of therapy and any emergent resistance.
