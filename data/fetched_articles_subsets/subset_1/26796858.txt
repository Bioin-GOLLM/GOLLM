BACKGROUND: Filaggrin (FLG), which is formed from profilaggrin protein during 
epidermal terminal differentiation, is a prerequisite to squame biogenesis and 
thus for perfect formation of the skin barrier. Yet, the relationship between 
genetic polymorphisms of FLG and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) has not been 
investigated.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 93 CIU patients and 93 healthy 
control subjects without a history of allergic, autoimmune or any other systemic 
disease. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FLG were investigated: 
rs2485518, rs3126065, rs2786680, rs3814300, and rs3814299.
RESULTS: For all the investigated polymorphisms, 100% of both CIU patients and 
control subjects exhibited one given allele and consequently one given genotype 
as following: A/A genotype for two SNPs, rs3126065 and rs2786680, C/C genotype 
for two SNPs, rs2485518 and rs3814300, and G/G genotype for one SNP rs3814299 of 
FLG, and hence no association was found between either allele frequencies or 
genotype distributions of FLG SNPs and CIU in an Iranian population.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study examined the possible relationship between SNPs 
of FLG and CIU for the first time, and demonstrated that none of five 
investigated SNPs (rs2485518, rs3126065, rs2786680, rs3814300, and rs3814299) 
are correlated with CIU in an Iranian population. Further investigations are 
required to address whether ethnicity/race impacts on relationship between SNPs 
of FLG and CIU.
