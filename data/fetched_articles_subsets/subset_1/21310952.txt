Protein phosphatase M (PPM) regulates key signaling pathways in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes. Novel structures of bacterial PPM members revealed three divalent 
metal ions in their catalytic centers. The function of metal 3 (M3) remained 
unclear. To reveal its function, we created variants of tPphA from 
Thermosynechococcus elongatus in all metal-coordinating residues, and multiple 
variants were created for the M3 coordinating Asp-119 residue. The structures of 
variants D119A and D193A were resolved, showing loss of M3 binding but 
unaffected binding of M1 and M2 in the catalytic center of D119A, with the 
nucleophilic water molecule in the correct place. The catalytic activity of this 
variant was highly impaired. This and further structure-function analyses showed 
that M3 is required for catalysis by providing a water molecule as a proton 
donor during catalysis. Mutation of the homologue Asp residue in human PP2Cα 
also caused loss of function, suggesting a general requirement of M3 in 
PPM-catalyzed reactions.
