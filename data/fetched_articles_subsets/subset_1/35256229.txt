BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soluble adhesion molecules are associated with 
cardiovascular disease and increased in individuals with diabetes. This study 
assesses the impact of diabetes exposure in utero on the abundance of 
circulating adhesion molecules in cord serum and soluble adhesion molecules 
released from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to high 
glucose concentrations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Women with and without diabetes were recruited. DM was 
diagnosed based on the American Diabetes Association criteria. Primary cultures 
of HUVEC were cultured in 5 mM and 25 mM glucose with 25 mM mannitol osmotic 
control. The soluble adhesion molecules, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), 
vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and E-selectin were measured by ELISA in 
the cord blood serum and conditioned HUVEC media. The mothers with DM were older 
with higher BMI (p = 0.027 and 0.008, respectively). In a fully adjusted model, 
VCAM was significantly increased in the cord serum of infants born to mothers 
with diabetes (p = 0.046), but ICAM and E-selectin were not different. ICAM was 
also significantly correlated with maternal HbA1c (r2 = 0.16, p = 0.004) and 
cord serum non-esterified fatty acids (r2 = 0.08, p = 0.013). From the HUVEC 
media, the abundance of adhesion molecules was not different based on DM or high 
glucose exposure; however, VCAM abundance in the HUVEC supernatant was 
significantly correlated with ICAM (r2 = 0.27, p = 0.010) and cord serum 
c-peptide (R2 = 0.19, p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in soluble adhesion molecule abundance in infants 
exposed to the diabetic milieu of pregnancy may reflect early alterations in 
vascular function predicting future cardiovascular disease.
