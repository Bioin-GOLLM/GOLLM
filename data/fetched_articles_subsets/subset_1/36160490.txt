We report a case of Fabry disease diagnosed after recurrent cerebral infarction 
in a patient with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). A 23-year-old man 
presented with vision loss in his right eye (20/2000), showing CRAO. There was 
no identified cause for the loss of vision; however, corneal verticillata was 
detected in both eyes on the recurrence of the cerebral infarction. The 
α-galactosidase activity in leukocytes was significantly reduced to <0.3 nmol/mg 
of protein/hour, leading to a definitive diagnosis of Fabry disease. Enzyme 
replacement therapy was commenced concomitant to rehabilitation. It is necessary 
to identify Fabry disease as a cause of CRAO in young individuals, and the 
detection of cornea verticillata, used frequently as an ocular finding, is 
helpful.
