Metastatic tumour recurrence due to failed treatments remains a major challenge 
of breast cancer clinical management. Here we report that interleukin-1 
receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is overexpressed in a subset of breast 
cancers, in particular triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it acts to 
drive aggressive growth, metastasis and acquired resistance to paclitaxel 
treatment. We show that IRAK1 overexpression confers TNBC growth advantage 
through NF-ÎºB-related cytokine secretion and metastatic TNBC cells exhibit gain 
of IRAK1 dependency, resulting in high susceptibility to genetic and 
pharmacologic inhibition of IRAK1. Importantly, paclitaxel treatment induces 
strong IRAK1 phosphorylation, an increase in inflammatory cytokine expression, 
enrichment of cancer stem cells and acquired resistance to paclitaxel treatment. 
Pharmacologic inhibition of IRAK1 is able to reverse paclitaxel resistance by 
triggering massive apoptosis at least in part through inhibiting p38-MCL1 
pro-survival pathway. Our study thus demonstrates IRAK1 as a promising 
therapeutic target for TNBC metastasis and paclitaxel resistance.
