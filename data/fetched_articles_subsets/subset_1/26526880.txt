AIM: To study the effects of d- and l-limonene on pregnant rat myometrial 
contractility in vitro, and investigate how these effects are modified by other 
agents. D- and l-limonene (10(-13)-10(-8) M) caused myometrial contraction in a 
dose-dependent manner.
METHODS: Contractions of uterine rings from 22-day-pregnant rats were measured 
in an organ bath in the presence of d- or l-limonene (10(-13)-10(-8) M) and 
nifedipine (10(-8) M), tetraethyl-ammonium (10(-3) M), theophylline (10(-5) M), 
or paxilline (10(-5) M). Uterine cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level was 
detected by enzyme immunoassay. Oxidative damage was induced by methylglyoxal 
(3×10(-2) M) and the alteration was measured via noradrenaline (1×10(-9) to 
3×10(-5) M) -induced contractions.
RESULTS: Pre-treatment with nifedipine (10(-8) M), tetraethylammonium (10(-3) 
M), and theophylline (10(-5) M) attenuated the contracting effect of d- and 
l-limonene, while in the presence of paxilline (10(-5) M) d- and l-limonene were 
ineffective. The two enantiomers decreased the myometrial cAMP level, but after 
paxilline pretreatment the cAMP level was not altered compared with the control 
value. Additionally, l-limonene (10(-6) M) diminished consequences of oxidative 
damage caused by methylglyoxal (3×10(-2) M) on contractility, whereas d-limonene 
was ineffective.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that l-limonene has an antioxidant effect and 
that both d-and l-limonene cause myometrial contraction through activation of 
the A2A receptor and opening of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel. It is possible 
that limonene-containing products increase the pregnant uterus contractility and 
their use should be avoided during pregnancy.
