Listeria innocua DNA binding protein from starved cells (LiDps) belongs to the 
ferritin family and provides a promising self-assembling spherical 12-mer 
protein scaffold for the generation of functional nanomaterials. We report the 
creation of a Gaussia princeps luciferase (Gluc)-LiDps fusion protein, with 
chemical conjugation of Zinc (II)-protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) to lysine residues on 
the fusion protein (giving Gluc-LiDps-ZnPP). The Gluc-LiDps-ZnPP conjugate is 
shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via Bioluminescence Resonance 
Energy Transfer (BRET) between the Gluc (470-490 nm) and ZnPP. In vitro, 
Gluc-LiDps-ZnPP is efficiently taken up by tumorigenic cells (SKBR3 and 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells). In the presence of coelenterazine, this 
construct inhibits the proliferation of SKBR3 due to elevated ROS levels. 
Following exposure to Gluc-LiDps-ZnPP, migration of surviving SKBR3 cells is 
significantly suppressed. These results demonstrate the potential of the 
Gluc-LiDps-ZnPP conjugate as a platform for future development of an anticancer 
photodynamic therapy agent.
