AIM: Over-expression of some genes, such as MDR1, can increase the level of 
chemotherapy drug afflux and limit the effectiveness of treatment. We aimed to 
investigate the effect of MDR1 polymorphisms on its expression level and related 
characteristics in Iranian colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: Tumor, normal mucosal tissue and blood samples from CRC patients and 
blood samples from healthy controls (n=60) were obtained for genotyping and 
measuring the expression level of MDR1.
RESULTS: The expression of the MDR1 gene showed a significant increase in 
cancerous regions compared to adjacent normal tissue. Furthermore, the GG2677 
genotype was correlated with highest while the AT 2677 genotype was associated 
with the lowest levels of expression. In addition only the G2677T/A polymorphism 
showed association with histological grade of colorectal tumors.
CONCLUSION: Our study once more emphasizes effects of MDR1 SNPs which may 
indirectly impact on response to drugs.
