Human rotaviruses attach to histo-blood group antigens glycans and null alleles 
of the ABO, FUT2 and FUT3 genes seem to confer diminished risk of 
gastroenteritis. Yet, the true extent of this protection remains poorly 
quantified. Here, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the risk of 
consulting at the hospital in non-vaccinated pediatric patients according to the 
ABO, FUT2 (secretor) and FUT3 (Lewis) polymorphisms, in Metropolitan France and 
French Guiana. At both locations, P genotypes were largely dominated by P [8]-3, 
with P [6] cases exclusively found in French Guiana. The FUT2 null (nonsecretor) 
and FUT3 null (Lewis negative) phenotypes conferred near full protection against 
severe gastroenteritis due to P [8]-3 strains (OR 0.03, 95% CI [0.00-0.21] and 
0.1, 95% CI [0.01-0.43], respectively in Metropolitan France; OR 0.08, 95% CI 
[0.01-0.52] and 0.14, 95%CI [0.01-0.99], respectively in French Guiana). Blood 
group O also appeared protective in Metropolitan France (OR 0.38, 95% CI 
[0.23-0.62]), but not in French Guiana. The discrepancy between the two 
locations was explained by a recruitment at the hospital of less severe cases in 
French Guiana than in Metropolitan France. Considering the frequencies of the 
null ABO, Secretor and Lewis phenotypes, the data indicate that in a Western 
European population, 34% (95% CI [29%; 39%]) of infants are genetically 
protected against rotavirus gastroenteritis of sufficient severity to lead to 
hospital visit.
