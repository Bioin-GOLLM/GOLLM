Host miRNAs are known to modulate the cell response to virus infections. We 
characterized the miRNA-targeted transcriptome of porcine alveolar macrophages 
(PAMs) at early times after infection with a subtype 1.1 strain of PRRSV 
(Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus). We performed the 
immunoprecipitation of RISC (RNA-induced Silencing Complex) followed by 
microarray analysis of the RISC-bound miRNA targets (RIP-Chip) to evaluate the 
relative enrichment or depletion of expressed genes in RISC. The miRNA-mediated 
regulation occurred early after PRRSV infection and decreased fast (1,241 and 
141 RISC-bound genes at 7 h and 10 h post-infection, respectively); it affected 
several cell functions with evidence of miRNA buffering of upregulated 
interferon-related genes. Eight miRNAs were highly enriched in RISC of both 
control and infected cells with no evidence of differential expression. Although 
miR-335-5p was the miRNA with most predicted targets among enriched RISC-bound 
genes, no effects on surface markers, cytokine expression and PRRSV replication 
were detected upon miR-335-5p mimics of primary PAMs. Our results do not point 
to specific miRNA-driven mechanisms regulating the early response to infection 
with this PRRSV 1.1 strain and indicate that the miRNome expressed by 
steady-state PAMs reacts promptly to counterbalance PRRSV infection by a 
pervasive modulation of host functions.
