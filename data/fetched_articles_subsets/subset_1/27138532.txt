Immunotherapy is one of the most promising and innovative approaches to treat 
cancer, viral infections, and other immune-modulated diseases. Adoptive 
immunotherapy using gene-modified T cells is an exciting and rapidly evolving 
field. Exploiting knowledge of basic T cell biology and immune cell receptor 
function has fostered innovative approaches to modify immune cell function. 
Highly translatable clinical technologies have been developed to redirect T cell 
specificity by introducing designed receptors. The ability to engineer T cells 
to manifest desired phenotypes and functions is now a thrilling reality. In this 
review, we focus on outlining different varieties of genetically engineered T 
cells, their respective advantages and disadvantages as tools for immunotherapy, 
and their promise and drawbacks in the clinic.
