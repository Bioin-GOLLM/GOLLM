Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (THypoKPP) is an uncommon disorder 
with an unknown etiology. We describe a family in which the proband presented 
with paralysis and thyrotoxicosis. Because of similarities between familial 
hypokalemic periodic paralysis (FHypoKPP) and THypoKPP, we sequenced exon 12 of 
the SCN4A gene, which is known to be mutated in FHypoKPP. We identified an 
Arg672Ser mutation in the proband and his affected father, as well as the 
proband's brother. As the brother has paralysis without thyrotoxicosis, our 
finding suggests that the genetic spectrum of FHypoKPP and THypoKPP overlap. We 
speculate that thyroid hormone may exert a threshold or permissive effect in 
hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Non-thyrotoxic family members of individuals 
with THypoKPP may have an unrecognized risk for paralysis.
