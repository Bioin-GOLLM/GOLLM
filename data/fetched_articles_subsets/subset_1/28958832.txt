BACKGROUND: GTP cyclohydrolase 1-deficient DOPA-responsive dystonia, caused by 
autosomal dominant mutation in the gene coding for GTP cyclohydrolase 1, is a 
rare disorder with a reported prevalence of 0.5 per million. A correct diagnosis 
of DRD is crucial, given that this is an exquisitely treatable neurogenetic 
disorder. Although genetic testing is now widely available, we hypothesize that 
DRD is still underdiagnosed and its prevalence underestimated.
METHODS: Molecular genetic analysis of the GCH1 gene was performed in a 
representative cohort of 47 Serbian patients with clinical features of DRD and 
in their 16 available relatives. The DRD prevalence rate in Serbia was estimated 
based on population size, catchment area, and the centralized Serbian referral 
system for rare diseases.
RESULTS: We identified 9 different GCH1 mutations in 23 individuals from 11 
families, 5 of which are novel. Patients displayed a broad range of clinical 
phenotypes. The estimated prevalence of GCH1-related DOPA-responsive dystonia in 
Serbia was 2.96 per million individuals and there was no evidence for a common 
founder.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand the genotypic spectrum of GCH1 and confirm the 
broad phenotypic spectrum of DRD in the Serbian population. The number of 
detected mutation carriers in this sample implies that the frequency of DRD in 
the Serbian population is considerably higher than expected based on published 
prevalence rates, suggesting that the prevalence of this treatable disease 
should be revisited also in other populations.
