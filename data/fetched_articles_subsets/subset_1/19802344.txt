HIV-1 Assembly at the Plasma Membrane: Gag Trafficking and Localization.

Ono A.

Virus particle formation of HIV-1 is a multi-step process driven by a viral 
structural protein Gag. This process takes place at the plasma membrane in most 
cell types. However, the pathway that directs Gag to the plasma membrane has 
recently come under intense scrutiny because of its importance in production of 
progeny virions as well as virus transmission at cell-cell contacts. This review 
highlights recent advances in our current understanding of mechanisms that 
traffic and localize Gag to the plasma membrane. In addition, findings on Gag 
association with specific plasma membrane domains are discussed in light of 
potential roles in cell-to-cell transmission.
