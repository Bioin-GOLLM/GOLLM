Epithelial protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN) is a cytoskeleton-associated protein 
encoded by a gene that is down-regulated in transformed cells. EPLIN increases 
the number and size of actin stress fibers and inhibits membrane ruffling 
induced by Rac. EPLIN has at least two actin binding sites. Purified recombinant 
EPLIN inhibits actin filament depolymerization and cross-links filaments in 
bundles. EPLIN does not affect the kinetics of spontaneous actin polymerization 
or elongation at the barbed end, but inhibits branching nucleation of actin 
filaments by Arp2/3 complex. Side binding activity may stabilize filaments and 
account for the inhibition of nucleation mediated by Arp2/3 complex. We propose 
that EPLIN promotes the formation of stable actin filament structures such as 
stress fibers at the expense of more dynamic actin filament structures such as 
membrane ruffles. Reduced expression of EPLIN may contribute to the motility of 
invasive tumor cells.
