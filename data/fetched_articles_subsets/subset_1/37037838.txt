Cardiac manifestation of classical Fabry disease (cFD) varies with sex and 
presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. p.D313Y/p.A143T variants (vFD) 
represent milder late-onset phenotypes, however, data on vFD are scarce. 
Patients with FD (cFD = 37;vFD = 14) and 14 healthy controls underwent 1.5 T CMR 
including Cine, LGE, native T1 mapping(nT1) and myocardial strain(CMR-FT). 
CMR-FT was assessed using ventricular longitudinal, circumferential, radial 
(LV-GLS/RV-GLS, LV-GCS/LV-GRS), and atrial longitudinal strain (LA/RATotal, 
LA/RAConduit, LA/RABooster). In cFD reduced myocardial strain (LV-GLS: -20 ± 4 
vs. -24 ± 3%,p = 0.007; LV-GCS: -20 ± 4 vs. -26 ± 4%,p = 0.002, LA Total -GLS: 
29 ± 10 vs. 37 ± 6%,p = 0.007; LA Conduit -GLS: 15 ± 10 vs. 23 ± 5%,p = 0.003) 
and nT1 values (951 ± 51 ms vs. 1036 ± 20 ms, p < 0.001) were observed compared 
to controls. In vFD findings were comparable to controls. LV-GCS provided the 
closest Area under the curve (AUC) to nT1 (0.84 vs. 0.92, p > 0.05) for 
discrimination of cFD versus controls. Significantly lower LV-GLS/LV-GCS was 
found in male compared to female cFD (-19 ± 4 vs. -22 ± 4%, p = 0.03). In six 
non-hypertrophied female cFD with normal nT1 LATotal -GLS was the only 
discriminating parameter with an accuracy of 86%. LV-GLS, LV-GCS and 
LATotal -GLS can detect impaired cardiac mechanics of cFD besides nT1. 
LATotal -GLS might identify non-hypertrophied female cFD. Variants 
p.D313Y/p.A143T did not reveal cardiac involvement by multiparametric CMR.
