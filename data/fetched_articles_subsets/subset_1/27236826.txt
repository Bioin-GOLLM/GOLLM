OBJECTIVE: Metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) subjects have better metabolic 
parameters than metabolically abnormal obesity (MAO) subjects, but the possible 
mechanisms underlying this remain unknown. Our study was designed to investigate 
the interrelationships among genes, adipokines, body fat and its distribution in 
MHO and MAO.
METHODS: From 2007 to 2009, 103 males and 131 females aged 18-50 years were 
enrolled by an intention-to-treat design in a weight management clinic. 
Participants were divided into MHO and MAO groups. Percent body fat (PBF) was 
measured by a deuterium oxide dilution method. Four polymorphic variants, 
including PPARγ2 (Pro12Ala and C1431T) and adiponectin (T45G and G276T) genes, 
and three adipokines (adiponectin, leptin and resistin) were obtained.
RESULTS: Of the 234 obese subjects, 130 (55.6%) were MHO. In the univariate 
analysis, the MAO group has significantly higher anthropometric, metabolic 
indices and leptin levels than the MHO group. Logistic regression analysis 
revealed that age, male gender, the T allele of adiponectin T45G polymorphism, 
leptin and PBF were positively associated with MAO. ANCOVA analysis revealed 
that the T allele of adiponectin T45G polymorphism was associated with higher 
fasting and postprandial glucose levels. We further found that TT genotype has a 
lower high molecular weight (HMW)/low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin ratio 
than GG genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The factors associated with MAO are age, male gender, the T allele 
of adiponectin T45G polymorphism, leptin, and PBF. The net effects of T45G 
polymorphism on the MAO phenotype may be achieved by changes in the adiponectin 
oligomer ratio and glucose levels.
