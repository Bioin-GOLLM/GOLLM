Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a histone modifier for transcriptional 
repression involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis. We previously reported 
that a LSD1 inhibitor NCD38 induces transdifferentiation from erythroid lineage 
to granulomonocytic lineage and exerts anti-leukemia effect through 
de-repression of the specific super-enhancers of hematopoietic regulators 
including ERG in a human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL. However, the 
mechanistic basis for this specificity of NCD38 has remained unclear. Herein, we 
report major partners associated with LSD1 and clarify the mechanism in HEL 
cells. Proteome analysis identified 54 candidate proteins associated with LSD1, 
including several transcription factors such as GFI1B and RUNX1 as well as 
BRAF-histone deacetylase complex (BHC) components such as CoREST, HDAC1, and 
HDAC2. NCD38 selectively disrupted the interaction of LSD1 with GFI1B but not 
with RUNX1, CoREST, HDAC1 and HDAC2. Erg was downregulated in murine erythroid 
progenitors with prominent upregulation of Gfi1b. NCD38 induced ERG and 
attenuated an erythroid marker CD235a in HEL while this attenuation was mimicked 
by the lentiviral overexpression of ERG. The ERG super-enhancer contained the 
conserved binding motif of GFI1B and was actually occupied by GFI1B. NCD38 
dissociated LSD1 and CoREST but not GFI1B from the ERG super-enhancer. 
Collectively, the selective separation of LSD1 from GFI1B by NCD38 restores the 
ERG super-enhancer activation and consequently upregulates ERG expression, 
inducing the transdifferentiation linked to the anti-leukemia effect.
