The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a current world-wide 
public health threat. However, little is known about its hallmarks compared to 
other infectious diseases. Here, we report the single-cell transcriptional 
landscape of longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
in both COVID-19- and influenza A virus (IAV)-infected patients. We observed 
increase of plasma cells in both COVID-19 and IAV patients and XIAP associated 
factor 1 (XAF1)-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and FAS-induced T cell apoptosis 
in COVID-19 patients. Further analyses revealed distinct signaling pathways 
activated in COVID-19 (STAT1 and IRF3) versus IAV (STAT3 and NFκB) patients and 
substantial differences in the expression of key factors. These factors include 
relatively increase of interleukin (IL)6R and IL6ST expression in COVID-19 
patients but similarly increased IL-6 concentrations compared to IAV patients, 
supporting the clinical observations of increased proinflammatory cytokines in 
COVID-19 patients. Thus, we provide the landscape of PBMCs and unveil distinct 
immune response pathways in COVID-19 and IAV patients.
