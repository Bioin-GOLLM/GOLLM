BACKGROUND: Researchers have determined that Indians face a higher risk of heart 
disease, despite the fact that nearly half of them are vegetarians and lack many 
of the other traditional risk factors. In the below-30 age group, coronary 
artery disease mortality among Indians is three-fold higher than in the whites 
in United Kingdom and ten-fold higher than the Chinese in Singapore. High levels 
of homocysteine have been widely linked to the early onset of heart diseases in 
other populations, although a definite proof among Indians is lacking, which 
needs to be investigated by way of screening for factors responsible for high 
homocysteine levels.
OBJECTIVE: To screen for genetic factors responsible for hyperhomocysteinemia 
and the risk for premature coronary artery disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 individuals with proven premature coronary 
artery disease and 200 age-and-sex matched controls were screened for 
polymorphisms in Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (C677T) Methionine 
synthase (MS) genes (A2756G, C2758G), and the B12 and Folate levels were 
estimated.
RESULTS: Results from the mutational analysis revealed that in the study group, 
seven individuals had a polymorphism for the C677T allele in the MTHFR gene (one 
homozygous and six heterozygous) (Fischer's Exact test P > 0.046) (OR: 0.2711 
95% CI 0.0774 to 0.9491). Six were heterozygous for the A2756G polymorphism in 
the MS gene (Fischer's Exact test P > 0.0012). None showed a polymorphism at the 
C2758G allele in the MS gene. Four controls showed heterozygosity for the C677T 
polymorphism and none for the MS gene. The B12 and Folate levels were 
significantly lower in the study group as compared to the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to know which factors determine the total 
homocysteine concentrations. In the general population, the most important 
modifiable determinants of tHcy are folate intake and coffee consumption. 
Smoking and alcohol consumption are also associated with the total homocysteine 
concentrations, but more research is necessary to elucidate whether these 
relations are not originating from residual confounding due to other lifestyle 
factors.
