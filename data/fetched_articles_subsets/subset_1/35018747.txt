BACKGROUND: The variable response to fat-soluble vitamin supplementation in 
young children with cystic fibrosis (CF), and factors contributing to this 
variability, remain under-investigated.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if recommended supplement doses normalize serum vitamins 
A (retinol), D (25-hydroxy-vitamin D, 25OHD), and E (α-tocopherol), and identify 
factors predictive of achieving sufficiency, in children with CF in the first 3 
years of life.
DESIGN: We studied 144 infants born during 2012-2017 and diagnosed with CF 
through newborn screening. Serum retinol, 25OHD, α-tocopherol and plasma 
cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
were measured in early infancy and yearly thereafter. Vitamin supplement intakes 
and respiratory microbiology were assessed every 1-2 months in infancy and 
quarterly thereafter.
RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) at all ages 
combined was significantly higher (22%) compared to vitamin A (<200 ng/ml, 3%) 
and vitamin E (<5 µg/ml, 5%). All children were vitamin A sufficient by age 2 
years. Vitamin E insufficiency was rare. Only 42% were early responders of 
vitamin D and 17% remain insufficient despite high supplement intakes. IL-6 was 
positively correlated, while IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α were negatively correlated, 
with retinol and 25OHD. Multiple regression analysis revealed that supplement 
dose, season, α-tocopherol, pancreatic insufficiency, respiratory infections and 
IL-10 were significant predictors of 25OHD.
CONCLUSION: Diagnosis through newborn screening coupled with supplementation 
normalized serum retinol and α-tocopherol in almost all infants with CF by age 3 
years. However, response to vitamin D supplements in young children with CF 
occurred later and variably despite early and sustained supplementation.
