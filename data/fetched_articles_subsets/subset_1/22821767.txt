BACKGROUND: Detection of fusion gene TMPRSS2:ERG transcripts in urine have been 
recently described in order to refine urine-based detection of prostate cancer 
(PCa), but data its clinical impact remain scarce. We aimed at investigating the 
correlation of TMPRSS2:ERG, prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) density, genetic variants, and androgenic status with outcome and 
pathological findings at prostatic biopsy.
METHODS: Between 2007 and 2011, 291 patients at risk of PCa because of 
PSA > 3.0 ng/ml (55%) or candidate to active surveillance protocol justifying 
restaging biopsy management (45%) were recruited. TMPRSS2:ERG was detected by 
urine assay (Progensa™). PCA3-score, PSA level, bioavailable testosterone level, 
prostate volume, rs1447295 and rs6983267 genotypes were prospectively assessed. 
Univariate and multivariate analysis by logistic regression model (logit) were 
conducted to study the correlation of TMPRSS2:ERG status, PCA3, and PSA density 
with biopsy results, and Gleason score.
RESULTS: Of 291 patients, 173 had PCa and 118 had negative biopsy. PCA3 score, 
PSA density and TMPRSS2:ERG-score were correlated with presence of PCa 
(P < 0.0001, P = 0.046, and P < 0.0001, respectively). This correlation remained 
strong on multivariable analysis model (area under curve 0.743). PCA3 score and 
PSA density were significantly associated with presence of Grade 4 through 
multivariable analysis. PCA3 score was also correlated to the percentage of 
positive cores at biopsy (P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of levels TMPRSS2:ERG transcripts in urine, with 
PCA3-score, androgenic status, genetic status and traditional clinical variables 
could significantly increase detection of high risk localized PCa.
