Deficiencies of carbamoylphosphate synthetase or of ornithine transcarbamylase, 
two urea cycle enzymes located within mitochondria, often present as severe 
neonatal hyperammonaemic crises and have a poor prognosis. While genetic 
analysis of the X-chromosomal transmitted ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency 
(OTC) is performed by exon-wise mutation screening of genomic DNA in most cases, 
identification of mutations in the autosomal inherited carbamoylphosphate 
synthetase (CPS 1) deficiency requires analysis of transcripts due to the 
unknown genomic structure. We tested the hypothesis that CPS 1 and OTC are 
expressed at low levels in fibroblasts and indeed were able to amplify 
full-length cDNA from that source. Using a reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction based procedure we completely characterised the genetic 
background in five patients and identified three novel mutations and a novel 
polymorphism of the CPS 1 gene (deletion/insertion 2170delGCTCinsCCA, nonsense 
mutation 2359C > T, missense mutation 3161T > G and Thr1406Asn, respectively), 
as well as the missense mutations 482A > G and 994T > A of the OTC gene.
CONCLUSION: Cultured fibroblasts are an easily accessible source for genetic 
analysis of inborn errors of urea cycle enzymes which are functionally expressed 
only in liver and gut.
