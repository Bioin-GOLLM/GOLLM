BACKGROUND: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula is the most common spinal 
vascular malformation. It usually presents with neurological deficits due to 
venous congestive myelopathy. Sometimes, however, the symptoms are radicular and 
can imitate those of a disc hernia or synovial cyst.
OBSERVATIONS: In this illustrated case, a 34-year-old male patient presented 
with radicular pain due to nerve root compression. In the magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) examination of the spine, a synovial cyst was suspected, so the 
patient underwent no further examination before surgery. Intraoperatively, the 
authors were surprised to see a vascular malformation, which was shown to be an 
extradural arteriovenous fistula according to the histopathological examination.
LESSONS: In atypical MRI findings of the spine, vascular malformations should be 
considered. In cases with a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, the thrombosis 
risk can be high and lead to a need for prolonged anticoagulation.
