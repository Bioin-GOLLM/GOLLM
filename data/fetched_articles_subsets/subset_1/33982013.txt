The core subunit of the MORF acetyltransferase complex BRPF1 contains a unique 
combination of zinc fingers, including a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger followed 
by a zinc knuckle and another PHD finger, which together form a PZP domain 
(BRPF1PZP). BRPF1PZP has been shown to bind to the nucleosome and make contacts 
with both histone H3 tail and DNA. Here, we describe biophysical and structural 
methods for characterization of the interactions between BRPF1PZP, H3 tail, DNA, 
and the intact nucleosome. For complete details on the use and execution of this 
protocol, please refer to Klein et al. (2020).
