Breakdown of endothelial barrier integrity determines organ dysfunction and 
outcome of patients with sepsis. Increased levels of soluble vascular 
endothelial (VE)-cadherin fragments (sVE-cadherin) have previously been linked 
with inflammation-induced loss of endothelial barrier function. We provide 
evidence for a causative role of sVE-cadherin to induce loss of endothelial 
barrier function. In patients with sepsis, sVE-cadherin levels were associated 
with organ dysfunction and the need for volume resuscitation. Similarly, 
LPS-induced systemic inflammation in rats with microvascular dysfunction was 
paralleled by augmented sVE-cadherin levels. Newly generated recombinant human 
sVE-cadherin (extracellular domains EC1-5) induced loss of endothelial barrier 
function in both human microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and in rat 
mesenteric microvessels in vivo and reduced microcirculatory flow. 
sVE-cadherinEC1-5 disturbed VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion and perturbed 
VE-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP)/VE-cadherin interaction resulting in 
RhoGEF1-mediated RhoA activation. VE-PTP inhibitor AKB9778 and Rho-kinase 
inhibitor Y27632 blunted all sVE-cadherinEC1-5-induced effects, which uncovers a 
pathophysiological role of sVE-cadherin via dysbalanced VE-PTP/RhoA signaling.
