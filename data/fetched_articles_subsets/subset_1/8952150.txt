BACKGROUND: alpha thalassemias are very common in all thalassemic areas; 
however, complete knowledge of the phenotypic, genotypic and epidemiological 
features of these thalassemias has not yet been achieved for a number of 
reasons: the frequent absence of a thalassemic hematologic picture, the lack of 
a specific characteristic comparable to the Hb A2 increase for beta 
thalassemias, and the almost complete homology between the two alpha genes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A new set of PCR techniques, each based on primer(s) 
specific for a particular type of alpha globin gene disorder, has been devised 
in our laboratory. The procedures are simple, and non-radioactive. They lead to 
the identification of all alpha globin disorders common in the Mediterranean 
area [-alpha 3.7, -alpha 4.2, alpha Hphl, alpha Ncol, --MED, -(alpha)20.5, alpha 
alpha alpha anti3.7]. The electrophoretic patterns specific for the main alpha 
globin alterations as observed with this set of techniques, are presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Owing to their advantageous properties, these techniques are 
suitable for precise molecular characterization of the numerous subjects 
selected through mass population screenings.
