Dengue has become the most important arboviral infection worldwide with more 
than 30 million cases of dengue fever estimated to occur each year. The need for 
a dengue vaccine is great and several live attenuated dengue candidate vaccines 
are proceeding through clinical evaluation. The need to induce a balanced immune 
response against all four DENV serotypes with a single vaccine has been a 
challenge for dengue vaccine developers. A live attenuated DENV chimeric vaccine 
produced by Sanofi Pasteur has recently entered Phase III evaluation in numerous 
dengue-endemic regions of the world. Viral interference between serotypes 
contained in live vaccines has required up to three doses of the vaccine be 
given over a 12-month period of time. For this reason, novel DENV candidate 
vaccines are being developed with the goal of achieving a protective immune 
response with an immunization schedule that can be given over the course of a 
few months. These next-generation candidates include DNA vaccines, recombinant 
adenovirus vectored vaccines, alphavirus replicons, and sub-unit protein 
vaccines. Several of these novel candidates will be discussed.
