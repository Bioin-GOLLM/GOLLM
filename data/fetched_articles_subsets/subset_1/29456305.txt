BACKGROUND: Management of furcation defects is challenging, and constantly newer 
therapeutic strategies are evolving. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is successfully 
used alone and in combination with various agents in the furcation defects. 
Lately, metformin (MF), a second generation biguanide has gained popularity 
owing to its osteogenic potential.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical 
and radiographic effectiveness of open flap debridement (OFD) and PRF when 
compared to OFD + PRF + 1% MF gel in the management of mandibular Grade II 
furcation defects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty mandibular grade II furcation defects were 
stratified into two groups; in one group OFD and PRF is used, and the other 
group had an additional MF gel with PRF in OFD. Clinical parameters such as 
plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, probing pocket depth (PD), 
relative vertical attachment level (RVAL), and relative horizontal attachment 
level (RHAL) were recorded at baseline and at 6 months. Radiovisiography and 
ImageJ software were used to evaluate the intrabony defect depth.
RESULTS: The OFD + PRF + MF group showed significantly higher probing PD 
reduction, RVAL and RHAL gain than the OFD + PRF group.
CONCLUSIONS: PRF when combined with a potential osteogenic agent like MF can 
provide a better therapeutic benefit to a furcation involved tooth.
