Chorea-acanthocytosis (CHAC, MIM 200150) is an autosomal recessive 
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual onset of hyperkinetic 
movements and abnormal erythrocyte morphology (acanthocytosis). Neurological 
findings closely resemble those observed in Huntington disease. We identified a 
gene in the CHAC critical region and found 16 different mutations in individuals 
with chorea-acanthocytosis. CHAC encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein 
that is probably involved in protein sorting.
