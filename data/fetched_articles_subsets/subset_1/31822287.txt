BACKGROUND: Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common 
congenital infection and a leading cause of long-term neurological and sensory 
sequelae, the most common being sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Despite 
extensive research, clinical or laboratory markers to identify CMV infected 
children with increased risk for disease have not been identified. This study 
utilizes viral whole-genome next generation-sequencing (NGS) of specimens from 
congenitally infected infants to explore viral diversity and specific viral 
variants that may be associated with symptomatic infection and SNHL.
METHODS: CMV DNA from urine specimens of 30 infants (17 asymptomatic, 13 
symptomatic) was target enriched and next generation sequenced resulting in 93% 
coverage of the CMV genome allowing analysis of viral diversity.
RESULTS: Variant frequency distribution was compared between children with 
symptomatic and asymptomatic cCMV and those with (n = 13) and without (n = 17) 
hearing loss. The CMV genes UL48A, UL88, US19 and US22 were found to have an 
increase in nucleotide diversity in symptomatic children; while UL57, UL20, 
UL104, US14, UL115, and UL35 had an increase in diversity in children with 
hearing loss. An analysis of single variant differences between symptomatic and 
asymptomatic children found UL55 to have the highest number, while the most 
variants associated with SNHL were in the RL11 gene family. In asymptomatic 
infants with SNHL, mutations were observed more frequently in UL33 and UL20.
CONCLUSION: CMV genomes from infected newborns can be mapped to 93% of the 
genome at a depth allowing accurate and reproducible analysis of polymorphisms 
for variant and gene discovery that may be linked to symptomatic and hearing 
loss outcomes.
