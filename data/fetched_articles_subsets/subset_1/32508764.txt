We explored an emerging technology to produce anti-Hantaan virus (HTNV) and 
anti-Puumala virus (PUUV) neutralizing antibodies for use as pre- or 
post-exposure prophylactics. The technology involves hyperimmunization of 
transchomosomic bovines (TcB) engineered to express human polyclonal IgG 
antibodies with HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines encoding GnGc glycoproteins. For the 
anti-HTNV product, TcB was hyperimmunized with HTNV DNA plus adjuvant or HTNV 
DNA formulated using lipid nanoparticles (LNP). The LNP-formulated vaccine 
yielded fivefold higher neutralizing antibody titers using 10-fold less DNA. 
Human IgG purified from the LNP-formulated animal (SAB-159), had anti-HTNV 
neutralizing antibody titers >100,000. SAB-159 was capable of neutralizing 
pseudovirions with monoclonal antibody escape mutations in Gn and Gc 
demonstrating neutralization escape resistance. SAB-159 protected hamsters from 
HTNV infection when administered pre- or post-exposure, and limited HTNV 
infection in a marmoset model. An LNP-formulated PUUV DNA vaccine generated 
purified anti-PUUV IgG, SAB-159P, with a neutralizing antibody titer >600,000. 
As little as 0.33 mg/kg of SAB-159P protected hamsters against PUUV infection 
for pre-exposure and 10 mg/kg SAB-159P protected PUUV-infected hamsters 
post-exposure. These data demonstrate that DNA vaccines combined with the 
TcB-based manufacturing platform can be used to rapidly produce potent, human, 
polyclonal, escape-resistant anti-HTNV, and anti-PUUV neutralizing antibodies 
that are protective in animal models.
