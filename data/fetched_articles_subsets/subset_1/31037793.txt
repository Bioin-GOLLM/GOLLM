There are a wealth of tools for fitting linear models at each location in the 
brain in neuroimaging analysis, and a wealth of genetic tools for estimating 
heritability for a small number of phenotypes. But there remains a need for 
computationally efficient neuroimaging genetic tools that can conduct analyses 
at the brain-wide scale. Here we present a simple method for heritability 
estimation on twins that replaces a variance component model-which requires 
iterative optimisation-with a (noniterative) linear regression model, by 
transforming data to squared twin-pair differences. We demonstrate that the 
method has comparable bias, mean squared error, false positive risk, and power 
to best practice maximum-likelihood-based methods, while requiring a small 
fraction of the computation time. Combined with permutation, we call this 
approach "Accelerated Permutation Inference for the ACE Model (APACE)" where ACE 
refers to the additive genetic (A) effects, and common (C), and unique (E) 
environmental influences on the trait. We show how the use of spatial statistics 
like cluster size can dramatically improve power, and illustrate the method on a 
heritability analysis of an fMRI working memory dataset.
