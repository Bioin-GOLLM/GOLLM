BACKGROUND: Streptomyces mobaraenesis transglutaminase (smTG) is widely used to 
generate protein crosslinking or attachment of small molecules. However, the low 
thermostability is a main obstacle for smTG application. In addition, it is 
still hard to achieve the secretory expression of active smTG in E. coli, which 
benefits the enzyme evolution. In this study, a combined strategy was conducted 
to improve the thermostability and secretory expression of active smTG in E. 
coli.
RESULTS: First, the thermostable S. mobaraenesis transglutaminase variant 
S2P-S23V-Y24N-S199A-K294L (TGm1) was intracellularly expressed in pro-enzyme 
form in E. coli. Fusing the pro-region of Streptomyces hygroscopicus 
transglutaminase (proH) and TrxA achieved a 9.78 U/mL of intracellular smTG 
activity, 1.37-fold higher than the TGm1 fused with its native pro-region. After 
in vitro activation by dispase, the TGm1 with proH yielded FRAPD-TGm1, 
exhibiting 0.95 ℃ and 94.25% increases in melting temperature and half-life at 
60 ℃ compared to FRAP-TGm1 derived from the expression using its native 
pro-region, respectively. Second, the TGm1 with proH was co-expressed with 
transglutaminase activating protease and chaperones (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) in E. 
coli, achieving 9.51 U/mL of intracellular FRAPD-TGm1 without in vitro 
activation. Third, the pelB signal peptide was used to mediate the secretory 
expression of active TGm in E. coli, yielding 0.54 U/mL of the extracellular 
FRAPD-TGm1. A script was developed to shuffle the codon of pelB and calculate 
the corresponding mRNA folding energy. A 1.8-fold increase in the extracellular 
expression of FRAPD-TGm1 was achieved by the Top-9 pelB sequence derived from 
the coding sequences with the lowest mRNA folding energy. Last, deleting the 
gene of Braun's lipoprotein further increased the extracellular yield of 
FRAPD-TGm1 by 31.2%, reached 1.99 U/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: The stabilized FRAPD-smTG here could benefit the enzyme application 
in food and non-food sectors, while the E. coli system that enables secretory 
expression of active smTG will facilitate the directed evolution for further 
improved catalytic properties. The combined strategy (N-terminal modification, 
co-expression with chaperones, mRNA folding energy optimization of signal 
peptide, and lipoprotein deletion) may also improve the secretory expression of 
other functional proteins in E. coli.
