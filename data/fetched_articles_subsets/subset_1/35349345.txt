SignificanceDNA needs to be compacted to fit into nuclei and during cell 
division, when dense chromatids are formed for their mechanical segregation, a 
process that depends on the protein complex condensin. It forms and enlarges 
loops in DNA through loop extrusion. Our work resolves the atomic structure of a 
DNA-bound state of condensin in which ATP has not been hydrolyzed. The DNA is 
clamped within a compartment that has been reported previously in other 
structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes, including Rad50, cohesin, 
and MukBEF. With the caveat of important differences, it means that all SMC 
complexes cycle through at least some similar states and undergo similar 
conformational changes in their head modules, while hydrolyzing ATP and 
translocating DNA.
