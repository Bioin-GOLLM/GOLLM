OBJECTIVES: We evaluated factors associated with pathogenic genetic variants in 
patients with idiopathic pancreatitis.
METHODS: Genetic testing (PRSS1, CFTR, SPINK1, and CTRC) was performed in all 
eligible patients with idiopathic pancreatitis between 2010 to 2015. Patients 
were classified into the following groups based on a review of medical records: 
(1) acute recurrent idiopathic pancreatitis (ARIP) with or without underlying 
chronic pancreatitis; (2) idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) without a 
history of ARP; (3) an unexplained first episode of acute pancreatitis (AP)<35 
years of age; and (4) family history of pancreatitis. Logistic regression 
analysis was used to determine the factors associated with pathogenic genetic 
variants.
RESULTS: Among 197 ARIP and/or ICP patients evaluated from 2010 to 2015, 134 
underwent genetic testing. A total of 88 pathogenic genetic variants were found 
in 64 (47.8%) patients. Pathogenic genetic variants were identified in 58, 63, 
and 27% of patients with ARIP, an unexplained first episode of AP <35 years of 
age, and ICP without ARP, respectively. ARIP (OR: 18.12; 95% CI: 2.16-151.87; 
P=0.008) and an unexplained first episode of AP<35 years of age (OR: 2.46; 95% 
CI: 1.18-5.15; P=0.017), but not ICP, were independently associated with 
pathogenic genetic variants in the adjusted analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic genetic variants are most likely to be identified in 
patients with ARIP and an unexplained first episode of AP<35 years of age. 
Genetic testing in these patient populations may delineate an etiology and 
prevent unnecessary diagnostic testing and procedures.
