Tachycardia is characterized by high beating rates that can lead to 
life-threatening fibrillations. Mutations in several ion-channel genes were 
implicated with tachycardia; however, the complex genetic contributors and their 
modes of action are still unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of an 
SCN5A gene variant on tachycardia phenotype by deriving patient-specific iPSCs 
and cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM). Two tachycardia patients were genetically analyzed 
and revealed to inherit a heterozygous p.F1465L variant in the SCN5A gene. Gene 
expression and immunocytochemical analysis in iPSC-CMs generated from patients 
did not show any significant changes in mRNA levels of SCN5A or gross NaV1.5 
cellular mislocalization, compared to healthy-derived iPSC-CMs. 
Electrophysiological and contraction imaging analysis in patient iPSC-CMs 
revealed intermittent fibrillation-like states, occasional arrhythmic events, 
and sustained high-paced contractions that could be selectively reduced by 
flecainide treatment. The patch-clamp analysis demonstrated a negative shift in 
the voltage-dependent activation at the patient-derived iPSC-CMs compared to the 
healthy control line, suggestive of a gain-of-function activity associated with 
the SCN5A+/p.F1465L variant. Our patient-derived iPSC-CM model recapitulated the 
clinically relevant characteristics of tachycardia associated with a novel 
pathogenic SCN5A+/p.F1465L variant leading to altered Na+ channel kinetics as 
the likely mechanism underlying high excitability and tachycardia phenotype.
