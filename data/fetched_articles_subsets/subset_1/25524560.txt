BACKGROUND: Host SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) 
suppresses reverse transcription kinetics of HIV-1 in nondividing cells such as 
macrophages by hydrolyzing and nearly depleting cellular dNTPs, which are the 
substrates of viral reverse transcriptase (RT). However, unlike HIV-1, HIV-2 and 
SIVsm encode viral protein X (Vpx), which counteracts the dNTPase activity of 
SAMHD1 and elevates dNTP concentration, allowing the viruses to replicate under 
abundant dNTP conditions even in nondividing cells.
FINDINGS: Here we tested whether RTs of these Vpx coding and noncoding 
lentiviruses display different enzyme kinetic profiles in response to dNTP 
concentrations. For this test, we characterized an extensive collection of RTs 
from 7 HIV-1 strains, 4 HIV-2 strains and 7 SIV strains, and determined their 
steady-state kinetic parameters. The K m values of all HIV-1 RTs were 
consistently low and close to the low dNTP concentrations found in macrophages. 
However, the K m values of SIV and HIV-2 RTs were not only higher than those of 
HIV-1 RTs but also varied significantly, indicating that HIV-2/SIV RTs require 
higher dNTP concentrations for efficient DNA synthesis, compared to HIV-1 RT. 
However, the k cat values of all eighteen lentiviral RTs were very similar.
CONCLUSIONS: Our biochemical analysis supports the hypothesis that the 
enzymological properties, particularly, K m values, of lentivirus RTs, are 
mechanistically tied with the cellular dNTP availability in nondividing target 
cells, which is controlled by SAMHD1 and Vpx.
