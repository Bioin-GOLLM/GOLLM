A cloned tryptophan-synthesis gene from the ascomycete Cochliobolus 
heterostrophus functions in Escherichia coli, yeast and Aspergillus nidulans.

A gene (TRP1) in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway of the fungal plant 
pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus was isolated by complementation of an 
Escherichia coli trpF mutant which lacked phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase 
(PRAI) activity. The cloned gene also complemented an E. coli trpC mutant 
lacking indoleglycerolphosphate synthase (IGPS) activity, a yeast trp1 mutant 
missing PRAI activity and an Aspergillus nidulans trpC mutant. It functioned in 
E. coli and A. nidulans without apparent rearrangement but in yeast only after 
the 5' end of the gene was deleted. The gene was subcloned on a 4.65-kb DNA 
fragment and the PRAI domain was localized to a 2.9-kb region. It showed 
homology to the A. nidulans trpC and Neurospora crassa trp-1 genes. There was 
one predominant transcript of C. heterostrophus TRP1, the same size (2.6-kb) as 
one of the two functional transcripts produced by A. nidulans trpC. The 
constitutive activity of the C. heterostrophus TRP1 gene was high whereas that 
of the A. nidulans trpC gene was low.
