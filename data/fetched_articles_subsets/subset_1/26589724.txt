Autophagy is a critical pathway leading to lysosomal degradation of cellular 
components in response to changes in nutrient availability. Autophagy includes 
the biogenesis of autophagosomes and their sequential maturation through fusion 
with endo-lysosomes. The class III PI3 kinase Vps34 and its product 
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) play a critical role in this process, 
and enable the amino acid-mediated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR), a suppressor of autophagy. Recent studies have shown that phospholipase 
PLD1, a downstream regulator of Vps34, is also closely involved in both mTOR 
activation and autophagy. This mini review summarizes recent findings in the 
regulation of Vps34 and PLD1 and highlights the role of these lipid-metabolizing 
enzymes in both mTOR activation and autophagy.
