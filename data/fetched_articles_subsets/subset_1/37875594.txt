Cataracts are opacifications of the lens that cause loss of visual acuity and 
ultimately of eyesight. Age-related cataract develops in most elderly people, 
but the mechanisms of cataract onset are incompletely understood. The Ihara 
Cataract Rat (ICR) is an animal model of hereditary cataracts showing cortical 
opacity that commonly develops prematurely. We identified putative mechanisms of 
cataract onset in the ICR rat model by measuring gene expression changes before 
and after cortical cataract development and conducting point mutation analysis. 
Genes differentially expressed between 4-week-old animals without cortical 
cataracts and 8-10-week-old animals with cortical cataracts were selected from 
microarray analysis. Three connections were identified by STRING analysis: (i) 
Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), including Col1a2, and Pik3r1. (ii) Lens 
homeostasis, including Aqp5, and Cpm. (iii) Lipid metabolism, including Scd1, 
Srebf1, and Pnpla3. Subsequently, mutation points were selected by comparing ICR 
rats with 12 different rats that do not develop cataracts. The apolipoprotein 
Apoc3 was mutated in ICR rats. Analyses of gene expression changes and point and 
mutations suggested that abnormalities in EMT or lipid metabolism could 
contribute to cataract development in ICR rats.
