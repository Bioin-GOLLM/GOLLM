The formin protein mDia2 plays a critical role in a number of cellular processes 
through its ability to promote nucleation and elongation of actin filaments. In 
erythroblasts, this includes control of cytokinesis and enucleation by 
regulating contractile actin ring formation. Here we report a novel mechanism of 
how mDia2 is regulated: through acetylation and deacetylation at lysine 970 in 
the formin homology 2 domain. Ectopic expression of an acetyl-mimic mDia2 mutant 
in mouse erythroblasts is sufficient to abolish contractile actin ring formation 
at the cleavage furrow and subsequent erythrocyte cytokinesis and enucleation. 
We also identified that class II histone deacetylase 6 deacetylates and 
subsequently activates mDia2. Knockdown or inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 
impairs contractile actin ring formation, and expression of a non-acetyl-mimic 
mDia2 mutant restores the contractile actin ring and rescues the impairment of 
enucleation. In addition to revealing a new step in mDia2 regulation, this study 
may unveil a novel regulatory mechanism of formin-mediated actin assembly, since 
the K970 acetylation site is conserved among Dia proteins.
