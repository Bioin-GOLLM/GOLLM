Hypoxia, a major inducer of angiogenesis, triggers major changes in gene 
expression at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, under hypoxia, global 
protein synthesis is blocked while internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) allow 
specific mRNAs to be translated. Here, we report the transcriptome and 
translatome signatures of (lymph)angiogenic genes in hypoxic HL-1 mouse 
cardiomyocytes: most genes are induced at the translatome level, including all 
IRES-containing mRNAs. Our data reveal activation of (lymph)angiogenic factor 
mRNA IRESs in early hypoxia. We identify vasohibin1 (VASH1) as an IRES 
trans-acting factor (ITAF) that is able to bind RNA and to activate the FGF1 
IRES in hypoxia, but which tends to inhibit several IRESs in normoxia. VASH1 
depletion has a wide impact on the translatome of (lymph)angiogenesis genes, 
suggesting that this protein can regulate translation positively or negatively 
in early hypoxia. Translational control thus appears as a pivotal process 
triggering new vessel formation in ischemic heart.
