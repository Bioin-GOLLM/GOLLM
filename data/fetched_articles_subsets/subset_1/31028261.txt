The development of site-specific recombinases (SSRs) as genome editing agents is 
limited by the difficulty of altering their native DNA specificities. Here we 
describe Rec-seq, a method for revealing the DNA specificity determinants and 
potential off-target substrates of SSRs in a comprehensive and unbiased manner. 
We applied Rec-seq to characterize the DNA specificity determinants of several 
natural and evolved SSRs including Cre, evolved variants of Cre, and other SSR 
family members. Rec-seq profiling of these enzymes and mutants thereof revealed 
previously uncharacterized SSR interactions, including specificity determinants 
not evident from SSR:DNA structures. Finally, we used Rec-seq specificity 
profiles to predict off-target substrates of Tre and Brec1 recombinases, 
including endogenous human genomic sequences, and confirmed their ability to 
recombine these off-target sequences in human cells. These findings establish 
Rec-seq as a high-resolution method for rapidly characterizing the DNA 
specificity of recombinases with single-nucleotide resolution, and for informing 
their further development.
