BACKGROUND: The management of osteoarthritis (OA) remains a challenge. There is 
a need not only for safe and efficient treatments but also for accurate and 
reliable biomarkers that would help diagnosis and monitoring both disease 
activity and treatment efficacy. Curcumin is basically a spice that is known for 
its anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro studies suggest that curcumin could 
be beneficial for cartilage in OA. The aim of this exploratory, non-controlled 
clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of bio-optimized curcumin in knee OA 
patients on the serum levels of specific biomarkers of OA and on the evaluation 
of pain.
METHODS: Twenty two patients with knee OA were asked to take 2x3 caps/day of 
bio-optimized curcumin (Flexofytol®) for 3 months. They were monitored after 7, 
14, 28 and 84 days of treatment. Pain over the last 24 hours and global 
assessment of disease activity by the patient were evaluated using a visual 
analog scale (100 mm). The serum levels of Coll-2-1, Coll-2-1NO2, Fib3-1, 
Fib3-2, CRP, CTX-II and MPO were determined before and after 14 and 84 days of 
treatment.
RESULTS: The treatment with curcumin was globally well tolerated. It 
significantly reduced the serum level of Coll2-1 (p<0.002) and tended to 
decrease CRP. No other significant difference was observed with the other 
biomarkers. In addition, curcumin significantly reduced the global assessment of 
disease activity by the patient.
CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the potential effect of curcumin in knee OA 
patient. This effect was reflected by the variation of a cartilage specific 
biomarker, Coll2-1 that was rapidly affected by the treatment. These results are 
encouraging for the qualification of Coll2-1 as a biomarker for the evaluation 
of curcumin in OA treatment.
