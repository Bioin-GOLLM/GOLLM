BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical factor in the onset and 
progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, mitochondrial 
transplantation has been advised as an innovative and attractive strategy to 
transfer and replace damaged mitochondria. Here we propose, for the first time, 
to use rat brain extracted synaptosomes, a subcellular fraction of isolated 
synaptic terminal that contains mitochondria, as mitochondrial delivery systems.
RESULTS: Synaptosome preparation was validated by the presence of Synaptophysin 
and PSD95. Synaptosomes were characterized in terms of dimension, zeta 
potential, polydispersity index and number of particles/ml. Nile Red or 
CTX-FITCH labeled synaptosomes were internalized in LAN5 recipient cells by a 
mechanism involving specific protein-protein interaction, as demonstrated by 
loss of fusion ability after trypsin treatment and using different cell lines. 
The loading and release ability of the synaptosomes was proved by the presence 
of curcumin both into synaptosomes and LAN5 cells. The vitality of mitochondria 
transferred by Synaptosomes was demonstrated by the presence of Opa1, Fis1 and 
TOM40 mitochondrial proteins and JC-1 measurements. Further, synaptosomes 
deliver vital mitochondria into the cytoplasm of neuronal cells as demonstrated 
by microscopic images, increase of TOM 40, cytochrome c, Hexokinase II 
mitochondrial proteins, and presence of rat mitochondrial DNA. Finally, by using 
synaptosomes as a vehicle, healthy mitochondria restored mitochondrial function 
in cells containing rotenone or CCCp damaged mitochondria.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together these results suggest that synaptosomes can be a 
natural vehicle for the delivery of molecules and organelles to neuronal cells. 
Further, the replacement of affected mitochondria with healthy ones could be a 
potential therapy for treating neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction-related 
diseases.
