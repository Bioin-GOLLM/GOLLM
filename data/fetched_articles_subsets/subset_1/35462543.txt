BACKGROUND: A paucity of studies focused on the genetic association that 
tuberculosis (TB) patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are more likely 
to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) with more potent virulence 
on anti-TB drug resistance than those without NCDs. The study aimed to document 
the predominant genotype, determine the association between MTB genotypes and 
NCD status and drug resistance.
METHODS: We conducted a molecular study in 105 TB patients based on a 
cross-sectional study focused on the comorbid relationship between chronic 
conditions and TB among 1773 subjects from September 1, 2019 to August 30, 2020 
in Guizhou, China. The participants were investigated through face-to-face 
interviews, followed by NCDs screening. The DNA of MTB isolates was extracted 
prior to genotyping using 24 loci MIRU-VNTR. The subsequent evaluations were 
performed by phylogenetic trees, combined with tests of statistical power, 
Chi-square or Fisher and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The Beijing family of Lineage 2 (East Asia) was the predominant 
genotype accounting for 43.8% (46/105), followed by Lineage 4 (Euro-America) 
strains, including Uganda I (34.3%, 36/105), and the NEW-1 (9.5%, 10/105). The 
proportion of Beijing strain in patients with and without NCDS was 28.6% (8/28) 
and 49.4% (38/77), respectively, with a statistical power test value of 24.3%. 
No significant association was detected between MTB genotype and NCD status. A 
low clustering rate (2.9%) was identified, consisting of two clusters. The rates 
of global, mono-, poly- and multi-drug resistance were 16.2% (17/105), 14.3% 
(15/105), 1.0% (1/105) and 4.8% (5/105), respectively. The drug-resistant rates 
of rifampicin, isoniazid, and streptomycin, were 6.7% (7/105), 11.4% (12/105) 
and 5.7% (6/105), respectively. Isoniazid resistance was significantly 
associated with the Beijing genotype of Lineage 2 (19.6% versus 5.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: The Lineage 2 East Asia/Beijing genotype is the dominant genotype 
of the local MTB with endogenous infection preponderating. Not enough evidence 
is detected to support the association between the MTB genotype and 
diabetes/hypertension. Isoniazid resistance is associated with the Lineage 2 
East Asia/Beijing strain.
