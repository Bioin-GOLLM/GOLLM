Our group previously described and mapped to chromosomal region 12p13 a form of 
dominantly inherited hereditary spastic ataxia (HSA) in three large Newfoundland 
(Canada) families. This report identifies vesicle-associated membrane protein 1 
(VAMP1), which encodes a critical protein for synaptic exocytosis, as the 
responsible gene. In total, 50 affected individuals from these families and 
three independent probands from Ontario (Canada) share the disease phenotype 
together with a disruptive VAMP1 mutation that affects a critical donor site for 
the splicing of VAMP1 isoforms. This mutation leads to the loss of the only 
VAMP1 isoform (VAMP1A) expressed in the nervous system, thus highlighting an 
association between the well-studied VAMP1 and a neurological disorder. Given 
the variable phenotype seen in the affected individuals examined here, we 
believe that VAMP1 should be tested for mutations in patients with either ataxia 
or spastic paraplegia.
