Subversion of the host immune system by viruses is often mediated by molecular 
decoys that sequester host proteins pivotal to mounting effective immune 
responses. The widespread mammalian pathogen parapox Orf virus deploys GIF, a 
member of the poxvirus immune evasion superfamily, to antagonize GM-CSF 
(granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and IL-2 (interleukin-2), two 
pleiotropic cytokines of the mammalian immune system. However, structural and 
mechanistic insights into the unprecedented functional duality of GIF have 
remained elusive. Here we reveal that GIF employs a dimeric binding platform 
that sequesters two copies of its target cytokines with high affinity and slow 
dissociation kinetics to yield distinct complexes featuring mutually exclusive 
interaction footprints. We illustrate how GIF serves as a competitive decoy 
receptor by leveraging binding hotspots underlying the cognate receptor 
interactions of GM-CSF and IL-2, without sharing any structural similarity with 
the cytokine receptors. Our findings contribute to the tracing of novel 
molecular mimicry mechanisms employed by pathogenic viruses.
