Cerebrovascular amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) deposition is a pathological 
feature of several related disorders including Alzheimer disease and hereditary 
cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch-type (HCHWA-D). HCHWA-D is caused by 
a point mutation in the gene that encodes the Abeta precursor and results in a 
Glu --> Gln substitution at position 22 of Abeta. In comparison to Alzheimer 
disease, the cerebrovascular Abeta deposition in HCHWA-D is generally more 
severe, often resulting in intracerebral hemorrhage when patients reach 50 years 
of age. We recently reported that Abeta(1-42), but not the shorter Abeta(1-40) 
induces pathologic responses in cultured human leptomeningeal smooth muscle 
cells including cellular degeneration that is accompanied by a marked increase 
in the levels of cellular Abeta precursor and soluble Abeta peptide. In the 
present study, we show that the HCHWA-D mutation converts the normally 
nonpathologic Abeta(1-40) into a highly pathologic form of the peptide for 
cultured human leptomeningeal smooth muscle cells. These findings suggest that 
these altered functional properties of HCHWA-D mutated Abeta may contribute to 
the early and often severe cerebrovascular pathology that is the hallmark of 
this disorder.
