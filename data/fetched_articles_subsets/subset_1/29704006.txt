Release of fatty acids from lipid droplets upon activation of the sympathetic 
nervous system (SNS) is a key step in nonshivering thermogenesis in brown 
adipose tissue (BAT). However, intracellular lipolysis appears not to be 
critical for cold-induced thermogenesis. As activation of the SNS increases 
glucose uptake, we studied whether intracellular glycolysis plays a role in BAT 
thermogenesis. To stimulate BAT-innervating sympathetic nerves in vivo, we 
expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in catecholaminergic fibers by crossbreeding 
tyrosine hydroxylase-Cre mice with floxed-stop ChR2 mice. Acute optogenetic 
stimulation of sympathetic efferent fibers of BAT increased body temperature and 
lowered blood glucose levels that were completely abolished by the Î²-adrenergic 
receptor antagonist. Knockdown of the Ucp1 gene in BAT blocked the effects of 
optogenetic stimulation on body temperature and glucose uptake. Inhibition of 
glucose uptake in BAT and glycolysis abolished optogenetically induced 
thermogenesis. Stimulation of sympathetic nerves upregulated expression of the 
lactate dehydrogenase-A and -B genes in BAT. Optogenetic stimulation failed to 
induce thermogenesis following treatment with the LDH inhibitor. Pharmacological 
blockade and genetic deletion of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 completely 
abolished the effects of sympathetic activation. Our results suggest that 
intracellular glycolysis and lactate shuttle play an important role in 
regulating acute thermogenesis in BAT.
