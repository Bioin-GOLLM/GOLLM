Activating AMPK or inactivating calcineurin slows ageing in Caenorhabditis 
elegans and both have been implicated as therapeutic targets for age-related 
pathology in mammals. However, the direct targets that mediate their effects on 
longevity remain unclear. In mammals, CREB-regulated transcriptional 
coactivators (CRTCs) are a family of cofactors involved in diverse physiological 
processes including energy homeostasis, cancer and endoplasmic reticulum stress. 
Here we show that both AMPK and calcineurin modulate longevity exclusively 
through post-translational modification of CRTC-1, the sole C. elegans CRTC. We 
demonstrate that CRTC-1 is a direct AMPK target, and interacts with the CREB 
homologue-1 (CRH-1) transcription factor in vivo. The pro-longevity effects of 
activating AMPK or deactivating calcineurin decrease CRTC-1 and CRH-1 activity 
and induce transcriptional responses similar to those of CRH-1 null worms. 
Downregulation of crtc-1 increases lifespan in a crh-1-dependent manner and 
directly reducing crh-1 expression increases longevity, substantiating a role 
for CRTCs and CREB in ageing. Together, these findings indicate a novel role for 
CRTCs and CREB in determining lifespan downstream of AMPK and calcineurin, and 
illustrate the molecular mechanisms by which an evolutionarily conserved pathway 
responds to low energy to increase longevity.
