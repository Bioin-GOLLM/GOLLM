Mutations in ACTA1 cause a group of myopathies with expanding clinical and 
histopathological heterogeneity. We describe three patients with severe 
ACTA1-related myopathy who have muscle fiber cytoplasmic bodies but no classic 
nemaline rods. Patient 1 is a five-year-old boy who presented at birth with 
severe weakness and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Whole 
exome sequencing identified a heterozygous c.282C>A (p.Asn94Lys) ACTA1 mutation. 
Patients 2 and 3 were twin boys with hypotonia, severe weakness, and respiratory 
insufficiency at birth requiring mechanical ventilation. Both died at 6 months 
of age. The same heterozygous c.282C>A (p.Asn94Lys) ACTA1 mutation was 
identified by whole exome sequencing. We conclude that clinically severe 
ACTA1-related myopathy can present with muscle morphological findings suggestive 
of cytoplasmic body myopathy in the absence of definite nemaline rods. The 
Asn94Lys mutation in skeletal muscle sarcomeric α-actin may be linked to this 
histological appearance. These novel ACTA1 cases also illustrate the successful 
application of whole exome sequencing in directly arriving at a candidate 
genetic diagnosis in patients with unexpected phenotypic and histologic features 
for a known neuromuscular gene.
