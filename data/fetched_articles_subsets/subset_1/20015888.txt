BACKGROUND: Familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a fatal disease 
characterized by immune dysregulation from defective function of cytotoxic 
lymphocytes. Three causative genes have been identified for this autosomal 
recessive disorder (PRF1, UNC13D, and STX11). We investigated the molecular 
genetics of familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in Korea.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Pediatric patients who fulfilled the HLH-2004 criteria were 
recruited from the Korean Registry for Histiocytosis. Molecular genetic studies 
were performed on the patients' DNA samples by direct sequencing of all coding 
exons and flanking sequences of PRF1, UNC13D, and STX11.
RESULTS: Forty patients were studied and familial hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis mutations were identified in nine; eight patients had UNC13D 
mutations (89%) and one had a mutation in PRF1. No patient had a STX11 mutation. 
Notably, four patients had only one UNC13D mutant allele, suggesting that the 
other mutation was missed by conventional direct sequencing. All UNC13D 
mutations were deleterious in nature. One known splicing mutation, c.754-1G>C, 
was recurrent, accounting for 58% of all the mutant alleles (7/12). Five UNC13D 
mutations were novel (p.Gln98X, p.Glu565SerfsX7, c.1993-2A>G, c.2367+1G>A, and 
c.2954+5G>A). The one patient with PRF1 mutation was homozygous for a frameshift 
mutation (p.Leu364GlufsX93), which was previously reported to be the most 
frequent PRF1 mutation in Japan.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first investigation on the molecular genetics of 
familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in Korea. The data showed that 
UNC13D is the predominant causative gene in the Korean population. The 
identification of mutations missed by conventional sequencing would better 
delineate the mutation spectrum and help to establish the optimal molecular 
diagnostic strategy for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in Korea, 
which might need an RNA-based screening strategy.
