CCL2 is a chemokine known to recruit monocytes and macrophages to sites of 
inflammation. A growing body of research suggests CCL2 is progressively 
overexpressed in tumor beds and may play a role in the clinical progression of 
solid tumors. Cancer cells derived from several solid tumor types demonstrate 
functional receptors for CCL2, suggesting this chemokine may achieve 
tumorigenicity through direct effects on malignant cells; however, a variety of 
normal host cells that co-exist with cancer in the tumor microenvironment also 
respond to CCL2. These cells include macrophages, osteoclasts, endothelial 
cells, T-lymphocytes, and myeloid-derived immune suppressor cells (MDSCs). CCL2 
mediated interactions between normal and malignant cells in the tumor 
microenvironment and plays a multi-faceted role in tumor progression.
