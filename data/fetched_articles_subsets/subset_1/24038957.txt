One late infantile variant of the neurodegenerative disease neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinosis (NCL) is caused by a mutation in the CLN5 gene. CLN5 encodes a 
lysosomal glycoprotein whose structure and function have not yet been clearly 
defined. In the present study, we used epitope-tagged CLN5 to determine the 
topology and solubility of the CLN5 protein. Our results indicated that CLN5 is 
synthesized as a type II transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein with a cytoplasmic 
N-terminus, one TM segment, and a large luminal C-terminal domain containing an 
amphipathic helix (AH). The cytoplasmic and TM domains were rapidly removed 
following signal-peptide cleavage, and the resulting mature CLN5 was tightly 
associated with the lumen of the membrane through the AH. CLN5 pathological 
mutants deprived of AH lose their membrane association, are retained in the 
endoplasmic reticulum, and are rapidly degraded by the proteasomal machinery. We 
experimentally define the topology of CLN5 and demonstrate the existence of an 
AH that anchors the protein to the membrane. Our work sheds light on the basic 
properties of CLN5 required to better understand its biological functions and 
involvement in NCL pathogenesis.
