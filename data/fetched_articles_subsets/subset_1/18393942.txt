In eukaryotes, ORC (origin recognition complex), a six-protein complex, is the 
most likely initiator of chromosomal DNA replication. ORC belongs to the AAA(+) 
(ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) family of proteins 
and has intrinsic ATPase activity derived from Orc1p, one of its subunits. To 
reveal the role of this ATPase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's 
yeast) ORC, we mutated the Orc1p sensor 1 and sensor 2 regions, which are 
important for ATPase activity in AAA(+) proteins. Plasmid-shuffling analysis 
revealed that Asn(600), Arg(694) and Arg(704) are essential for the function of 
Orc1p. In yeast cells, overexpression of Orc1R694Ep inhibited growth, caused 
inefficient loading of MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance complex of proteins) and 
slowed the progression of S phase. In vitro, purified ORC-1R [ORC with 
Orc1R694Ep (Orc1p Arg(694)-->Glu mutant)] has decreased ATPase activity in the 
presence or absence of origin DNA. However, other activities (ATP binding and 
origin DNA binding) were indistinguishable from those of wild-type ORC. The 
present study showed that Arg(694) of the Orc1p subunit is important for the 
ATPase activity of ORC and suggests that this ATPase activity is required for 
efficient MCM loading on to origin DNA and for progression of S phase.
