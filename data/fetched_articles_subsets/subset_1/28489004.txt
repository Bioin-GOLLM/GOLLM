Neocortical basal radial glia (bRG) and cerebellar Bergmann glia (BG) are basal 
progenitors derived from ventricular apical radial glia (aRG) that selectively 
lose their apical processes. bRG and BG have been implicated in the expansion 
and folding of the cerebrum and cerebellum, respectively. Here, we analyzed the 
molecular characteristics and development of bRG and BG. Transcriptomic 
comparison revealed striking similarity of the molecular features of bRG and BG. 
We found that heightened ERK signaling activity in aRG is tightly linked to the 
temporal formation and the relative abundance of bRG in human and mouse 
cortices. Forced activation of an FGF-ERK-ETV axis that is crucial to BG 
induction specifically induced bRG with canonical human bRG features in mice. 
Therefore, our data point to a common mechanism of bRG and BG generation, 
bearing implications to the role for these basal progenitors in the evolution of 
cortical folding of the cerebrum and cerebellum.
