ERBB2 (HER2) is a gene in humans that encodes the ERBB2 protein, a member of the 
epidermal growth factor receptor family. Non-small cell lung carcinomas do not 
commonly harbour ERBB2 mutations, with clinical trials conducted to assess for 
targeted response and progression-free survival. We retrieved cases of lung 
adenocarcinoma with next-generation sequencing proven ERBB2 point mutations 
(n=8) or amplifications (n=11) and assessed the concordance of commercially 
available ERBB2 (HER2) immunohistochemical antibodies with the next-generation 
sequencing result. At present, no commercially available ERBB2 clone can 
accurately detect ERBB2 mutations consistently in non-small cell lung carcinoma 
specimens, but amplifications can be detected with reasonable diagnostic 
accuracy.
