The title compound, [Cu(C7H3NO4)(C5H6N2)(C3H7NO] n , is an amino-function-alized 
chiral metal-organic framework with (10,3)-a topology. It has been constructed 
via the assembly of the achiral triconnected pyridine-3,5-di-carboxyl-ate 
(3,5-PDC) building block and a triconnected Cu(II) atom. Each Cu(II) ion is 
coordinated by two O atoms and one N atom, respectively, of three 
crystallographically independent 3,5-PDC ligands. The square-pyramidal (CuN2O3) 
coordination geometry of the Cu(II) ion is completed by an N atom of a terminal 
4-amino-pyridine (4-APY) ligand and the O atom of a terminal 
N,N-di-methyl-formamide (DMF) ligand to give a triconnected 'T'-shaped secondary 
building unit, which becomes trigonal in the resulting (10,3)-a topology. In the 
three-dimensional structure, weak N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds are observed in which the 
donor N-H groups are provided by the 4-APY ligands and the acceptor O atoms are 
provided by the non-coordinating carboxylate O atoms of the 3,5-PDC ligands.
