Rho family small GTPases (Rho) regulate various cell motility processes by 
spatiotemporally controlling the actin cytoskeleton. Some Rho-specific guanine 
nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) are regulated via tyrosine phosphorylation 
by Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK). We also previously reported that PLEKHG2, a 
RhoGEF for the GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, is tyrosine-phosphorylated by SRC. 
However, the details of the mechanisms by which SFK regulates RhoGEFs are not 
well understood. In this study, we found for the first time that PLEKHG1, which 
has very high homology to the Dbl and pleckstrin homology domains of PLEKHG2, 
activates Cdc42 following activation by FYN, a member of the SFK family. We also 
show that this activation of PLEKHG1 by FYN requires interaction between these 
two proteins and FYN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG1. We also found 
that the region containing the Src homology 3 and Src homology 2 domains of FYN 
is required for this interaction. Finally, we demonstrated that tyrosine 
phosphorylation of Tyr-720 and Tyr-801 in PLEKHG1 is important for the 
activation of PLEKHG1. These results suggest that FYN is a regulator of PLEKHG1 
and may regulate cell morphology through Rho signaling via the interaction with 
and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLEKHG1.
