The dominant cone-rod dystrophy gene CORD6 has previously been mapped to within 
an 8 cM interval on chromosome 17p12-p13. The retinal-specific guanylate cyclase 
gene (RETGC-1), which maps to within this genetic interval and previously was 
implicated in Leber's congenital amaurosis, was screened for mutations within 
this family and in a panel of small families and individuals with various cone 
and cone- rod dystrophy phenotypes. A missense mutation (E837D) was identified 
in affected members of the CORD6 family, as well as a second missense mutation 
(R838C) in three other families with dominant cone-rod dystrophy. RETGC-1 is 
only the fourth gene to be implicated in cone-rod dystrophy and this is the 
first report of dominant mutations in this gene.
