BACKGROUND: Mutant alleles of TMPRSS3 are associated with nonsyndromic recessive 
deafness (DFNB8/B10). TMPRSS3 encodes a predicted secreted serine protease, 
although the deduced amino acid sequence has no signal peptide. In this study, 
we searched for mutant alleles of TMPRSS3 in families from Pakistan and 
Newfoundland with recessive deafness co-segregating with DFNB8/B10 linked 
haplotypes and also more thoroughly characterized the genomic structure of 
TMPRSS3.
METHODS: We enrolled families segregating recessive hearing loss from Pakistan 
and Newfoundland. Microsatellite markers flanking the TMPRSS3 locus were used 
for linkage analysis. DNA samples from participating individuals were sequenced 
for TMPRSS3. The structure of TMPRSS3 was characterized bioinformatically and 
experimentally by sequencing novel cDNA clones of TMPRSS3.
RESULTS: We identified mutations in TMPRSS3 in four Pakistani families with 
recessive, nonsyndromic congenital deafness. We also identified two recessive 
mutations, one of which is novel, of TMPRSS3 segregating in a six-generation 
extended family from Newfoundland. The spectrum of TMPRSS3 mutations is reviewed 
in the context of a genotype-phenotype correlation. Our study also revealed a 
longer isoform of TMPRSS3 with a hitherto unidentified exon encoding a signal 
peptide, which is expressed in several tissues.
CONCLUSION: Mutations of TMPRSS3 contribute to hearing loss in many communities 
worldwide and account for 1.8% (8 of 449) of Pakistani families segregating 
congenital deafness as an autosomal recessive trait. The newly identified 
TMPRSS3 isoform e will be helpful in the functional characterization of the full 
length protein.
