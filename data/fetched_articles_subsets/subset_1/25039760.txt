We present a case of a patient whose L1CAM gene in X-chromosome has a C924T 
transition. Her first son's ventriculomegaly was prenatally detected. A mature 
infant was born, his head circumference was large, and thumbs were bilaterally 
adducted. X-linked hydrocephalus (XLH) was suspected. The DNA examination 
revealed that both her and boy's LICAM gene had a C924T transition. She became 
pregnant 5 years later and amniocentesis was performed. The results of 
cytogenetic analysis revealed that the fetus was female. She continued her 
pregnancy and delivered a healthy girl. She again became pregnant 3 years later. 
The chromosomal analysis revealed that the fetus was male. Fetal DNA analysis 
determined that the fetus had the inherited mutation. She chose to terminate the 
pregnancy. A C924T mutation can be disease causing for XLH, and the detection of 
this mutation would aid in genetic counseling for the prenatal diagnosis of XLH.
