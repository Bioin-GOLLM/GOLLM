Telomere biology disorders (TBDs) are a spectrum of multisystem inherited 
disorders characterized by bone marrow failure, resulting from mutations in the 
genes encoding telomerase or other proteins involved in maintaining telomere 
length and integrity. Pathogenicity of variants in these genes can be hard to 
evaluate, because TBD mutations show highly variable penetrance and genetic 
anticipation related to inheritance of shorter telomeres with each generation. 
Thus, detailed functional analysis of newly identified variants is often 
essential. Herein, we describe a patient with compound heterozygous variants in 
the TERT gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT. This 
patient had the extremely severe Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson form of TBD, although his 
heterozygous parents were clinically unaffected. Molecular dynamic modeling and 
detailed biochemical analyses demonstrate that one allele (L557P) affects 
association of hTERT with its cognate RNA component hTR, whereas the other 
(K1050E) affects the binding of telomerase to its DNA substrate and enzyme 
processivity. Unexpectedly, the data demonstrate a functional interaction 
between the proteins encoded by the two alleles, with wild-type hTERT rescuing 
the effect of K1050E on processivity, whereas L557P hTERT does not. These data 
contribute to the mechanistic understanding of telomerase, indicating that RNA 
binding in one hTERT molecule affects the processivity of telomere addition by 
the other molecule. This work emphasizes the importance of functional 
characterization of TERT variants to reach a definitive molecular diagnosis for 
patients with TBD, and, in particular, it illustrates the importance of 
analyzing the effects of compound heterozygous variants in combination, to 
reveal interallelic effects.
