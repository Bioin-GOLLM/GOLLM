Motile cilia are hair-like structures that move and propel fluid, playing 
important roles in the physiology of organs. Here, we present a protocol to 
visualize and measure ciliary beating and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the 
telencephalon of an adult zebrafish brain explant. We describe the preparation 
of brain explants, the recording of ciliary beating and CSF flow, and data 
analysis using ImageJ and MATLAB. These imaging and analysis techniques can be 
directly translated to other ciliated systems. For complete details on the use 
and execution of this protocol, please refer to D'Gama et al. (2021).
