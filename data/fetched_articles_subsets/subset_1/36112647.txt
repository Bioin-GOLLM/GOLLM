T cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) plays a central role in stress granule 
(SG) formation by self-assembly via the prion-like domain (PLD). In the TIA-1 
PLD, amino acid mutations associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Welander distal myopathy (WDM), have been 
identified. However, how these mutations affect PLD self-assembly properties has 
remained elusive. In this study, we uncovered the implicit pathogenic structures 
caused by the mutations. NMR analysis indicated that the dynamic structures of 
the PLD are synergistically determined by the physicochemical properties of 
amino acids in units of five residues. Molecular dynamics simulations and 
three-dimensional electron crystallography, together with biochemical assays, 
revealed that the WDM mutation E384K attenuated the sticky properties, whereas 
the ALS mutations P362L and A381T enhanced the self-assembly by inducing Î²-sheet 
interactions and highly condensed assembly, respectively. These results suggest 
that the P362L and A381T mutations increase the likelihood of irreversible 
amyloid fibrillization after phase-separated droplet formation, and this process 
may lead to pathogenicity.
