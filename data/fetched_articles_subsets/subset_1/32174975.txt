The RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 12 homolog (MED12) is a member of 
the mediator complex, which plays a critical role in RNA transcription. 
Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked intellectual disability and other anomalies 
collectively grouped as MED12-related disorders. While MED12 mutations have been 
most commonly reported in male patients, we present the case of a 1-year-old 
girl with clinical characteristics similar to MED12-related disorders. To 
explore the clinical characteristics of the condition and its possible 
pathogenesis, we analyzed the patient's clinical data; genetic testing by 
whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation (c.1249-1G > C) 
in MED12. Further cDNA experiments revealed that the patient had an abnormal 
splicing at the skipping of exon9, which may have produced a truncated protein. 
qPCR showed decreased MED12 gene expression level in the patient, and an 
X-chromosome inactivation test confirmed a skewed inactivation of the 
X-chromosome. The lymphoblast transcription levels of the genes involved in the 
Gli3-dependent sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, namely, CREB5, BMP4, and 
NEUROG2, were found to be significantly elevated compared with those of her 
parents and sex- and age-matched controls. Our results support the view that 
MED12 mutations may dysregulate the SHH signaling pathway, which may have 
accounted for the aberrant craniofacial morphology of our patient.
