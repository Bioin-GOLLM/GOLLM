A practical procedure for 11CN-labeling of unprotected peptides has been 
developed. The method was shown to be highly chemoselective for cysteine over 
other potentially nucleophilic residues, and the radiolabeled products were 
synthesized and purified in less than 15 min. Appropriate for biomedical 
applications, the method could be used on an extremely small scale (20 nmol) 
with a high radiochemical yield. The success of the protocol stems from the use 
of a Pd-reagent based on a dihaloarene, which enables direct 
"nucleophile-nucleophile" coupling of the peptide and [11C]cyanide by temporal 
separation of nucleophile addition.
