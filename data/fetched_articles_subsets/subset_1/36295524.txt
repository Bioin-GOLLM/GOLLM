Background and objectives: Vortioxetine (VRT) is a relatively new selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant and serotonin receptor 
modulator, approved for the treatment of major depression and generalized 
anxiety disorder. Depression has been linked with psychomotor disengagement, 
oxidative stress burden and decreased blood levels of brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor (BDNF). In our study we performed the experimental investigation of VRT, 
magnesium and of their association on the rats' endurance capacity, motor 
behavior and blood biological disturbances in rats subjected to forced exercise 
in treadmill test. Materials and Methods: The substances were administered 
orally for 14 consecutive days, as follows: group 1 (control): distilled water 
0.3 mL/100 g body; group 2 (Mg): magnesium chloride 200 mg/kg body; group 3 
(VRT): VRT 20 mg/kg body; group 4 (VRT+Mg): VRT 20 mg/kg body + magnesium 
chloride 200 mg/kg body. Magnesium was used as positive control substance with 
known effects in treadmill test. The consequences of VRT treatment on glucose, 
cortisol, BDNF and oxidative stress biomarkers (superoxide-dismutase, 
malondialdehyde, glutathione-peroxidase, lactate dehydrogenase) were also 
assessed. Results and conclusions: The use of VRT resulted in an improvement in 
motor capacity and an increase of the rats' endurance to physical effort. The 
administration of VRT increased the serum BDNF levels and reduced the oxidative 
stress in rats subjected to physical effort. The association of magnesium 
potentiated the effects of VRT on physical performances, the antioxidant 
activity and the decreasing in serum stress markers in treadmill test in rats.
