While large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to various 
tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations. Augmenting LLMs with 
domain-specific tools such as database utilities can facilitate easier and more 
precise access to specialized knowledge. In this paper, we present GeneGPT, a 
novel method for teaching LLMs to use the Web APIs of the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for answering genomics questions. Specifically, 
we prompt Codex to solve the GeneTuring tests with NCBI Web APIs by in-context 
learning and an augmented decoding algorithm that can detect and execute API 
calls. Experimental results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art 
performance on eight tasks in the GeneTuring benchmark with an average score of 
0.83, largely surpassing retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the new Bing (0.44), 
biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as GPT-3 
(0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12). Our further analyses suggest that: (1) API 
demonstrations have good cross-task generalizability and are more useful than 
documentations for in-context learning; (2) GeneGPT can generalize to longer 
chains of API calls and answer multi-hop questions in GeneHop, a novel dataset 
introduced in this work; (3) Different types of errors are enriched in different 
tasks, providing valuable insights for future improvements.
