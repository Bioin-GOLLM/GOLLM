Current data indicates that anti-tumor T cell-mediated immunity correlates with 
a better prognosis in cancer patients. However, it has widely been demonstrated 
that tumor cells negatively manage immune attack by activating several 
immune-suppressive mechanisms. It is, therefore, essential to fully understand 
how lymphocytes are activated in a tumor microenvironment and, above all, how to 
prevent these cells from becoming dysfunctional. Tumors produce galectins-1, -3, 
-7, -8, and -9 as one of the major molecular mechanisms to evade immune control 
of tumor development. These galectins impact different steps in the 
establishment of the anti-tumor immune responses. Here, we carry out a critical 
dissection on the mechanisms through which tumor-derived galectins can influence 
the production and the functionality of anti-tumor T lymphocytes. This knowledge 
may help us design more effective immunotherapies to treat human cancers.
