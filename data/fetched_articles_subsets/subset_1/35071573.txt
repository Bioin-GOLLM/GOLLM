BACKGROUND: The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized 
the management of several types of solid cancers, including lung cancer, by 
boosting the body's natural tumor killing response. However, it is undeniable 
that only a small proportion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations can achieve long-term 
responses and benefit from immunotherapy.
CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we report the case of a 48-year-old man diagnosed with 
stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with an EGFR L858R mutation who was administered 
pembrolizumab monotherapy followed by pemetrexed and achieved a 10-month 
progression-free survival interval. In this case report, we show that ICIs were 
effective for our patient with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and discuss the 
characteristics of patients who can benefit from immunotherapy.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC with high PD-L1 
expression (defined as ≥ 25%), the L858R mutation, smoking history, or 
pemetrexed pretreatment may benefit from immunotherapy.
