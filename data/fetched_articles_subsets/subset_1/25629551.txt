Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) is 
regulated by a myriad of signaling cascades including glycogen synthase kinase 
(GSK) 3β and plays a Janus role in podocyte injury. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) or adriamycin (ADR) elicited podocyte injury and cytoskeletal disruption, 
associated with NFκB activation and induced expression of NFκB target molecules, 
including pro-survival Bcl-xL and podocytopathic mediators like MCP-1, cathepsin 
L, and B7-1. Broad-range inhibition of NFκB diminished the expression of all 
NFκB target genes, restored cytoskeleton integrity, but potentiated apoptosis. 
In contrast, blockade of GSK3β by lithium or 
4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8) mitigated the 
expression of podocytopathic mediators, ameliorated podocyte injury, but barely 
affected Bcl-xL expression or sensitized apoptosis. Mechanistically, GSK3β was 
sufficient and essential for RelA/p65 phosphorylation, specifically at serine 
467, which specifies the expression of selective NFκB target molecules, 
including podocytopathic mediators, but not Bcl-xL. In vivo, lithium or TDZD-8 
therapy improved podocyte injury and proteinuria in mice treated with LPS or 
ADR, concomitant with the suppression of podocytopathic mediators, but retained 
Bcl-xL in glomerulus. Broad-range inhibition of NFκB conferred similar but much 
weakened antiproteinuric and podoprotective effects accompanied with a blunted 
glomerular expression of Bcl-xL and marked podocyte apoptosis. Thus, the 
GSK3β-dictated fine-tuning of NFκB may serve as a novel therapeutic target for 
podocytopathy.
