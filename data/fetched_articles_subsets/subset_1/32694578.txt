Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the related families of disintegrin 
metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and ADAMs with thrombospondin repeats (ADAMTSs) play 
a crucial role in extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and shedding of 
cell-surface molecules. The proteolytic activity of metalloproteinases is 
post-translationally regulated by their endogenous inhibitors, known as tissue 
inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Several MMPs, ADAMTSs and TIMPs have 
been reported to be endocytosed by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein-1 (LRP-1). Different binding affinities of these proteins for the 
endocytic receptor correlate with different turnover rates which, together with 
differences in their mRNA expression, determines their nett extracellular 
levels. In this study, we used surface plasmon resonance to evaluate the 
affinity between LRP-1 and a number of MMPs, ADAMs, ADAMTSs, TIMPs and 
metalloproteinase/TIMP complexes. This identified MMP-1 as a new LRP-1 ligand. 
Among the proteins analyzed, TIMP-3 bound to LRP-1 with highest affinity 
(KD = 1.68 nM). Additionally, we found that TIMP-3 can facilitate the clearance 
of its target metalloproteinases by bridging their binding to LRP-1. For 
example, the free form of MMP-1 was found to have a KD of 34.6 nM for LRP-1, 
while the MMP-1/TIMP-3 complex had a sevenfold higher affinity (KD = 4.96 nM) 
for the receptor. TIMP-3 similarly bridged binding of MMP-13 and MMP-14 to 
LRP-1. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were also found to increase the affinity of target 
metalloproteinases for LRP-1, albeit to a lesser extent. This suggests that 
LRP-1 scavenging of TIMP/metalloproteinase complexes may be a general mechanism 
by which inhibited metalloproteinases are removed from the extracellular 
environment.
