Neuromodulators adapt sensory circuits to changes in the external world or the 
animal's internal state and synapses are key control sites for such plasticity. 
Less clear is how neuromodulation alters the amount of information transmitted 
through the circuit. We investigated this question in the context of the diurnal 
regulation of visual processing in the retina of zebrafish, focusing on ribbon 
synapses of bipolar cells. We demonstrate that contrast-sensitivity peaks in the 
afternoon accompanied by a four-fold increase in the average Shannon information 
transmitted from an active zone. This increase reflects higher synaptic gain, 
lower spontaneous "noise" and reduced variability of evoked responses. 
Simultaneously, an increase in the probability of multivesicular events with 
larger information content increases the efficiency of transmission (bits per 
vesicle) by factors of 1.5-2.7. This study demonstrates the multiplicity of 
mechanisms by which a neuromodulator can adjust the synaptic transfer of sensory 
information.
