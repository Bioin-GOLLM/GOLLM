OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the genetic polymorphisms of 
the six transmembrane protein of prostate 2 gene (STAMP2) and essential 
hypertension in Xinjiang Uygur population.
METHODS: The sequences of STAMP2 gene functional region were sequenced in 
Xinjiang Uygur population with hypertension. The representative variations 
selected were genotyped by TaqMan-PCR method in 2047 Uygur individuals, 
including 810 patients with hypertension and 1237 healthy subjects. The 
association of the genetic variations of the STAMP2 gene with hypertension in 
Uygur was analyzed.
RESULTS: In the three representative variations (rs8122, rs1981529 and 
rs34741656) genotyped, there were no significant differences in genotype 
distribution and allele frequencies between the essential hypertension and 
control groups (P > 0.05). In ANCOVA analysis, none of the polymorphisms was 
significantly associated with systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood 
pressure (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences in haplotype 
frequencies between the two groups either(P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: There was no association of the three polymorphisms (rs8122, 
rs1981529 and rs34741656) in the STAMP2 gene with essential hypertension in 
Xinjiang Uygur population.
