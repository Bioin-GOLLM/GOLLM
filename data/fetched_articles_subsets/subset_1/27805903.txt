The Hippo signalling pathway regulates cellular proliferation, apoptosis and 
differentiation, thus exerting profound effects on cellular homeostasis. 
Inhibition of Hippo signalling has been frequently implicated in human cancers, 
indicating a well-known tumour suppressor function of the Hippo pathway. 
However, it is less certain whether and how hyperactivation of the Hippo pathway 
affects biological outcome in living cells. This review describes current 
knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of the Hippo pathway, mainly focusing on 
hyperactivation of the Hippo signalling nexus. The disease implications of 
hyperactivated Hippo signalling have also been discussed, including 
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy, Alzheimer's 
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetes. By highlighting the 
significance of disease-relevant Hippo signalling activation, this review can 
offer exciting prospects to address the onset and potential reversal of 
Hippo-related disorders.
