The study of epigenomics has advanced in recent years to span the regulation of 
a single genetic locus to the structure and orientation of entire chromosomes 
within the nucleus. In this review, we focus on the challenges and opportunities 
of clinical epigenomics in cardiovascular disease. As an integrator of genetic 
and environmental inputs, and because of advances in measurement techniques that 
are highly reproducible and provide sequence information, the epigenome is a 
rich source of potential biosignatures of cardiovascular health and disease. 
Most of the studies to date have focused on the latter, and herein we discuss 
observations on epigenomic changes in human cardiovascular disease, examining 
the role of protein modifiers of chromatin, noncoding RNAs and DNA modification. 
We provide an overview of cardiovascular epigenomics, discussing the challenges 
of data sovereignty, data analysis, doctor-patient ethics and innovations 
necessary to implement precision health.
