The increasing complexity and diversity of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 
(HIV-1) infections challenge the disease control and anti-retrovirus treatment 
in China. The infection stages and molecular characteristics of HIV-1 from 
infected Chinese blood donors were examined to shed light on the HIV genotype 
distribution and the status of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in the changing 
HIV epidemic in China. Western blot (WB) confirmed HIV-1 positive plasma samples 
were collected from blood donors at five Chinese blood centers from April 16, 
2012, through June 30, 2014. The HIV infection stages were determined using the 
Lag-avidity assay. HIV Pol regions including whole protease and partial reverse 
transcriptase (RT) were amplified and sequenced to establish the profile of 
genotype distribution and drug resistance mutations (DRMs). Viral loads were 
determined using the ROCHE COBAS system. Of the 259 HIV-1 positive samples 
tested by the Lag-avidity assay, 23.6% (61/259) were identified as recent 
infections. A total of 205 amplified sequences displayed the following genotype 
distributions: circulating recombinant form (CRF) 07_BC (61.5%), CRF08_BC 
(8.3%), CRF01_AE (20%), B (6.3%), and 01B (3.9%). There was no significant 
difference in genotype distribution between recent and long-term infections. 31 
DRMs were identified from 27 samples including four protease inhibitors (PIs) 
accessory DRMs, two PIs major DRMs (M46I), two nucleoside RT inhibitors DRMs 
(K219R and K70Q), and 23 nonnucleoside RT inhibitors DRMs. 27 samples had DRMs, 
yielding a drug resistance prevalence of 13.2% (27/205). Our findings provide 
important information for developing strategies for comprehensive HIV control 
and improving anti-retroviral treatment in China.
