The ubiquitin pathway regulates the function of many proteins and controls 
cellular protein homeostasis. In recent years, it has attracted great interest 
in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we have presented 
the first review on the roles of the 9 proteins of the HECT E3 ligase NEDD4 
subfamily in the development and function of neurons in the central nervous 
system (CNS). We discussed their regulation and their direct or indirect 
involvement in neurodevelopmental diseases, such as intellectual disability, and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Further studies on the roles of these proteins, 
their regulation and their targets in neurons will certainly contribute to a 
better understanding of neuronal function and dysfunction, and will also provide 
interesting information for the development of therapeutics targeting them.
