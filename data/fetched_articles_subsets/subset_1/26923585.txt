Glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification that underlies 
many biological processes and diseases. α-dystroglycan (α-DG) is a receptor for 
matrix and synaptic proteins that causes muscular dystrophy and lissencephaly 
upon its abnormal glycosylation (α-dystroglycanopathies). Here we identify the 
glycan unit ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P), a phosphoric ester of pentose alcohol, 
in α-DG. Rbo5P forms a tandem repeat and functions as a scaffold for the 
formation of the ligand-binding moiety. We show that enzyme activities of three 
major α-dystroglycanopathy-causing proteins are involved in the synthesis of 
tandem Rbo5P. Isoprenoid synthase domain-containing (ISPD) is cytidine 
diphosphate ribitol (CDP-Rbo) synthase. Fukutin and fukutin-related protein are 
sequentially acting Rbo5P transferases that use CDP-Rbo. Consequently, Rbo5P 
glycosylation is defective in α-dystroglycanopathy models. Supplementation of 
CDP-Rbo to ISPD-deficient cells restored α-DG glycosylation. These findings 
establish the molecular basis of mammalian Rbo5P glycosylation and provide 
insight into pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies in α-DG-associated 
diseases.
