The number of SARS-CoV-2 spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with multiple amino 
acid mutations is huge due to random mutations and combinatorial explosions, 
making it almost impossible to experimentally determine their binding affinities 
to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). Although computational 
prediction is an alternative way, there is still no online platform to predict 
the mutation effect of RBD on the hACE2 binding affinity until now. In this 
study, we developed a free online platform based on deep learning models, namely 
D3AI-Spike, for quickly predicting binding affinity between spike RBD mutants 
and hACE2. The models based on CNN and CNN-RNN methods have the concordance 
index of around 0.8. Overall, the test results of the models are in agreement 
with the experimental data. To further evaluate the prediction power of 
D3AI-Spike, we predicted and experimentally determined the binding affinity of a 
VUM (variants under monitoring) variant IHU (B.1.640.2), which has fourteen 
amino acid substitutions, including N501Y and E484K, and 9 deletions located in 
the spike protein. The predicted average affinity score for wild-type RBD and 
IHU to hACE2 are 0.483 and 0.438, while the determined Kaff values are 
5.39 ± 0.38 × 107 L/mol and 1.02 ± 0.47 × 107 L/mol, respectively, demonstrating 
the strong predictive power of D3AI-Spike. We think D3AI-Spike will be helpful 
to the viral transmission prediction for the new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
