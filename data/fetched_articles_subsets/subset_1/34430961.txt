Achondroplasia (ACH) is a hereditary disorder of dwarfism that is caused by the 
aberrant proliferation and differentiation of chondrocyte growth plates. The 
common findings of macrocephaly and facial anomalies accompany dwarfism in these 
patients. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 ( FGFR3 ) gene mutations are 
common causes of achondroplasia. The current study presents a case of 2-year-old 
male child patient presenting with phenotypic characteristics of ACH. The 
interesting finding of the case is the presence of psychomotor delay that is not 
very common in these patients. Clinical exome sequencing analyzing 4.813 disease 
causing genes revealed a de novo c.1138G > A mutation within the FGFR3 gene. In 
conclusion, the mutation confirms the clinical diagnosis of ACH, and it seems to 
be causing the psychomotor delay in this patient.
