In this project, a highly precise quantitative method based on the digital 
polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) technique was developed to determine the weight 
of pork and chicken in meat products. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR) is currently used for quantitative molecular analysis of the 
presence of species-specific DNAs in meat products. However, it is limited in 
amplification efficiency and relies on standard curves based Ct values, 
detecting and quantifying low copy number target DNA, as in some complex mixture 
meat products. By using the dPCR method, we find the relationships between the 
raw meat weight and DNA weight and between the DNA weight and DNA copy number 
were both close to linear. This enabled us to establish formulae to calculate 
the raw meat weight based on the DNA copy number. The accuracy and applicability 
of this method were tested and verified using samples of pork and chicken powder 
mixed in known proportions. Quantitative analysis indicated that dPCR is highly 
precise in quantifying pork and chicken in meat products and therefore has the 
potential to be used in routine analysis by government regulators and quality 
control departments of commercial food and feed enterprises.
