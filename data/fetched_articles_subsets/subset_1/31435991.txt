Glutamine dependence is a unique metabolic defect seen in cutaneous melanoma 
(CM), directly influencing the treatment and prognosis. Here, we investigated 
the associations between 6025 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
77 glutamine metabolic pathway genes with CM-specific survival (CMSS) using 
genotyping datasets from two published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). 
In the single-locus analysis, 76 SNPs were found to be significantly associated 
with CMSS (P < .050, false-positive report probability < 0.2 and Bayesian false 
discovery probability < 0.8) in the discovery dataset, of which seven SNPs were 
replicated in the validation dataset and three SNPs (HAL rs17676826T > C, LGSN 
rs12663017T > A, and NOXRED1 rs8012548A > G) independently predicted CMSS, with 
an effect-allele attributed adjusted hazards ratio of 1.52 (95% confidence 
interval = 1.19-1.93) and P < .001, 0.68 (0.54-0.87) and P = .002 and 0.62 
(0.46-0.83) and P = .002, respectively. The model including the number of 
unfavorable genotypes (NUGs) of these three SNPs and covariates improved the 
five-year CMSS prediction (P = .012) than the one with other covariates only. 
Further expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis found that the LGSN 
rs12663017 A allele was significantly associated with increased messenger RNA 
(mRNA) expression levels (P = 8.89 × 10 -11 ) in lymphoblastoid cell lines of 
the 1000 Genomes Project database. In the analysis of the genotype tissue 
expression (GTEx) project datasets, HAL rs17676826 C and NOXRED1 rs8012548 G 
alleles were significantly associated with their mRNA expression levels in 
sun-exposed skin of the lower leg (P = 6.62 × 10-6 and 1.37 × 10-7 , 
respectively) and in sun-not-exposed suprapubic skin (P < .001 and 1.43 × 10-8 , 
respectively). Taken together, these genetic variants of glutamine-metabolic 
pathway genes may be promising predictors of survival in patients with CM.
