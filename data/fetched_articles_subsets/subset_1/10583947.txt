The crystal structure of a complex involving the D10 T cell receptor (TCR), 
16-residue foreign peptide antigen, and the I-Ak self major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) class II molecule is reported at 3.2 angstrom resolution. The D10 
TCR is oriented in an orthogonal mode relative to its peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligand, 
necessitated by the amino-terminal extension of peptide residues projecting from 
the MHC class II antigen-binding groove as part of a mini beta sheet. 
Consequently, the disposition of D10 complementarity-determining region loops is 
altered relative to that of most pMHCI-specific TCRs; the latter TCRs assume a 
diagonal orientation, although with substantial variability. Peptide 
recognition, which involves P-1 to P8 residues, is dominated by the Valpha 
domain, which also binds to the class II MHC beta1 helix. That docking is 
limited to one segment of MHC-bound peptide offers an explanation for epitope 
recognition and altered peptide ligand effects, suggests a structural basis for 
alloreactivity, and illustrates how bacterial superantigens can span the 
TCR-pMHCII surface.
