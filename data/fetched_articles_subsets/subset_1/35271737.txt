The structure of the genome shapes the distribution of genetic diversity and 
sequence divergence. To investigate how the relationship between chromosome size 
and recombination rate affects sequence divergence between species, we combined 
empirical analyses and evolutionary simulations. We estimated pairwise sequence 
divergence among 15 species from three different mammalian clades-Peromyscus 
rodents, Mus mice, and great apes-from chromosome-level genome assemblies. We 
found a strong significant negative correlation between chromosome size and 
sequence divergence in all species comparisons within the Peromyscus and great 
apes clades but not the Mus clade, suggesting that the dramatic chromosomal 
rearrangements among Mus species may have masked the ancestral genomic landscape 
of divergence in many comparisons. Our evolutionary simulations showed that the 
main factor determining differences in divergence among chromosomes of different 
sizes is the interplay of recombination rate and selection, with greater 
variation in larger populations than in smaller ones. In ancestral populations, 
shorter chromosomes harbor greater nucleotide diversity. As ancestral 
populations diverge, diversity present at the onset of the split contributes to 
greater sequence divergence in shorter chromosomes among daughter species. The 
combination of empirical data and evolutionary simulations revealed that 
chromosomal rearrangements, demography, and divergence times may also affect the 
relationship between chromosome size and divergence, thus deepening our 
understanding of the role of genome structure in the evolution of species 
divergence.
