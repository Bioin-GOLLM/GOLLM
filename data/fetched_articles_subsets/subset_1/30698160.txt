BACKGROUND: The significance of individual risk factors in the development of 
contact allergy, such as genetic variation in cytokine genes and atopy, is still 
not clearly defined.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
TNFα 308G>A polymorphism or atopy and contact sensitization (CS) in a cohort 
from the general Croatian population.
MATERIALS & METHODS: The study involved 312 first-year students from the 
University of Zagreb (median age: 19 years). Methods included a questionnaire 
and skin prick and patch testing for common inhalable and contact allergens, 
respectively, as well as genotyping for TNFα 308G>A polymorphism based on buccal 
swabs.
RESULTS: CS (positive patch test for ≥1 contact allergen) was reported in 32%, 
atopy (positive prick test for ≥1 inhalable allergen) in 38%, and TNFα 308G>A 
polymorphism in 23% of subjects. Based on multivariate analysis, atopy was 
confirmed as a predictor of CS, poly-sensitization, CS to p-phenylenediamine and 
cobalt chloride, and self-reported skin symptoms. TNFα 308G>A polymorphism was 
confirmed as a predictor of CS to p-phenylenediamine (OR: 5.72; 95% CI 
1.20-27.28).
CONCLUSION: These findings could be relevant for evaluation of individual 
susceptibility to developing a contact allergy, particularly among persons 
occupationally exposed to skin hazards.
