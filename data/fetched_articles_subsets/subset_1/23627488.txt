VEGF is an important mediator of tumor angiogenesis in malignant lesions in a 
genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: VEGF is one of the key drivers of physiological or pathological 
angiogenesis hence several VEGF inhibitors are in different stages of clinical 
development. To further dissect the role of VEGF in different stages of tumor 
progression in lung tumors, we utilized KrasG12D-LSL GEMMs (genetically 
engineered mouse models).
METHODS: Intranasal delivery of adenoviruses expressing cre recombinase in 
KrasG12D-LSL mice results in the expression of mutant Kras that leads to 
development of tumor lesions ranging from adenomatous hyperplasia to large 
adenoma and adenocarcinoma over time in lung. In the current study, we treated 
KrasG12D-LSL mice at 14Â weeks post inhalation with three different angiogenic 
inhibitors including axitinib and PF-00337210 both of which are selective 
inhibitors of VEGFR and sunitinib which targets VEGFR, C-SF1-R, PDGFR and KIT.
RESULTS: Pathology findings showed no significant difference in percentage of 
adenomatous hyperplastic lesions between the vehicle vs. any of the treatments 
suggesting that angiogenesis may not play a major role at early stages of 
tumorigenesis. However, each inhibitor suppressed percentage of benign adenoma 
lesions and almost fully inhibited growth of adenocarcinoma lesions in the 
recipients which was consistent with a reduction in tumor vasculature. Treatment 
with sunitinib which is a multi-targeted RTKI did not provide any advantage 
compared to selective VEGFR inhibitor further emphasizing role of VEGF in tumor 
angiogenesis in this model.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our studies indicate significance of VEGF and angiogenesis 
in a spontaneous model of lung tumorigenesis and provide a proof of mechanism 
for anti-cancer activity of VEGF inhibitors in this model.
