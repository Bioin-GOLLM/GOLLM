Withanolides are steroidal lactones widespread in Nightshade plants with often 
potent antiproliferative activities. Additionally, the structural diversity of 
this compound class holds much potential for the discovery of novel biological 
activity. Here, we report two newly characterised withanolides, named irinans, 
from Physalis peruviana with highly unusual truncated backbones that resemble 
mammalian androstane sex hormones. Based on biomimetic chemical reactions, we 
propose a model that links these compounds to withanolide biosynthesis. Irinans 
have potent antiproliferative activities, that are however lower than those of 
4ß-hydroxywithanolide E. Our work establishes androwithanolides as a new 
subclass of withanolides.
