A virtual ligand-based screening approach was designed and evaluated for the 
discovery of new A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) ligands. For comparison and 
evaluation, the procedures from a recently published virtual screening study 
that used the A(2A) AR X-ray crystal structure for the target-based discovery of 
new A(2A) ligands were largely followed. Several screening models were 
constructed by deriving the distinguishing structural features from selected 
sets of A(2A) AR antagonists, so-called frequent substructure mining. The best 
model in statistical terms was subsequently applied to large-scale virtual 
screens of a commercial vendor library. This resulted in the selection of 36 
candidates for acquisition and testing. Of the selected candidates, eight 
compounds significantly inhibited radioligand binding at A(2A) AR (>30%) at 10 
μM, corresponding to a "hit rate" of 22%. This hit rate is quite similar to that 
of the referenced target-based virtual screening study, while both approaches 
yield new, non-overlapping sets of ligands.
