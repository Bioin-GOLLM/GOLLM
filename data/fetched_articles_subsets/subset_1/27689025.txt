Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are tumor cells that are separated from the 
primary site or metastatic lesion and disseminate in blood circulation. CTCs are 
considered to be part of the long process of cancer metastasis. As a 'liquid 
biopsy', CTC molecular examination and investigation of single cancer cells 
create an important opportunity for providing an understanding of cancer biology 
and the process of metastasis. In the last decade, we have seen dramatic 
development in defining the role of CTCs in lung cancer in terms of diagnosis, 
genomic alteration determination, treatment response and, finally, prognosis 
prediction. The aims of this review are to understand the basic biology and to 
review methods of detection of CTCs that apply to the various types of solid 
tumor. Furthermore, we explored clinical applications, including treatment 
monitoring to anticipate therapy resistance as well as biomarker analysis, in 
the context of lung cancer. We also explored the potential use of cell-free 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the genomic alteration analysis of lung cancer.
