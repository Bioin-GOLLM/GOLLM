The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) consists of isolated or aggregated 
lymphoid follicles forming Peyer's patches (PPs). By their ability to transport 
luminal antigens and bacteria, PPs can be considered as the immune sensors of 
the intestine. PPs functions like induction of immune tolerance or defense 
against pathogens result from the complex interplay between immune cells located 
in the lymphoid follicles and the follicle-associated epithelium. This crosstalk 
seems to be regulated by pathogen recognition receptors, especially Nod2. 
Although TLR exerts a limited role in PP homeotasis, Nod2 regulates the number, 
size, and T-cell composition of PPs, in response to the gut flora. In turn, 
CD4(+) T-cells present in the PP are able to modulate the paracellular and 
transcellular permeabilities. Two human disorders, Crohn's disease and 
graft-versus-host disease are thought to be driven by an abnormal response 
toward the commensal flora. They have been associated with NOD2 mutations and PP 
dysfunction.
