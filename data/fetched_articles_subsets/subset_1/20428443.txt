BACKGROUND: Xba I polymorphism in the apolipoprotein (apo) B gene has often been 
studied in connection with myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and 
plasma lipid concentrations. The X2 allele (restriction site present) is often 
mentioned as a disadvantageous one. Low birth weight has also been described as 
a risk factor for hyperlipidemia.
OBJECTIVE: To study the Xba I polymorphism in the apo B gene.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Southern blot or polymerase chain reaction was used in two 
groups of children (low and high cholesterolemic, 82 and 86 children, 
respectively), selected from 2000 children with known birth weight.
RESULTS: In the subgroup of high cholesterolemic children with birth weight 
under 3.00 kg, the X1/X1 (P=0.056) genotype was found at a lower frequency. No 
similar association was shown in low cholesterolemic children.
CONCLUSION: Xba I polymorphism is in a strong linkage disequilibrium with Ala 
(591) --> Val polymorphism in apo B, which influences postprandial lipemia and 
so, possibly, intrauterine nutrition and, consequently, birth weight. These 
results suggest that, in lower birth weight probands, X1/X1 homozygosity of Xba 
I polymorphism in the apo B gene may protect against the development of 
hypercholesterolemia, at least in childhood.
