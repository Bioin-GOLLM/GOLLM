A dosing algorithm including genetic (VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes) and 
nongenetic factors (age, weight, therapeutic indication, and cotreatment with 
amiodarone or simvastatin) explained 51% of the variance in stable weekly 
warfarin doses in 390 patients attending an anticoagulant clinic in a Brazilian 
public hospital. The VKORC1 3673G>A genotype was the most important predictor of 
warfarin dose, with a partial R(2) value of 23.9%. Replacing the VKORC1 3673G>A 
genotype with VKORC1 diplotype did not increase the algorithm's predictive 
power. We suggest that three other single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
(5808T>G, 6853G>C, and 9041G>A) that are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) 
with 3673G>A would be equally good predictors of the warfarin dose requirement. 
The algorithm's predictive power was similar across the self-identified 
"race/color" subsets. "Race/color" was not associated with stable warfarin dose 
in the multiple regression model, although the required warfarin dose was 
significantly lower (P = 0.006) in white (29 +/- 13 mg/week, n = 196) than in 
black patients (35 +/- 15 mg/week, n = 76).
