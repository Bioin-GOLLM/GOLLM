Recurrence is the major death cause of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), 
and a better understanding of recurrence risk at early stage may lead to make 
the optimal medical decision to improve patients' prognosis. The 2015 American 
Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system primary based on 
clinic-pathologic features is the most commonly used to describe the initial 
risk of persistent/recurrent disease. Besides, multiple prognostics models based 
on multigenes expression profiles have been developed to predict the recurrence 
risk of DTC patients. Recent evidences indicated that aberrant DNA methylation 
is involved in the initiation and progression of DTC and can be useful 
biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and prognosis prediction of DTC. Therefore, 
there is a need for integrating gene methylation feature to assess the 
recurrence risk of DTC. Gene methylation profile from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) was used to construct a recurrence risk model of DTC by successively 
performed univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox 
regression. Two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) methylation cohorts of DTC were 
utilized to validate the predictive value of the methylation profiles model as 
external cohort by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and survival 
analysis. Besides, CCK-8, colony-formation assay, transwell, and scratch-wound 
assay were used to investigate the biological significance of critical gene in 
the model. In our study, we constructed and validated a prognostic signature 
based on methylation profiles of SPTA1, APCS, and DAB2 and constructed a 
nomogram based on the methylation-related model, age, and AJCC_T stage that 
could provide evidence for the long-term treatment and management of DTC 
patients. Besides, in vitro experiments showed that DAB2 inhibited 
proliferation, colony-formation, and migration of BCPAP cells and the gene set 
enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis showed that DAB2 may 
promote antitumor immunity in DTC. In conclusion, promoter hypermethylation and 
loss expression of DAB2 in DTC may be a biomarker of unfavorable prognosis and 
poor response to immune therapy.
