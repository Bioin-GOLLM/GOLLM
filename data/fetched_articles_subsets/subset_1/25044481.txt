Protein arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze methyl-group transfer 
from S-adenosyl-L-methionine onto arginine residues in proteins. In this study, 
modifications were introduced at the guanidine moiety of a peptidyl arginine 
residue to investigate how changes to the PRMT substrate can modulate enzyme 
activity. We found that peptides bearing Nη-hydroxy or Nη-amino substituted 
arginine showed higher apparent kcat values than for the monomethylated 
substrate when using PRMT1, whereas this catalytic preference was not observed 
for PRMT4 and PRMT6. Methylation by compromised PRMT1 variants E153Q and D51N 
further supports the finding that the N-hydroxy substitution facilitates methyl 
transfer by tuning the reactivity of the guanidine moiety. In contrast, Nη-nitro 
and Nη-canavanine substituted substrates inhibit PRMT activity. These findings 
demonstrate that methylation of these PRMT substrates is dependent on the nature 
of the modification at the guanidine moiety.
