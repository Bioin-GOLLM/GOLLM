BACKGROUND: The genes controlling long-term weight changes are largely unknown. 
The beta1 (beta1)-adrenoceptor gene contains two nonsynonomous single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), Ser49Gly and Gly389Arg, that both are functional in human 
cell lines.
DESIGN: We investigated the influence of these two SNPs on short- and long-term 
changes in body mass index (BMI) in a population-based cohort of 761 women who 
were examined during pregnancy in 1984-1985 and 15 y thereafter.
RESULTS: At entry, no genotype effect on BMI was found. After 15 y, the BMI of 
women carrying the Gly49-genotype (25.3+/-0.3 kg/m(2)) was higher (P<0.005) than 
that of Ser49-women (24.4+/-0.2 kg/m(2)). Also, the BMI-increase over 15 y was 
higher (P=0.018) in Gly49-women (3.3+/-0.2 kg/m(2)) than in Ser49-women 
(2.8+/-0.1 kg/m(2)). The odds ratio for being overweight after 15 y having the 
Gly49-genotype was 1.6 (confidence interval 1.1-2.3, P=0.01). No effect of SNP 
389 alone on BMI was found but there was a genotype-genotype interaction. Those 
carrying the Gly49-Gly389 combination increased their BMI about 0.7 kg/m(2) more 
than other combinations (P=0.025). No genotype effect on BMI changes during 
pregnancy for either SNP was found.
CONCLUSION: Polymorphism of the beta1-adrenoceptor gene influences long-term 
weight gain and the incidence of adult-onset overweight in women.
