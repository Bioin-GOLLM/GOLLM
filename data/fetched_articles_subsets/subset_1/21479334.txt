ADAMTS13 is a secreted zinc metalloprotease expressed by various cell types. 
Here, we investigate its cellular pathway in endogenously expressing liver cell 
lines and after transient transfection with ADAMTS13. Besides 
compartmentalizations of the cellular secretory system, we detected an 
appreciable level of endogenous ADAMTS13 within the nucleus. A positively 
charged amino acid cluster (R-Q-R-Q-R-Q-R-R) present in the ADAMTS13 propeptide 
may act as a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Fusing this NLS-containing 
region to eGFP greatly potentiated its nuclear localization. Bioinformatics 
analysis suggests that the ADAMTS13 CUB-2 domain has a double-stranded beta 
helix (DSBH) structural architecture characteristic of various protein-protein 
interaction modules like nucleoplasmins, class I collagenase, tumor necrosis 
factor ligand superfamily, supernatant protein factor (SPF) and the B1 domain of 
neuropilin-2. Based on this contextual evidence and that largely conserved polar 
residues could be mapped on to a template CUB domain homolog, we hypothesize 
that a region in the ADAMTS13 CUB-2 domain with conserved polar residues might 
be involved in protein-protein interaction within the nucleus.
