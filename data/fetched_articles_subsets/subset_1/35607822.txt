Anther development from stamen primordium to pollen dispersal is complex and 
essential to sexual reproduction. How this highly dynamic and complex 
developmental process is controlled genetically is not well understood, 
especially for genes involved in specific key developmental phases. Here we 
generated RNA sequencing libraries spanning 10 key stages across the entirety of 
anther development in maize (Zea mays). Global transcriptome analyses revealed 
distinct phases of cell division and expansion, meiosis, pollen maturation, and 
mature pollen, for which we detected 50, 245, 42, and 414 phase-specific marker 
genes, respectively. Phase-specific transcription factor genes were 
significantly enriched in the phase of meiosis. The phase-specific expression of 
these marker genes was highly conserved among the maize lines Chang7-2 and W23, 
indicating they might have important roles in anther development. We explored a 
desiccation-related protein gene, ZmDRP1, which was exclusively expressed in the 
tapetum from the tetrad to the uninucleate microspore stage, by generating 
knockout mutants. Notably, mutants in ZmDRP1 were completely male-sterile, with 
abnormal Ubisch bodies and defective pollen exine. Our work provides a glimpse 
into the gene expression dynamics and a valuable resource for exploring the 
roles of key phase-specific genes that regulate anther development.
