BACKGROUND: Actins are structural components of the cytoskeleton and muscle, and 
numerous actin isoforms are found in most organisms. However, many actin 
isoforms are expressed in distinct patterns allowing each actin to have a 
specialized function. Numerous studies have demonstrated that actin isoforms 
both can and cannot compensate for each other under specific circumstances. This 
allows for an ambiguity of whether isoforms are functionally distinct.
RESULTS: In this study, we analyzed mutants of Drosophila Act79B, the 
predominant actin expressed in the adult jump muscle. Functional and structural 
analysis of the Act79B mutants found the flies to have normal jumping ability 
and sarcomere structure. Analysis of actin gene expression determined that 
expression of Act88F, an actin gene normally expressed in the flight muscles, 
was significantly up-regulated in the jump muscles of mutants. This indicated 
that loss of Act79B caused expansion of Act88F expression. When we created 
double mutants of Act79B and Act88F, this abolished the jump ability of the 
flies and resulted in severe defects in myofibril formation.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Act88F can functionally substitute for 
Act79B in the jump muscle, and that the functional compensation in actin 
expression in the jump muscles only occurs through Act88F. Developmental
