BACKGROUND/AIMS: APE1 is an important DNA repair protein in the base excision 
repair pathway. Genetic variations in APE1 have been suggested to influence 
individuals' susceptibility to human malignancies. The present study was aimed 
to investigate the associations between two functional polymorphisms in APE1 
(-656T>G and 1349T>G) and breast cancer risk.
METHODS: We genotyped the two polymorphisms in a case-control study of 500 
breast cancer patients and 799 age-matched cancer-free controls using the TaqMan 
method. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounding 
factors was used to assess the associations.
RESULTS: We found that the variant genotypes of the -656T>G were significantly 
associated with decreased breast cancer risk, compared with the wild genotype 
[TG/GG vs. TT: adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.71, 95% confidence interval 
(CI)=0.56-0.91], and the protective effect of this polymorphism was more 
predominant among the subgroups of younger subjects (<52 years) (OR=0.65, 95% 
CI=0.46-0.92). Besides, we found that the variant genotypes were associated with 
less frequent lymph node metastasis (P=0.020, OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.44-0.94). We did 
not observe any significant association between the 1349T>G polymorphism and 
breast cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the APE1 -656T>G but not the 1349T>G 
polymorphism may influence the susceptibility and progression of breast cancer 
in the Chinese population. Large population-based prospective studies are 
required to validate these findings.
