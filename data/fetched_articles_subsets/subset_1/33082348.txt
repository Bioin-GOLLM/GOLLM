Directly linked porphyrin dimers have attracted considerable attention because 
of their intriguing electronic features. Most emphasis has been placed on either 
dimers with large dihedral angles between the constituent planar monomeric 
subunits or those with overall planarity, referred to as "Planar-Twisted-Planar" 
and "Planar-Planar-Planar", respectively. Herein, we report a 
"Twisted-Planar-Twisted" framework, the hexaphyrin dimer D that exists in a 
trans configuration. Treatment of D with MeOH affords two isomeric dimers, MD1 
and MD2, both of which incorporate a methoxy moiety and exist in cis 
orientations with respect to the tethering linkage. The methanol-promoted 
conversion is accompanied by a readily discernible color change from green to 
brown and is not induced to an appreciable level by other alcohols. Dimer D thus 
acts as a rudimentary, albeit highly selective, reaction-based methanol 
indicator. This work provides a promising approach for constructing 
reaction-based chemosensors using porphyrinoid dimers of nonplanar subunits with 
biased reactivity.
