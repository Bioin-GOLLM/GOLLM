The oligomerization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a fact that 
deserves further attention as increases both the complexity and diversity of the 
receptor-mediated signal transduction, thus enriching the cell signaling. 
Consequently, in the present review we tackle among others the problems 
concerning the terminology used to describe aspects surrounding the GPCRs 
oligomerization phenomenon. Therefore, the theoretical implications of the GPCR 
oligomerization will be briefly discussed together with possible implications of 
this phenomenon especially for new strategies in drug development.
