Previous studies have suggested a link between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) 
and dementia risk. In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between 
SDB severity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease-biomarkers, and the 
ApoE alleles. A total of 95 cognitively normal elderly participants were 
analyzed for SDB severity, CSF measures of phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), total-tau 
(t-tau), and amyloid beta 42 (Aβ-42), as well as ApoE allele status. In ApoE3+ 
subjects, significant differences were found between sleep groups for p-tau 
(F[df2] = 4.3, p = 0.017), and t-tau (F[df2] = 3.3, p = 0.043). Additionally, 
among ApoE3+ subjects, the apnea and/or hypopnea with 4% O2-desaturation index 
was positively correlated with p-tau (r = 0.30, p = 0.023), t-tau (r = 0.31, p = 
0.021), and Aβ-42 (r = 0.31, p = 0.021). In ApoE2+ subjects, the apnea and/or 
hypopnea with 4% O2-desaturation index was correlated with lower levels of CSF 
Aβ-42 (r = -0.71, p = 0.004), similarly to ApoE4+ subjects where there was also 
a trend toward lower CSF Aβ-42 levels. Our observations suggest that there is an 
association between SDB and CSF Alzheimer's disease-biomarkers in cognitively 
normal elderly individuals. Existing therapies for SDB such as continuous 
positive airway pressure could delay the onset to mild cognitive impairment or 
dementia in normal elderly individuals.
