PURPOSE: Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a 
well-established imaging method for localizing primary prostate cancer (PCa) and 
for guiding targeted prostate biopsies. [18F]DCFPyL positron emission tomography 
combined with MRI (PSMA-PET/MRI) might be of additional value to localize 
primary PCa. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic performance of 
[18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI vs. mpMRI in tumour localization based on histopathology 
after robot-assisted radical-prostatectomy (RARP), also assessing biopsy advice 
for potential image-guided prostate biopsies.
METHODS: Thirty prospectively included patients with intermediate to high-risk 
PCa underwent [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI prior to RARP. Two nuclear medicine 
physicians and two radiologists assessed tumour localization on 
[18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and on mpMRI respectively, and gave a prostate biopsy advice 
(2 segments) using a 14-segment model of the prostate. The uro-pathologist 
evaluated the RARP specimen for clinically significant PCa (csPCa) using the 
same model. csPCa was defined as any PCa with Grade Group (GG) ≥ 2. The biopsy 
advice based on imaging was correlated with the final histology in the RARP 
specimen for a total-agreement analysis. An additional near-agreement 
correlation was performed to approximate clinical reality.
RESULTS: Overall, 142 of 420 (33.8%) segments contained csPCa after pathologic 
examination. The segments recommended for targeted biopsy contained the highest 
GG PCa segment in 27/30 patients (90.0%) both for [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI. 
Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value 
(NPV) for the total-agreement detection of csPCa per segment using 
[18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI were 0.70, 50.0%, 89.9%, 71.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. 
These results were 0.75, 54.2%, 94.2%, 82.8%, and 80.1%, respectively, for mpMRI 
only.
CONCLUSION: Both [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and mpMRI were only partly able to detect 
csPCa on a per-segment basis. An accurate detection (90.0%) of the highest GG 
lesion at patient-level was observed when comparing both [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI and 
mpMRI biopsy advice with the histopathology in the RARP specimen. So, despite 
the finding that [18F]DCFPyL-PET/MRI adequately detects csPCa, it does not 
outperform mpMRI.
