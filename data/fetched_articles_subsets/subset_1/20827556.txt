One of the largest clusters of genetic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (gCJD) is found 
among Jews of Libyan origin in Israel and is linked to the E200K mutation in 
PRNP (gCJDE200K). The aim of this study was to compare the levels of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, Tau and 14-3-3 proteins, between gCJDE200K 
patients, sporadic CJD (sCJD) patients and non-CJD controls in Israel between 
the years 1996-2006. The levels of Tau and 14-3-3 proteins in CSF were measured 
by ELISA and immunoblotting, respectively. CSF Tau levels were similar in 
gCJDE200K and sCJD, both were significantly higher than in controls 
[1,107 ± 470 pg/ml [33/46 (72%)] of the cases >1,000 pg/ml, 1,280 ± 580 pg/ml 
[25/30 (83.3%)], and 354 ± 338 pg/ml [17/243 (6.9%)], respectively, p < 0.001]. 
14-3-3 was detected in CSF of 41/53 (77%) of each gCJDE200K and sCJD patients 
tested, but only in 70/417 (16.8%) of controls (p < 0.001). An inverse 
correlation was found between disease duration and Tau levels in both gCJDE200K 
and sCJD (r = -0.464 and r = -0.284). No difference was found in Tau or 14-3-3 
between the various codon 129 genotypes. We conclude that CSF biomarkers, Tau 
and 14-3-3, may be used in the diagnosis in both patients' populations, 
presenting a similar sensitivity yet Tau assay having higher specificity.
