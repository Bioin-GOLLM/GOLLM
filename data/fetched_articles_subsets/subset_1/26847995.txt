BACKGROUND: Genetic variations in some of the selenoprotein genes, alone or 
together with an individual's selenium status, may influence risk or progression 
of prostate cancer. We investigated the impact of genetic variants of 
selenoproteins on plasma selenium levels and cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis 
in men with localized prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 722 patients seen at Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute who had localized/locally advanced PCa (i.e., stage T3 or less, N0, 
and M0) from 1994 to 2001. Fifty-five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) from six selenoprotein genes (TXNRD1, TXNRD2, SEP15, GPX3, SELENBP1, and 
SEPP1) were analyzed. Logistic regression is used to examine associations of 
genotypes and plasma selenium levels with risk of aggressive disease, defined as 
D'Amico intermediate/high risk categories. Step down permutation was applied to 
adjust for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-eight patients (48%) had aggressive disease at 
diagnosis. Two SNPs were associated with cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis 
(unadjusted P = 0.017 and 0.018, respectively). The odds ratio for aggressive 
disease in patients carrying TXNRD2 rs1005873-AG/GG genotypes or SELENBP1 
rs10788804-AG/AA genotypes was 1.54 (95% CI = 1.08, 2.20) and 1.45 (95% 
CI = 1.07, 1.98), respectively, compared to TXNRD2 rs1005873-AA or SELENBP1 
rs10788804-GG carriers. Four SNPs in TXNRD2 (rs1005873, rs13054371, rs3788310, 
and rs9606174) and the rs230820 in SEPP1 were associated with plasma selenium 
levels (unadjusted P < 0.05). Permutation adjusted P-values were not 
statistically significant for all these comparisons at the cut-off point of 
0.05.
CONCLUSION: We identified polymorphisms in selenoproteins that may influence the 
plasma selenium levels and may be associated with the risk of presenting with 
aggressive PCa in men with localized or locally advanced PCa. These results 
should be validated in other independent datasets.
