CUL3 forms Cullin-Ring ubiquitin ligases (CRL) with Ring-box protein and 
BTB-adaptor proteins. A variety of BTB-adaptor proteins have been reported to 
interact with the N-terminus of CUL3, which makes it possible to recognize 
various substrates for degradation. Regarding the association of CUL3 with 
neurodevelopmental disorders, a recent study reported three patients with global 
developmental delay, who carried de novo variants in CUL3. Here, we describe a 
novel de novo CUL3 variant (c.158G > A, p.Ser53Asn) identified in a patient with 
global developmental delay, who presented some novel dysmorphic features, 
including macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, and cutis marmorata. 
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses identified significantly weaker 
binding ability to some BTB proteins in CUL3-S53N compared to wild-type. 
Interestingly, label-free quantification proteomics analysis of samples 
immunoprecipitated by CUL3-S53N showed a significantly decreased interaction 
with some BTB proteins, while almost equal interaction or significantly 
increased interaction was observed with other BTB proteins. The binding between 
CUL3 and BTB proteins is essential for CRL substrate recognition, and alteration 
of their interaction is thought to result in the quantitative alteration in 
substrate proteins. It is possible that the difference of dysmorphic features 
between the present case and previously reported cases is caused by the 
distinctive effect of each CUL3 variant on substrate proteins. The clinical 
information of the present case will expand the picture of CUL3-related global 
developmental disorders, and subsequent cell biological analysis of the novel 
mutation will provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of how 
CUL3 pathogenic variants cause neurological disorders.
