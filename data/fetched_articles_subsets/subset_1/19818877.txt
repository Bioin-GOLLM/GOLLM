Carbonic anhydrases are archetypical zinc metalloenzymes and as such, they have 
been developed as the recognition element of a family of fluorescent indicators 
(sensors) to detect metal ions, particularly Zn(2+) and Cu(2+). Subtle 
modification of the structure of human carbonic anhydrase II isozyme (CAII) 
alters the selectivity, sensitivity, and response time for these sensors. 
Sensors using CAII variants coupled with zinc-dependent fluorescent ligands 
demonstrate picomolar sensitivity, unmatched selectivity, ratiometric 
fluorescence signal, and near diffusion-controlled response times. Recently, 
these sensors have been applied to measuring the readily exchangeable 
concentrations of zinc in the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian tissue culture 
cells and concentrations of free Cu(2+) in seawater.
