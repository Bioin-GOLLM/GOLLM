PURPOSE: We evaluated whether Gly16Arg beta2-receptor genotype relates to 
impulse oscillometry (IOS) in a real-life clinic setting.
METHODS: Patients with persistent asthma taking inhaled 
corticosteroid ± long-acting beta-agonist (ICS ± LABA) were evaluated. We 
compared genotype groups comprising either no Arg copies (i.e. GlyGly) versus 
one or two Arg copies (i.e. ArgArg or ArgGly). IOS outcomes included total 
airway resistance at 5 Hz (R5), central airway resistance at 20 Hz (R20), 
peripheral airway resistance (R5-R20), reactance at 5 Hz, area under reactance 
curve (AX) and resonant frequency (RF). In addition, we recorded ACQ-5 and 
salbutamol use.
RESULTS: One hundred and twelve ICS-treated asthmatic patients (mean ICS dose 
1238 µg/day), mean age 43 years, ACQ 2.34, FEV1 82 %, R5 177 % were 
identified-89 were also taking LABA. 61 patients were GlyGly, while 14 were 
ArgArg and 37 were ArgGly. There were no significant differences in IOS 
outcomes, ACQ or salbutamol use between the genotypes. The allelic risk (as odds 
ratio) for less well-controlled asthma (as ACQ > 1.5) was 1.1 (95 % CI 
0.72-1.68) in relation to each Arg copy with a corresponding odds ratio for 
abnormal R5-R20 > 0.07kPA/l.s being 0.91 (95 % CI 0.57-1.44). 71 % of patients 
had an ACQ > 1.5 in the GlyGly group, versus 67 % in GlyArg/ArgArg group, with 
corresponding figures for abnormal R5-R20 > 0.07 kPa/l.s being 69 versus 73 %.
CONCLUSION: In a real-life clinic setting for patients with poorly controlled 
persistent asthma taking ICS ± LABA, we found no evidence of any relationship of 
Gly16Arg to IOS, ACQ or salbutamol use.
