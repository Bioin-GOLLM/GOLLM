Ciliogenesis is generally inhibited in dividing cells, however, it has been 
unclear which signaling cascades regulate the phenomenon. Here, we report that 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase suppresses ciliogenesis by 
directly phosphorylating the deubiquitinase USP8 on Tyr-717 and Tyr-810 in RPE1 
cells. These phosphorylations elevate the deubiquitinase activity, which then 
stabilizes the trichoplein-Aurora A pathway, an inhibitory mechanism of 
ciliogenesis. EGFR knockdown and serum starvation result in ciliogenesis through 
downregulation of the USP8-trichoplein-Aurora A signal. Moreover, primary cilia 
abrogation, which is induced upon IFT20 or Cep164 depletion, ameliorates the 
cell cycle arrest of EGFR knockdown cells. The present data reveal that the 
EGFR-USP8-trichoplein-Aurora A axis is a critical signaling cascade that 
restricts ciliogenesis in dividing cells, and functions to facilitate cell 
proliferation. We further show that usp8 knockout zebrafish develops 
ciliopathy-related phenotypes including cystic kidney, suggesting that USP8 is a 
regulator of ciliogenesis in vertebrates.
