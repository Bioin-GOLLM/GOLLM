Lassa fever (LF), caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is a viral hemorrhagic fever for 
which no approved vaccine or potent antiviral treatment is available. LF is a 
WHO priority disease and, together with rabies, a major health burden in West 
Africa. Here we present the development and characterization of an inactivated 
recombinant LASV and rabies vaccine candidate (LASSARAB) that expresses a 
codon-optimized LASV glycoprotein (coGPC) and is adjuvanted by a TLR-4 agonist 
(GLA-SE). LASSARAB elicits lasting humoral response against LASV and RABV in 
both mouse and guinea pig models, and it protects both guinea pigs and mice 
against LF. We also demonstrate a previously unexplored role for 
non-neutralizing LASV GPC-specific antibodies as a major mechanism of protection 
by LASSARAB against LF through antibody-dependent cellular functions. Overall, 
these findings demonstrate an effective inactivated LF vaccine and elucidate a 
novel humoral correlate of protection for LF.
