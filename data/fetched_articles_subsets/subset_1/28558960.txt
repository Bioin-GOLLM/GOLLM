Protease-activated receptors (PARs) are a ubiquitously expressed class of 
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that enable cells to respond to proteases in 
the extracellular environment in a nuanced and dynamic manner. PAR1 is the 
archetypal family member and has been the object of large-scale drug development 
programs since the 1990s. Vorapaxar and drotrecogin-alfa are approved 
PAR1-targeted therapeutics, but safety concerns have limited the clinical use of 
vorapaxar and questions regarding the efficacy of drotrecogin-alfa led to its 
withdrawal from the market. New understanding of mechanisms of PAR1 function, 
discovery of improved strategies for modifying PAR1 function, and identification 
of novel indications for PAR1 modulators have provided new opportunities for 
therapies targeting PAR1. In this review, we critically evaluate prospects for 
the next generation of PAR1-targeted therapeutics.
