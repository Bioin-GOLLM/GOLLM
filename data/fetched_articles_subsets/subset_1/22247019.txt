Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease with a genetic component for its 
etiology. Recently, a genetic association of a single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP), rs17039192 in HIF-2α with knee OA has been reported in a Japanese 
population; however, controversy exits for its replication and a role of HIF-2α 
in OA. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the SNP by a large-scale 
replication study. A total of 8,457 subjects (3,129 OA cases and 5,328 controls) 
from seven independent cohorts from six countries (Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, 
Greece, and Australia) were recruited and genotyped. The association of 
rs17039192 with knee OA was evaluated by meta-analyses. The association of the 
HIF-2α SNP was not replicated in any of the populations. Contrary to the 
previous report, the odds ratios (ORs) of the risk allele frequency were all 
less than 1. A combined analysis for the seven populations also showed no 
replication of the association (OR = 0.91, 95% confidence interval = 0.81-1.03). 
Our large-scale meta-analysis showed that the association of rs17039192 in 
HIF-2α with knee OA is negative. The significance of HIF-2α in human OA 
(idiopathic OA as a common disease) should be further evaluated carefully.
