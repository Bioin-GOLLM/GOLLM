Shewanella oneidensis, a metal reducer and facultative anaerobe, expresses a 
large number of c-type cytochromes, many of which function as anaerobic 
reductases. All of these proteins contain the typical heme-binding motif CXXCH 
and require the Ccm proteins for maturation. Two c-type cytochrome reductases 
also possess atypical heme-binding sites, the NrfA nitrite reductase (CXXCK) and 
the SirA sulfite reductase (CX12NKGCH). S. oneidensis MR-1 encodes two 
cytochrome c synthetases (CcmF and SirE) and two apocytochrome c chaperones 
(CcmI and SirG). SirE located in the sir gene cluster is required for the 
maturation of SirA, but not NrfA. Here we show that maturation of SirA requires 
the combined function of the two apocytochrome c chaperones CcmI and SirG. Loss 
of either protein resulted in decreased sulfite reductase. Furthermore, SirA was 
not detected in a mutant that lacked both chaperones, perhaps due to misfolding 
or instability. These results suggest that CcmI interacts with SirEFG during 
SirA maturation, and with CcmF during maturation of NrfA. Additionally, we show 
that CRP regulates expression of sirA via the newly identified transcriptional 
regulatory protein, SirR.
