We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding salmon proopiomelanocortin precursor. 
Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from pituitary neurointermediate lobes and used 
to construct a cDNA library. The library was screened with 17 mer of 
oligodeoxyribonucleotides specific for the hexapeptide sequence in salmon 
beta-endorphin I, Phe-Met-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Thr at positions 4-9 excluding the third 
nucleotide. One positive clone, pSSM17 containing an insert of 1303 base pairs 
(bp) was characterized. Sequence determination revealed that it possessed 
sequences covering the entire regions encoding ACTH and beta-lipotropin and that 
the mRNA had the same overall organization as those of other mammalian species, 
i.e., the following peptide hormones were arranged in order from 5' upstream, 
ACTH including alpha-melanotropin and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe 
peptide, beta-lipotropin including gamma-lipotropin, beta-melanotropin and 
beta-endorphin. Amino acid sequences for putative salmon ACTH, beta-, and 
gamma-lipotropin were predicted. Comparison of the salmon mRNA sequence with 
those of mammals showed that the regions of alpha- and beta-MSH are relatively 
homologous, but other regions are much less so, especially in the 3' 
nontranslated region where it is much longer and completely heterologous.
