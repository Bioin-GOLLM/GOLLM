To gain insight into the role of hydrophobic core-surface charge interactions in 
stabilizing cytochrome c, we investigated the influence of hydrophobic core 
residues on phosphate binding by mutating residues in yeast iso-2-cytochrome c 
to those corresponding to iso-l-cytochrome c in various combinations. Heat 
transition of ultraviolet CD was followed as a function of pH in the presence 
and absence of phosphate. Thermodynamic parameters were deduced. It was found 
that the I20V/V43A/M98L mutation in the hydrophobic core, whose locations are 
remote from the putative phosphate sites, modulates phosphate interactions. The 
modulation is pH dependent. The I20V/ M98L and V43A mutation effects are 
nonadditive. The results lead to a model analogous to that of Tsao, Evans, and 
Wennerstrom, where a domain associated with the ordered hydrophobic core is 
sensitive to the fields generated by the surface charges. Such an explanation 
would be in accord with the observed difference in thermal stability between 
iso-2 and horse cytochromes c.
