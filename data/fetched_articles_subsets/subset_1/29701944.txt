The unusual feature of a t-butyl group is found in several marine-derived 
natural products including apratoxin A, a Sec61 inhibitor produced by the 
cyanobacterium Moorea bouillonii PNG 5-198. Here, we determine that the 
apratoxin A t-butyl group is formed as a pivaloyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) by 
AprA, the polyketide synthase (PKS) loading module of the apratoxin A 
biosynthetic pathway. AprA contains an inactive "pseudo" GCN5-related 
N-acetyltransferase domain (ΨGNAT) flanked by two methyltransferase domains (MT1 
and MT2) that differ distinctly in sequence. Structural, biochemical, and 
precursor incorporation studies reveal that MT2 catalyzes unusually coupled 
decarboxylation and methylation reactions to transform dimethylmalonyl-ACP, the 
product of MT1, to pivaloyl-ACP. Further, pivaloyl-ACP synthesis is primed by 
the fatty acid synthase malonyl acyltransferase (FabD), which compensates for 
the ΨGNAT and provides the initial acyl-transfer step to form AprA malonyl-ACP. 
Additionally, images of AprA from negative stain electron microscopy reveal 
multiple conformations that may facilitate the individual catalytic steps of the 
multienzyme module.
