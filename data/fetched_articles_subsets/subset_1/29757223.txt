Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a critical issue that affects the reliability of 
hydrogenation reactors. The hydrogen diffusivity/trap characteristics of 
2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel are important parameters mainly used to study the HE 
mechanism of steel alloys. In this work, the hydrogen diffusivity/trap 
characteristics of heat-treated (annealed) and untreated 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steel 
were studied using an electrochemical permeation method. The microstructures of 
both 2.25Cr-1Mo-0.25V steels were investigated by metallurgical microscopy. The 
effect of cementite on the hydrogen diffusivity/trap mechanisms was studied 
using thermodynamics-based and Lennard‚ÅªJones potential theories. The results 
revealed that the cementite located at the grain boundaries and at the 
interfaces of lath ferrite served as a kind of hydrogen trap (i.e., an 
irreversible hydrogen trap). In addition, hydrogen was transported from ferrite 
to cementite via up-hill diffusion, thereby supporting the hypothesis of 
cementite acting as a hydrogen trap.
