BACKGROUND: Preliminary data suggest that combining savolitinib, a potent and 
highly selective MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), with osimertinib, a 
third-generation, irreversible, oral epidermal growth factor receptor-TKI 
(EGFR-TKI), may overcome MET-based resistance to EGFR-TKIs.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and tolerability of savolitinib in Japanese 
patients with advanced solid malignancies.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In Part C of the phase Ib, multi-arm, open-label, 
multicenter TATTON study, two cohorts of Japanese adult patients were evaluated 
across six study centers in Japan. Patients with advanced solid malignancies 
received oral savolitinib monotherapy 400 mg once daily (qd), escalating to 600 
mg; patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRm) non-small-cell lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) who progressed on prior EGFR-TKI received oral osimertinib 
80 mg+savolitinib 300/400/600 mg qd combination therapy. Primary endpoints: 
safety/tolerability of savolitinib±osimertinib, and maximum tolerated dose(s) 
(MTD) definition.
RESULTS: Seventeen patients received monotherapy; 12 received combination. 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs): with monotherapy, 400 mg, none reported; 600 
mg, n = 3/9 evaluable patients (33%) reported DLTs (grade 3 and 4 alanine 
aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase increased, and grade 4 drug-induced 
liver injury). With combination: 400 mg, 1/6 (17%) reported DLTs (grade 2 
fatigue, nausea, and myalgia); 300 mg, none reported; 600 mg, 3/4 (75%) reported 
DLTs (grade 2 pyrexia, grade 3 skin reaction, and anaphylactic shock). Grade ≥3 
adverse events were reported in 41% of patients receiving monotherapy and 33% 
receiving combination. TATTON is no longer recruiting patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The MTD of savolitinib was 400 mg qd in both cohorts. Data 
demonstrate an acceptable safety profile for savolitinib alone, or with 
osimertinib.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02143466; 21 May 2014.

Plain Language Summary: For patients with epidermal growth factor receptor 
mutation-positive (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors, like osimertinib, are the standard treatment. However, for 
most patients, these treatments eventually stop working, as tumors develop 
resistance to them. Early studies suggest that combining osimertinib with 
savolitinib can overcome this resistance. We report Part C of the four-part 
TATTON study, in which two groups of Japanese adult patients received treatment. 
One group received savolitinib 400 mg once daily, then 600 mg. The other group 
received osimertinib 80 mg with savolitinib 300/400/600 mg once daily. The main 
objective of the study was to determine the maximum dose of savolitinib that 
patients could receive (maximum tolerated dose) and to monitor the safety of the 
combination. Overall, 17 patients received savolitinib alone and 12 received the 
combination. The maximum tolerated dose of savolitinib was found to be 400 mg 
once daily in both groups of patients. The data demonstrated that savolitinib 
had acceptable safety outcomes either alone, or in combination with osimertinib.
