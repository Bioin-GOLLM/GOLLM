The COVID-19 pandemic has had enormous health, economic, and social 
consequences. Vaccines have been successful in reducing rates of infection and 
hospitalization, but there is still a need for an acute treatment for the 
disease. We investigate whether compounds that bind the human ACE2 protein can 
interrupt SARS-CoV-2 replication without damaging ACE2â€™s natural enzymatic 
function. Initial compounds were screened for binding to ACE2 but little 
interruption of ACE2 enzymatic activity. This set of compounds was extended by 
application of quantitative structure-activity analysis, which resulted in 512 
virtual hits for further confirmatory screening. A subsequent SARS-CoV-2 
replication assay revealed that five of these compounds inhibit SARS-CoV-2 
replication in human cells. Further effort is required to completely determine 
the antiviral mechanism of these compounds, but they serve as a strong starting 
point for both development of acute treatments for COVID-19 and research into 
the mechanism of infection.
