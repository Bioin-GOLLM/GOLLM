AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of IL-18 137 G > C, 
607 C > A gene polymorphism in Uyghur population with chronic periodontitis (CP) 
and combine the results with the meta-analysis.
METHODS: In a case-control study, 200 cases with CP and 100 healthy controls 
were recruited; IL-18 137 G > C, 607 C > A genotyping was performed by 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). 
In the meta-analysis, we used electronic databases, including CNKI, Wan Fang, 
PubMed, EMBASE databases etc.to obtain relevant research published through June 
2020. Studies were considered eligible if odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI) were provided or calculated from the given data. The size of 
the combined effect was calculated using STATA 15.0.
RESULTS: Our study revealed significant association between CP and IL-18 
137 G > C (P = .045, OR = 1.67), 607 C > A (P = .045, OR = 1.67). The overall 
meta-analysis revealed significant associations between IL-18 137 G > C 
polymorphism and CP risk in Allele, dominant, co-dominant and recessive genetic 
models. The subgroup analysis also showed a significant association between the 
IL-18 137 G > C and risk for periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis in the 
Asian (GC+ CC VS. GG: P = .047, OR = 1.64,95%CI = 1.01-2.68).
CONCLUSIONS: IL-18 137 G > C, 607 C > A could be associated with susceptibility 
to periodontitis in Uyghur population. Further case-control of candidate genes 
studies targeting larger sample sizes and different ethnic groups are needed to 
arrive more accurate conclusions.
