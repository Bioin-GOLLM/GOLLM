Variants in IRF6 can lead to Van der Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium 
syndrome. Furthermore, genes upstream and downstream of IRF6, including GRHL3 
and TP63, are also associated with orofacial clefting. Additionally, a variant 
in an enhancer (MCS9.7) that regulates IRF6 is associated with risk for isolated 
orofacial clefting. This variant (rs642961) abrogates AP2A protein binding at 
MCS9.7. Here, we found that AP2A protein regulates MCS9.7 enhancer activity 
in vivo and IRF6 protein expression in epidermal development. In addition, loss 
of IRF6 leads to supra-basal expression of AP2A protein. Finally, using an IRF6 
allelic series, we found that either increasing or decreasing IRF6 protein 
expression can destabilize AP2A protein expression in vivo. These data suggest 
that IRF6 regulates AP2A protein level in epidermal development. Therefore, we 
conclude that IRF6 and TFAP2A are part of a genetic regulatory network that is 
critical in epithelial development, with implications for both orofacial and 
cutaneous tissues. Our work provides in vivo, functional data to explain the 
relationship between AP2A protein binding and the MCS9.7 enhancer in orofacial 
clefting. This work is important because the MCS9.7 enhancer element contains a 
variant that abrogates AP2A protein binding and increases risk for orofacial 
clefting worldwide.
