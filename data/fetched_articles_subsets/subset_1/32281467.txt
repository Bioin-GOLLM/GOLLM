Background: Usher syndrome is the most common hereditary syndrome combining 
deafness and blindness. In the 2017 National Child Count of Children and Youth 
who are Deaf-Blind, Usher syndrome represented 329 of 10,000 children, but there 
were also at least 70 other etiologies of deaf-blindness documented. The purpose 
of this study was to analyze the work-up and ultimate diagnoses of 21 
consecutive families who presented to the Genetic Eye-Ear Clinic (GEEC) at the 
University of Iowa. Our hypothesis was that most families referred to the GEEC 
would have initial and final diagnoses of Usher syndrome.Materials and Methods: 
Patients were identified through an IRB approved retrospective chart review of 
referrals to the GEEC between 2012 and 2019. Details about each patient's 
history, exam, and clinical and genetic work-up were recorded.Results: From 2012 
to 2019, 21 families (25 patients) were referred to the collaborative GEEC. 
Overall molecular diagnostic rate in this cohort was 14/21 (67%). Evaluation 
resulted in a change of diagnosis in 11/21 (52%) families. Ultimately, there 
were eleven unique diagnoses including hereditary, non-hereditary, and 
independent causes of combined visual impairment and hearing loss. The most 
common diagnosis was Usher syndrome, which represented 6/21 (29%) 
families.Conclusions: Providing a correct diagnosis for patients with visual 
impairment and hearing loss can be challenging for clinicians and their 
patients, but it can greatly improve clinical care and outcomes. We recommend an 
algorithm that includes multidisciplinary collaboration, careful clinical 
evaluation, strategic molecular testing, and consideration of a broad 
differential diagnosis.
