Foot and mouth disease, which is induced by the foot and mouth disease virus 
(FMDV), takes its toll on the cloven-hoofed domestic animals. The VP1 gene in 
FMDV genome encodes the viral capsid, a vital element for FMDV replication. 
Sleeping Beauty (SB) is an active DNA-transposon system responsible for genetic 
transformation and insertional mutagenesis in vertebrates. In this study, a 
conserved VP1-shRNA which specifically targets the ovine FMDV-VP1 gene was 
constructed and combined with SB transposase and transposon. Then, they were 
microinjected into pronuclear embryos to breed transgenic sheep. Ninety-two 
lambs were born and the VP1-shRNA was positively integrated into eight of them. 
The rate of transgenic sheep production in SB transposon system was 
significantly higher than that in controls (13.04% vs. 3.57% and 7.14%, 
P < 0.05). The ear fibroblasts of the transgenic lambs transfected with the 
PsiCheck2-VP1 vector had a significant inhibitory effect on the VP1 gene of the 
FMDV. In conclusion, the VP1-shRNA transgenic sheep were successfully generated 
by the current new method. The ear fibroblasts from these transgenic sheep 
possess a great resistance to FMDV. The result indicated that RNAi technology 
combining the "Sleeping Beauty" transposon system is an efficient method to 
produce transgenic animals.
