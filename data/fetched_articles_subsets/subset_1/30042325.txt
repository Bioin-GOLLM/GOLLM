The microtubule cytoskeleton is a primary organizer of viral infections for 
delivering virus particles to their sites of replication, establishing and 
maintaining subcellular compartments where distinct steps of viral morphogenesis 
take place, and ultimately dispersing viral progeny. One of the best 
characterized examples of virus motility is the anterograde transport of the 
wrapped virus form of vaccinia virus (VACV) from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 
to the cell periphery by kinesin-1. Yet many aspects of this transport event are 
elusive due to the speed of motility and the challenges of imaging this stage at 
high resolution over extended time periods. We have established a novel imaging 
technology to track virus transport that uses photoconvertible fluorescent 
recombinant viruses to track subsets of virus particles from their site of 
origin and determine their destination. Here we image virus exit from the TGN 
and their rate of egress to the cell periphery. We demonstrate a role for 
kinesin-1 engagement in regulating virus exit from the TGN by removing A36 and 
F12 function, critical viral mediators of kinesin-1 recruitment to virus 
particles. Phototracking viral particles and components during infection is a 
powerful new imaging approach to elucidate mechanisms of virus replication.
