There are two crystallographically independent complex mol-ecules with very 
similar geometries in the unit cell of the title compound, 
[Mn(C(6)H(4)NO(2))(2)(H(2)O)(2)]·0.5C(3)H(7)NO. The central ion is situated in a 
distorted octa-hedral environment of two N- and four O-donor atoms from two 
pyridine-2-carboxyl-ate ligands and two cis-disposed water mol-ecules. The 
carboxyl-ate ligands are coordinated in a chelate fashion with the formation of 
two five-membered rings. In the crystal, the complex mol-ecules are connected by 
O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds between the coordinated water mol-ecules and the 
uncoordinated carboxyl-ate O atoms, thus forming hydrogen-bonded walls disposed 
perpendicularly to the bc plane.
