BACKGROUND: Early repolarization syndrome (ERS) is associated with polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia (PVT) and ventricular fibrillation, leading to sudden 
cardiac death.
OBJECTIVE: The present study tests the hypothesis that the transient outward 
potassium current (Ito)-blocking effect of phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE-3) 
inhibitors plays a role in reversing repolarization heterogeneities responsible 
for arrhythmogenesis in experimental models of ERS.
METHODS: Transmembrane action potentials (APs) were simultaneously recorded from 
epicardial and endocardial regions of coronary-perfused canine left ventricular 
(LV) wedge preparations, together with a transmural pseudo-electrocardiogram. 
The Ito agonist NS5806 (7-15 μM) and L-type calcium current (ICa) blocker 
verapamil (2-3 μM) were used to induce an early repolarization pattern and PVT.
RESULTS: After stable induction of arrhythmogenesis, the PDE-3 inhibitors 
cilostazol and milrinone or isoproterenol were added to the coronary perfusate. 
All were effective in restoring the AP dome in the LV epicardium, thus 
abolishing the repolarization defects responsible for phase 2 reentry and PVT. 
Arrhythmic activity was suppressed in 7 of 8 preparations by cilostazol (10 μM), 
6 of 7 by milrinone (2.5 μM), and 7 of 8 by isoproterenol (0.1-1 μM). Using 
voltage clamp techniques applied to LV epicardial myocytes, both cilostazol (10 
μM) and milrinone (2.5 μM) were found to reduce Ito by 44.4% and 40.4%, 
respectively, in addition to their known effects to augment ICa.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PDE-3 inhibitors exert an ameliorative 
effect in the setting of ERS by producing an inward shift in the balance of 
current during the early phases of the epicardial AP via inhibition of Ito as 
well as augmentation of ICa, thus reversing the repolarization defects 
underlying the development of phase 2 reentry and ventricular 
tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation.
