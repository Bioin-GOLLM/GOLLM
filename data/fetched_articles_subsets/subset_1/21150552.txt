Some individuals have higher efavirenz plasma concentrations during 
rifampin-containing tuberculosis (TB) therapy, contrary to the expected 
induction effect of rifampin. Among HIV-infected patients without (n = 38) and 
with TB on rifampin-containing therapy (n = 18), we tested the hypothesis that 
drug-gene interaction may explain the highly variable drug interactions. Two-way 
analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between CYP2B6 516Gâ†’T 
polymorphism and rifampin-containing therapy, suggesting that efavirenz dose 
adjustment may need to be individualized on the basis of the patient's genotype.
