US28 is one of four G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) encoded by human 
cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The US28 protein (pUS28) is a potent signaling molecule 
that alters a variety of cellular pathways that ultimately alter the host cell 
environment. This viral GPCR is expressed not only in the context of lytic 
replication but also during viral latency, highlighting its multifunctional 
properties. pUS28 is a functional GPCR, and its manipulation of multiple 
signaling pathways likely impacts HCMV pathogenesis. Herein, we will discuss the 
impact of pUS28 on both lytic and latent infection, pUS28-mediated signaling and 
its downstream consequences, and the influence this viral GPCR may have on 
disease states, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. We will also 
discuss the potential for and progress towards exploiting pUS28 as a novel 
therapeutic to combat HCMV.
