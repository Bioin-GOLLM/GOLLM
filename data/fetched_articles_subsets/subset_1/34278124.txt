Many lectins have been reported to have antitumor activities; identifying the 
glycan ligands in tumor cells of lectins is crucial for lectin clinical 
application. An edible mushroom galectin, Agrocybe aegerita lectin (AAL/AAGL), 
that has a high antitumor activity has been reported. In this paper, based on 
the glycan array data, it is showed that the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF 
antigen)-related O-glycans were found to be highly correlated with the antitumor 
activity of AAL/AAGL. Further glycosyltransferase quantification suggested that 
the ratio between GAL3ST2 and ST3GAL1 (GAL3ST2/ST3GAL1), which determined the 
3'-sulfo-TF expression level, was highly correlated with the antitumor activity 
of AAL/AAGL. Overexpressing the enzyme of GAL3ST2 in HL60 and HeLa cell lines 
could increase the growth inhibition ratio of AAL/AAGL from 22.7 to 43.9% and 
27.8 to 39.1%, respectively. However, ST3GAL1 in Jurkat cells could decrease the 
growth inhibition ratio from 44.7 to 35.6%. All the data suggested that the 
3'-sulfo-TF antigen is one of the main glycan ligands that AAL/AAGL recognizes 
in tumor cells. AAL/AAGL may potentially serve as a reagent for cancer diagnosis 
and a targeted therapy for the 3'-sulfo-TF antigen.
