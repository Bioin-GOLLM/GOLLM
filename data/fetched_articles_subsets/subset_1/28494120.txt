BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) is associated with disrupted default mode network (DMN) connectivity, but 
findings across studies have not been uniform. Individual differences in 
relevant genes may account for some of the reported variability in the 
relationship between DMN connectivity and PTSD. In this study, we investigated 
this possibility using genome-wide association study (GWAS) derived polygenic 
risk scores (PRSs) for relevant psychiatric traits. We hypothesized that the 
association between PTSD and DMN connectivity would be moderated by genetic risk 
for one or more psychiatric traits such that individuals with elevated polygenic 
risk for psychopathology and severe PTSD would exhibit disrupted DMN 
connectivity.
METHODS: Participants were 156 white, non-Hispanic veterans of the wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan who were genotyped and underwent resting state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessment. PRSs for neuroticism, 
anxiety, major depressive disorder, and cross-disorder risk (based on five 
psychiatric disorders) were calculated using summary statistics from published 
large-scale consortia-based GWASs.
RESULTS: Cross-disorder polygenic risk influenced the relationship between DMN 
connectivity and PTSD symptom severity such that individuals at greater genetic 
risk showed a significant negative association between PTSD symptom severity and 
connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex and right middle temporal 
gyrus. Polygenic risk for neuroticism, anxiety, and major depressive disorder 
did not influence DMN connectivity directly or through an interaction with PTSD.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings illustrate the potential power of genome-wide PRSs to 
advance understanding of the relationship between PTSD and DMN connectivity, a 
putative neural endophenotype of the disorder.
