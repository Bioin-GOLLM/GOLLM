The Warburg effect has immensely succored the study of cancer biology, 
especially in highlighting the role of mitochondria in cancer stemness and their 
benefaction to the malignancy of oxidative and glycolytic cancer cells. 
Mitochondrial genetics have represented a focal point in cancer therapeutics due 
to the involvement of mitochondria in programmed cell death. The mitochondrion 
has been well established as a switch in cell death decisions. The 
mitochondrion's instrumental role in central bioenergetics, calcium homeostasis, 
and translational regulation has earned it its fame in metastatic dissemination 
in cancer cells. Here, we revisit and review mechanisms through which 
mitochondria influence oncogenesis and metastasis by underscoring the oncogenic 
mitochondrion that is capable of transferring malignant capacities to recipient 
cells.
