Pathophysiology of the motoneuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is 
non-cell-autonomous. In mouse models of familiar ALS, neurotoxicity is derived 
not only from mutant motor neurons but also from mutant neighbouring glial 
cells. In vivo imaging by two-photon laser-scanning microscopy was used to study 
rapid morphological reactions of astroglial cells towards laser-induced axonal 
transection in ALS-linked transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice. In the affected lateral 
spinal cord, mutated astroglial cells extended branches towards injured axons 
within a time frame of minutes to hours post lesion while in control animals 
astrocytes lack any rapid morphological alteration within the studied time 
frame. This suggests that astrocytes partially contribute to the rapid response 
of non-neuronal cells to acute axonal lesions in ALS mice.
