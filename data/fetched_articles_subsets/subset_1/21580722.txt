2-Methyl-N-p-tolyl-benzamide: a second monoclinic polymorph.

Saeed A, Khera RA, Simpson J.

The title compound, C(15)H(15)NO, (I), is a polymorph of the structure (II) 
reported by Gowda et al. [Acta Cryst. (2008), E64, o1494]. Compound (II) 
crystalllizes in the space group C2/c (Z = 8), whereas the title compound occurs 
in space group P2(1)/c (Z = 4). The two mol-ecular structures differ slightly in 
the relative orientations of their central amide group with respect to the 
benzoyl ring [dihedral angles of 55.99 (7) for (I) and 59.96 (11)° for (II)] and 
in the inclination of the benzoyl and aniline rings [88.67 (8) for (I) and 
81.44 (5)° for (II)]. In the crystal structure of (I), mol-ecules are linked by 
N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, forming C(4) chains, which are augmented by weak C-H⋯O 
inter-actions. The structure is further stabilized by C-H⋯π contacts involving 
both of the aromatic rings.
