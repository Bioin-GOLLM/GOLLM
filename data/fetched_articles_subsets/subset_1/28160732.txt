Four SNPs (rs7482144, rs4671393, rs28384513 and rs4895441) associated with HbF 
levels have been identified in different populations worldwide. To explore 
whether these SNPs modulate HbF expression in Chinese Zhuang population, 436 
Chinese Zhuang β-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI) patients were divided into high 
HbF level group (mean HbF=25.5%, n=218) and low group (mean HbF=6.51%, n=218) 
for genotyping using PCR-HRM method. Results demonstrated that there was a 
significantly higher minor allele frequency (MAF=34.2%) of rs4895441 (G) in HMIP 
in high HbF level group than that in low group (MAF=19.8%) (P=0.001, OR=1.73, 
95% CI: 1.24-2.57). The cumulative effects of risk genotypes of these loci for 
patients carrying any combination of 1, 2 or 3 risk genotype had a gradually 
increased risk of high HbF level phenotype compared to those without the risk 
genotypes (OR=1.50-9.06, P=0.0008); Gene-gene interaction of rs7842144 and 
rs4895441 showed the best model with the smallest prediction error (0.4259) and 
the greatest consistency of coefficient of variation (P=0.01). We concluded that 
rs4895441, G on HMIP might be a high-risk modifier variant for high HbF level 
expression, and HBG2, BCL11A and HMIP genes, as HbF quantitative trait loci 
(QTL) could have a synergistic effect on increasing the HbF level in Chinese 
Zhuang β-TI patients.
