Loss of epithelial differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are 
known to facilitate cancer progression and are associated with poor prognosis in 
patients with lung cancer. We have identified Receptor-interacting 
serine/threonine protein kinase 4 (RIP4) as a regulator of tumor differentiation 
in lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Bioinformatics analyses of human lung AC samples 
showed that poorly differentiated tumors express low levels of RIP4, whereas 
high levels are associated with better overall survival. In vitro, lung tumor 
cells expressing reduced RIP4 levels showed enhanced activation of STAT3 
signaling and had a greater ability to invade through collagen. In contrast, 
overexpression of RIP4 inhibited STAT3 activation, which abrogated 
interleukin-6-dependent induction of lysyl oxidase, a collagen cross-linking 
enzyme. In an autochthonous mouse model of lung AC initiated by Kras(G12D) 
expression with loss of p53, Rip4 knockdown tumors progressed to a poorly 
differentiated state marked by an increase in Hmga2, reduced Ttf1, and 
enrichment of genes regulating extracellular remodeling and Jak-Stat signaling. 
Tail vein injections of cells overexpressing Rip4 showed a reduced potential to 
invade and form tumors, which was restored by co-expression of Stat3. 
Altogether, our work has identified that loss of RIP4 enhances STAT3 signaling 
in lung cancer cells, promoting the expression of ECM remodeling genes and 
cancer dedifferentiation.
