Although mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transfer has long drawn attention owing 
to its immunosuppressive potential to treat immune-mediated diseases, the role 
of endogenous MSCs in immune regulation in vivo has remained largely unclear. 
MSCs constitute the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, perhaps contributing to 
immune protection of HSCs, termed immune privilege. Our recent study 
demonstrates that immune privilege of HSCs is endowed by niche-residential 
regulatory T cells (Tregs), which promote allogeneic HSC engraftment. This 
immune privilege depends on cell surface ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 on niche 
Tregs, which generate extracellular adenosine, a nucleotide known to suppress 
immunity and potentiate Tregs. Another niche constituent, leptin 
receptor-expressing (lepr+) perivascular MSCs, also highly express CD39 and 
CD73, prompting us to study their roles in immune privilege. This work 
demonstrates an unexpected negative regulation of immune privilege by 
MSC-derived adenosine. CD39 deletion in lepr+ cells increased and potentiated 
effector memory-like niche Tregs, promoting allogeneic HSC engraftment. CD39 
deletion in Tregs also activated niche Tregs, while abrogating engraftment. 
These observations demonstrate paradoxical effects of MSC-derived adenosine to 
activate immunity, revealing a previously undescribed dual roles of adenosine. 
Adenosine from both Tregs and MSCs inhibits niche Tregs, whereas adenosine from 
Tregs, but not that from MSCs, acts as an effector molecule of immune privilege.
