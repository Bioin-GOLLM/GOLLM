OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic association between the polymorphism of 
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) family genes and schizophrenia in the North 
Han Chinese.
METHODS: Method of polymerase chain reaction-based ligase detection reaction 
(PCR-LDR) was applied to genotype 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 
cPLA2 family genes among 201 pedigrees consisting of fathers, mothers and 
affected offsprings with schizophrenia. Haplotype relative risk (HRR) test, 
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), haplotype transmission analysis and 
multiple locus analysis were conducted to analyze the genotyping data.
RESULTS: The genotypic frequency of cPLA2 gene did not deviate from 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both case and control groups. HRR and TDT showed 
that the 10 SNPs were not associated with schizophrenia (P > 0.05). Analysis for 
haplotype transmission showed that no haplotype systems was associated with 
schizophrenia (P > 0.05). Results from COA and COG tests showed a disease 
association for the rs2162886-rs1668589, rs891014-rs1668589 and 
rs2307279-rs7542180 combinations (chi2 = 6.913, P = 0.032; chi2 = 8.393, P = 
0.015; chi2 = 8.447, P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Many loci in the cPLA2 family genes were associated with 
schizophrenic.
