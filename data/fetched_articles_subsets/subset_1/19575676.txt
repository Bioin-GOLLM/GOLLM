Rolling adhesion on vascular surfaces is the first step in recruiting 
circulating leukocytes, hematopoietic progenitors, or platelets to specific 
organs or to sites of infection or injury. Rolling requires the rapid yet 
balanced formation and dissociation of adhesive bonds in the challenging 
environment of blood flow. This review explores how structurally distinct 
adhesion receptors interact through mechanically regulated kinetics with their 
ligands to meet these challenges. Remarkably, increasing force applied to 
adhesive bonds first prolongs their lifetimes (catch bonds) and then shortens 
their lifetimes (slip bonds). Catch bonds mediate the counterintuitive 
phenomenon of flow-enhanced rolling adhesion. Force-regulated disruptions of 
receptor interdomain or intradomain interactions remote from the ligand-binding 
surface generate catch bonds. Adhesion receptor dimerization, clustering in 
membrane domains, and interactions with the cytoskeleton modulate the forces 
applied to bonds. Both inside-out and outside-in cell signals regulate these 
processes.
