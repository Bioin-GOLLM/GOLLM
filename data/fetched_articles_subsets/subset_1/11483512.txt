Many eukaryotic cell surface proteins are anchored to the plasma membrane via 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). The GPI transamidase mediates GPI anchoring 
in the endoplasmic reticulum, by replacing a protein's C-terminal GPI attachment 
signal peptide with a pre-assembled GPI. During this transamidation reaction, 
the GPI transamidase forms a carbonyl intermediate with a substrate protein. It 
was known that the GPI transamidase is a complex containing GAA1 and GPI8. Here, 
we report two new components of this enzyme: PIG-S and PIG-T. To determine roles 
for PIG-S and PIG-T, we disrupted these genes in mouse F9 cells by homologous 
recombination. PIG-S and PIG-T knockout cells were defective in transfer of GPI 
to proteins, particularly in formation of the carbonyl intermediates. We also 
demonstrate that PIG-S and PIG-T form a protein complex with GAA1 and GPI8, and 
that PIG-T maintains the complex by stabilizing the expression of GAA1 and GPI8. 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gpi16p (YHR188C) and Gpi17p (YDR434W) are orthologues 
of PIG-T and PIG-S, respectively.
