BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rates and extent of recovery after stroke vary 
considerably between individuals and genetic factors are thought to contribute 
to post-stroke outcome. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays important 
roles in brain plasticity and repair and has been shown to be involved in stroke 
severity, recovery, and outcome in animal models. Few clinical studies on BDNF 
genotypes in relation to ischemic stroke have been performed. The aims of the 
present study are therefore to investigate whether genetic variation at the BDNF 
locus is associated with initial stroke severity, recovery and/or short-term and 
long-term functional outcome after ischemic stroke.
METHODS: Four BDNF tagSNPs were analyzed in the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on 
Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS; 600 patients and 600 controls, all aged 18-70 years). 
Stroke severity was assessed using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Stroke recovery 
was defined as the change in NIHSS over a 3-month period. Short- and long-term 
functional outcome post-stroke was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at 3 
months and at 2 and 7 years after stroke, respectively.
RESULTS: No SNP was associated with stroke severity or recovery at 3 months and 
no SNP had an impact on short-term outcome. However, rs11030119 was 
independently associated with poor functional outcome 7-years after stroke (OR 
0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.92; P =  0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: BDNF gene variants were not major contributors to ischemic stroke 
severity, recovery, or short-term functional outcome. However, this study 
suggests that variants in the BDNF gene may contribute to poor long-term 
functional outcome after ischemic stroke.
