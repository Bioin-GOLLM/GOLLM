Patients harboring germline pathogenic biallelic variants in genes involved in 
the recognition and repair of DNA damage are known to have a substantially 
increased cancer risk. Emerging evidence suggests that individuals harboring 
heterozygous variants in these same genes may also be at heightened, albeit 
lesser, risk for cancer. Herein, we sought to determine whether heterozygous 
variants in RECQL4, the gene encoding an essential DNA helicase that is 
defective in children with the autosomal recessive cancer-predisposing condition 
Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), are associated with increased risk for 
childhood cancer. To address this question, we interrogated germline sequence 
data from 4435 pediatric cancer patients at St. Jude Children's Research 
Hospital and 1127 from the National Cancer Institute Therapeutically Applicable 
Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET) database and identified 24 
(0.43%) who harbored loss-of-function (LOF) RECQL4 variants, including five of 
249 (2.0%) with osteosarcoma (OS). These RECQL4 variants were significantly 
overrepresented in children with OS, the cancer most frequently observed in 
patients with RTS, as compared to 134,187 noncancer controls in the Genome 
Aggregation Database (gnomAD v2.1; P = 0.00087, odds ratio [OR] = 7.1, 95% CI, 
2.9-17). Nine of the 24 (38%) individuals possessed the same c.1573delT 
(p.Cys525Alafs) variant located in the highly conserved DNA helicase domain, 
suggesting that disruption of this domain is central to oncogenesis. Altogether 
these data expand our understanding of the genetic factors predisposing to 
childhood cancer and reveal a novel association between heterozygous RECQL4 LOF 
variants and development of pediatric OS.
