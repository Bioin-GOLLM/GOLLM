Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutation-positive non-smallcell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) is incurable, despite high rates of response to EGFR tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We investigated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Src 
family kinases and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as genetic modifiers of innate 
resistance in EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC. We performed gene expression 
analysis in two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) of EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC 
patients treated with EGFR TKI. We evaluated the efficacy of gefitinib or 
osimertinib with the Src/FAK/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor, TPX0005 in vitro 
and in vivo. In Cohort 1, CUB domain-containing protein-1 (CDCP1) was an 
independent negative prognostic factor for progression-free survival (hazard 
ratio of 1.79, p=0.0407) and overall survival (hazard ratio of 2.23, p=0.0192). 
A two-gene model based on AXL and CDCP1 expression was strongly associated with 
the clinical outcome to EGFR TKIs, in both cohorts of patients. Our preclinical 
experiments revealed that several RTKs and non-RTKs, were up-regulated at 
baseline or after treatment with gefitinib or osimertinib. TPX-0005 plus EGFR 
TKI suppressed expression and activation of RTKs and downstream signaling 
intermediates. Co-expression of CDCP1 and AXL is often observed in 
EGFR-mutation-positive tumors, limiting the efficacy of EGFR TKIs. Co-treatment 
with EGFR TKI and TPX-0005 warrants testing.
