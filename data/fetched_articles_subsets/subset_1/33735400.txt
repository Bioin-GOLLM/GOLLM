Voltage-gated sodium channels (NavChs) are pore-forming membrane proteins that 
regulate the transport of sodium ions through the cell membrane. Understanding 
the structure and function of NavChs is of major biophysical, as well as 
clinical, importance given their key role in cellular pathophysiology. In this 
work, we provide a computational framework for modeling system-size-dependent, 
i.e., cumulative, atomic properties around a NavCh's pore. We illustrate our 
methodologies on the bacterial NavAb channel captured in a closed-pore state 
where we demonstrate that the atomic environment around its pore exhibits a 
bi-phasic spatial organization dictated by the structural separation of the pore 
domains (PDs) from the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). Accordingly, a 
mathematical model describing packing of atoms around NavAb's pore is 
constructed that allows-under certain conservation conditions-for a power-law 
approximation of the cumulative hydropathic dipole field effect acting along 
NavAb's pore. This verified the non-extensitivity hypothesis for the closed-pore 
NavAb channel and revealed a long-range hydropathic interactions law regulating 
atom-packing around the NavAb's selectivity filter. Our model predicts a 
PDs-VSDs coupling energy of [Formula: see text] kcal/mol corresponding to a 
global maximum of the atom-packing energy profile. Crucially, we demonstrate for 
the first time how critical phenomena can emerge in a single-channel structure 
as a consequence of the non-extensive character of its atomic porous 
environment.
