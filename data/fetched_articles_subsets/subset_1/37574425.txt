BACKGROUND: Adequate glucose supply is essential for brain function, therefore 
hypoglycemic states may lead to seizures. Since blood glucose supply for brain 
is buffered by liver glycogen, an impairment of liver glycogen synthesis by 
mutations in the liver glycogen synthase gene (GYS2) might result in a 
substantial neurological involvement. Here, we describe the phenotypes of 
affected siblings of two families harboring biallelic mutations in GYS2.
METHODS: Two suspected families - a multiplex Pakistani family (family A) with 
three affected siblings and a family of Moroccan origin (family B) with a single 
affected child who presented with seizures and reduced fasting blood glucose 
levels were genetically characterized. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was 
performed on the index patients, followed by Sanger sequencing-based segregation 
analyses on all available members of both families.
RESULTS: The variant prioritization of WES and later Sanger sequencing confirmed 
three mutations in the GYS2 gene (12p12.1) consistent with an autosomal 
recessive pattern of inheritance. A homozygous splice acceptor site variant 
(NM_021957.3, c. 1646 -2A>G) segregated in family A. Two novel compound 
heterozygous variants (NM_021957.3: c.343G>A; p.Val115Met and NM_021957.3: 
c.875A>T; p.Glu292Val) were detected in family B, suggesting glycogen storage 
disorder. A special diet designed to avoid hypoglycemia, in addition to change 
of the anti-seizure medication led to reduction in seizure frequency.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the seizures in patients initially 
diagnosed with epilepsy might be directly caused, or influenced by hypoglycemia 
due to pathogenic variants in the GYS2 gene.
