The Berlin Fat Mouse Inbred (BFMI) line harbors a major recessive gene defect on 
chromosome 3 (jobes1) leading to juvenile obesity and metabolic syndrome. The 
present study aimed at the identification of metabolites that might be linked to 
recessively acting genes in the obesity locus. Firstly, serum metabolites were 
analyzed between obese BFMI and lean B6 and BFMI × B6 F1 mice to identify 
metabolites that are different. In a second step, a metabolite-protein network 
analysis was performed linking metabolites typical for BFMI mice with genes of 
the jobes1 region. The levels of 22 diacyl-phosphatidylcholines (PC aa), two 
lyso-PC and three carnitines were found to be significantly lower in obese mice 
compared with lean mice, while serine, glycine, arginine and 
hydroxysphingomyelin were higher for the same comparison. The network analysis 
identified PC aa C42:1 as functionally linked with the genes Ccna2 and Trpc3 via 
the enzymes choline kinase alpha and phospholipase A2 group 1B (PLA2G1B), 
respectively. Gene expression analysis revealed elevated Ccna2 expression in 
adipose tissue of BFMI mice. Furthermore, unique mutations were found in the 
Ccna2 promoter of BFMI mice which are located in binding sites for transcription 
factors or micro RNAs and could cause differential Ccna2 mRNA levels between 
BFMI and B6 mice. Increased expression of Ccna2 was consistent with higher 
mitotic activity of adipose tissue in BFMI mice. Therefore, we suggest a higher 
demand for PC necessary for adipose tissue growth and remodeling. This study 
highlights the relationship between metabolite profiles and the underlying 
genetics of obesity in the BFMI line.
