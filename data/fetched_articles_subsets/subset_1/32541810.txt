The villous cytotrophoblastic cells have the ability to fuse and differentiate, 
forming the syncytiotrophoblast (STB). The syncytialisation process is essential 
for placentation. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in cell fusion and 
differentiation are yet to be fully elucidated. It has been suggested that cell 
surface glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) was involved in this process. In 
multiple cancer cells, cell membrane-located GRP78 has been reported to act as a 
receptor binding to the active form of α2-macroglobulin (α2M*), activating thus 
several cellular signalling pathways implicated in cell growth and survival. We 
hypothesised that GRP78 interaction with α2M* may also activate signalling 
pathways in trophoblastic cells, which, in turn, may promote cell fusion. Here, 
we observed that α2M mRNA is highly expressed in trophoblastic cells, whereas it 
is not expressed in the choriocarcinoma cell line BeWo. We thus took advantage 
of forskolin-induced syncytialisation of BeWo cells to study the effect of 
exogenous α2M* on syncytialisation. We first demonstrated that α2M* induced 
trophoblastic cell fusion. This effect is dependent on α2M*-GRP78 interaction, 
ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation, and unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. 
Overall, these data provide novel insights into the signalling molecules and 
mechanisms regulating trophoblastic cell fusion.
