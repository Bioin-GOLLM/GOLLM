The human GLUT1 (SLC2A1) membrane protein is the key glucose transporter in 
numerous cell types, including red cells, kidney, and blood-brain barrier cells. 
The expression level of this protein has a role in several diseases, including 
cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this work, to investigate a potential genetic 
modulation of the GLUT1 expression level, the protein level was measured in red 
cell membranes by flow cytometry, and the genetic background was analyzed by 
qPCR and luciferase assays. We found significant associations between red cell 
GLUT1 levels and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the coding SLC2A1 
gene, that in individuals with the minor alleles of rs841848, rs1385129, and 
rs11537641 had increased, while those having the variant rs841847 had decreased 
erythrocyte GLUT1 levels. In the luciferase reporter studies performed in 
HEK-293T and HepG2 cells, a similar SNP-dependent modulation was observed, and 
lower glucose, serum, and hypoxic condition had variable, cell- and SNP-specific 
effects on luciferase expression. These results should contribute to a more 
detailed understanding of the genetic background of membrane GLUT1 expression 
and its potential role in associated diseases.
