OBJECTIVES: The ability to determine the severity of renal fibrosis, which is 
involved in most chronic kidney diseases, may be beneficial for monitoring 
disease progression and management. The aim of this study was to assess a new 
method involving gold nanoparticles conjugated to an anti-collagen-I antibody 
(Co-I-AuNPs) as a computed tomography (CT) imaging contrast for the evaluation 
of renal fibrosis in situ.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gold nanoparticles conjugated to an anti-collagen-I 
antibody were prepared using gold chloride reduction with sodium citrate and 
coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and their size was determined by electron 
microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Anti-collagen-I antibody was then 
conjugated to PEG-SH/COOH on the AuNP surface. The success of antibody 
conjugation was tested in vitro using collagen-coated plate and mouse stenotic 
kidney sections and in vivo using micro-CT and multidetector CT imaging.
RESULTS: Bare AuNPs were 18.7 ± 0.6 nm and PEG-coated AuNPs were 45.3 ± 0.1 nm 
in size. In vitro, Co-I-AuNPs specifically bound to both a collagen-coated plate 
and mouse fibrotic kidneys. Furthermore, the stenotic mouse kidney showed 
increased Co-I-AuNPs retention compared with the contralateral kidney (59.3 ± 
5.1 vs 45.1 ± 1.7 HU, P = 0.05), which correlated with its collagen deposition. 
Micro-CT also detected gold signals in situ in the Co-I-AuNP-injected kidney, 
which colocalized with histological trichrome staining.
CONCLUSION: Gold nanoparticles conjugated to an anti-collagen-I antibody are 
able to visualize kidney fibrosis in vitro and in situ and may be useful for 
nondestructive quantification of tissue fibrosis.
