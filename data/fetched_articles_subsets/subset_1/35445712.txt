Asians are underrepresented across many omics databases, thereby limiting the 
potential of precision medicine in nearly 60% of the global population. As such, 
there is a pressing need for multi-omics derived quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
to fill the knowledge gap of complex traits in populations of Asian ancestry. 
Here, we provide the first blood-based multi-omics analysis of Asian pregnant 
women, constituting high-resolution genotyping (N = 1079), DNA methylation 
(N = 915) and transcriptome profiling (N = 238). Integrative omics analysis 
identified 219 154 CpGs associated with cis-DNA methylation QTLs (meQTLs) and 
3703 RNAs associated with cis-RNA expression QTLs (eQTLs). Ethnicity was the 
largest contributor of inter-individual variation across all omics datasets, 
with 2561 genes identified as hotspots of this variation; 395 of these hotspot 
genes also contained both ethnicity-specific eQTLs and meQTLs. Gene set 
enrichment analysis of these ethnicity QTL hotspots showed pathways involved in 
lipid metabolism, adaptive immune system and carbohydrate metabolism. Pathway 
validation by profiling the lipidome (~480 lipids) of antenatal plasma (N = 752) 
and placenta (N = 1042) in the same cohort showed significant lipid differences 
among Chinese, Malay and Indian women, validating ethnicity-QTL gene effects 
across different tissue types. To develop deeper insights into the complex 
traits and benefit future precision medicine research in Asian pregnant women, 
we developed iMOMdb, an open-access database.
