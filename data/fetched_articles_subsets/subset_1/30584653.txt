BACKGROUND: Recently, comprehensive genetic approaches for steroid-resistant 
nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been 
established, but causative gene mutations could not be detected in almost 70% of 
SRNS patients. Main reason for the low variant detection rate is that most of 
them are SRNS caused not by genetic but by immunological factors. But some of 
them are probably because of the difficulty of detecting copy number variations 
(CNVs) in causative genes by NGS.
METHODS: In this study, we performed two analytical methods of NGS 
data-dependent pair analysis and custom array comparative genomic hybridization 
(aCGH) in addition to NGS analysis in an infantile nephrotic syndrome case.
RESULTS: We detected only one known pathogenic heterozygous missense mutation in 
exon 7 of COQ6 c.782C > T, p.(Pro261Leu) by NGS. With pair analysis, 
heterozygous exon 1-2 deletion was suspected and was confirmed by custom aCGH. 
As a result, a small CNV was successfully detected in the COQ6 gene. Because we 
could detect variants in COQ6 and could start treatment by coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) 
in his very early stage of SRNS, the patient achieved complete remission.
CONCLUSIONS: These relatively novel methods should be adopted in cases with 
negative results in gene tests by NGS analysis. Especially, in cases with CoQ10 
deficiency, it is possible to delay initiating dialysis by starting treatment at 
their early stages.
