Objective- Atherosclerosis studies in Ldlr knockout mice require breeding to 
homozygosity and congenic status on C57BL6/J background, a process that is both 
time and resource intensive. We aimed to develop a new method for generating 
atherosclerosis through somatic deletion of Ldlr in livers of adult mice. 
Approach and Results- Overexpression of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9) is currently used to study atherosclerosis, which 
promotes degradation of LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) in the liver. We 
sought to determine whether CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats-associated 9) could also be used to generate atherosclerosis 
through genetic disruption of Ldlr in adult mice. We engineered adeno-associated 
viral (AAV) vectors expressing Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 and a guide RNA 
targeting the Ldlr gene (AAV-CRISPR). Both male and female mice received either 
(1) saline, (2) AAV-CRISPR, or (3) AAV-hPCSK9 (human PCSK9)-D374Y. A fourth 
group of germline Ldlr-KO mice was included for comparison. Mice were placed on 
a Western diet and followed for 20 weeks to assess plasma lipids, PCSK9 protein 
levels, atherosclerosis, and editing efficiency. Disruption of Ldlr with 
AAV-CRISPR was robust, resulting in severe hypercholesterolemia and 
atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. AAV-hPCSK9 also produced 
hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis as expected. Notable sexual dimorphism 
was observed, wherein AAV-CRISPR was superior for Ldlr removal in male mice, 
while AAV-hPCSK9 was more effective in female mice. Conclusions- This all-in-one 
AAV-CRISPR vector targeting Ldlr is an effective and versatile tool to model 
atherosclerosis with a single injection and provides a useful alternative to the 
use of germline Ldlr-KO mice.
