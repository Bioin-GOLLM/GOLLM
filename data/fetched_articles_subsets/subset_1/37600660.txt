The UBTF E210K neuroregression syndrome is a predominantly neurological disorder 
caused by recurrent de novo dominant variants in Upstream Binding Factor, that 
is, essential for transcription of the ribosomal RNA genes. This unusual form of 
ribosomopathy is characterized by a slow decline in cognition, behavior, and 
sensorimotor functioning during the critical period of development. UBTF (or 
UBF) is a multi-HMGB-box protein that acts both as an epigenetic factor to 
establish "open" chromatin on the ribosomal genes and as a basal transcription 
factor in their RNA Polymerase I transcription. Here we review the possible 
mechanistic connections between the UBTF variants, ribosomal RNA gene 
transcription and the neuroregression syndrome, and suggest that DNA topology 
may play an important role.
