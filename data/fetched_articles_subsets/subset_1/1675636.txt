We have identified a unique N-glycosylated Asn substitution for a Ser at 
position 434 of the A alpha chain of an abnormal fibrinogen designated 
fibrinogen Caracas II. This dysfibrinogen was characterized by impaired fibrin 
monomer aggregation. Since there were 4 Thr residues immediately following the 
mutation, a new Asn-X-Thr/Ser-type consensus sequence, Asn-Thr-Thr arose for 
N-glycosylation of the Asn. The extra oligosaccharide was found to consist 
mainly of a disialylated biantennary structure comprising 81.9%, while a neutral 
and a monosialylated biantennary oligosaccharide represented only 3.6% and 
14.5%, respectively. The mutation resides in the carboxyl-terminal region of the 
A alpha chain, which could fold back to form an extra small globular region 
located near the central region of the molecule (Erickson, H.P., and Fowler, 
W.E. (1983) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 408, 146-163; Weisel, H.P., Stauffacher, C.V., 
Bullitt, E., and Cohen, C. (1985) Science 230, 3124-3133). Therefore, the 
participation of this region, referred to as an additional central domain or an 
alpha domain, in fibrin gel formation is strongly implicated.
