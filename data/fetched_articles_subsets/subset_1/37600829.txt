BACKGROUND: Hyper-inflammatory immune response, a hallmark of severe COVID-19, 
is associated with increased mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) is a common manifestation. We undertook two phase I/II studies in five 
and then 16 subjects with severe/critical COVID-19 to assess the safety and 
preliminary efficacy of apoptotic cells (Allocetra™-OTS, Enlivex Therapeutics), 
a cellular immunomodulatory therapy that reprograms macrophages to reduce 
hyper-inflammatory response severity.
METHODS: Eligible patients presenting to the Emergency Room with severe COVID-19 
and respiratory dysfunction received one intravenous administration of 
Allocetra™-OTS and were monitored for adverse events (AEs) for 28 days. The 
primary aim was to determine the safety profile of treatment; secondary aims 
were recovery from ARDS, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length-of-stay, 
and mortality. Immune modulator markers were measured to elucidate the mechanism 
of action of Allocetra™-OTS.
RESULTS: 21 patients with severe-critical COVID-19 of Gamma, Alpha and Delta 
variants, were treated with a single dose of apoptotic cells. 19/21 patients had 
mild-to-severe ARDS at presentation. Median age was 53 years, 16/21 were males, 
16/21 were overweight/obese. No serious related adverse events (SAEs) were 
reported. All 21 study subjects survived to day 28 (end of study); 19/21 
recovered completely. Comparable mortality rates at the hospital were 3.8%-8.9% 
for age- and gender-matched patients, and 39%-55% for critical patients. 
Recovering patients exhibited rapid ARDS resolution and parallel resolution of 
inflammation markers and elevated cytokines/chemokines.
CONCLUSION: In patients with severe/critical COVID-19 associated with ARDS, 
Allocetra™-OTS was safe, well-tolerated, and showed promising results for 
resolution of respiratory failure and inflammation.
