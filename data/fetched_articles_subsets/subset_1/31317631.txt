GATA-3 regulates the differentiation, proliferation, survival, and function of 
peripheral T cells and their thymic progenitors. Recent findings, reviewed here, 
not only implicate GATA-3 in the pathogenesis of molecularly, genetically, and 
clinically distinct T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, but also have 
significant diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.
