Molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 help fold and activate proteins in 
important signal transduction pathways that include DNA damage response (DDR). 
Previous studies have suggested that the levels of the mammalian APE2 
exonuclease, a protein critical for DNA repair, may be dependent on chaperone 
activity. In this study, we demonstrate that the budding yeast Apn2 exonuclease 
interacts with molecular chaperones Ssa1 and Hsp82 and the co-chaperone Ydj1. 
Although Apn2 does not display a binding preference for any specific cytosolic 
Hsp70 or Hsp90 paralog, Ssa1 is unable to support Apn2 stability when present as 
the sole Ssa in the cell. Demonstrating conservation of this mechanism, the 
exonuclease APE2 also binds to Hsp70 and Hsp90 in mammalian cells. Inhibition of 
chaperone function via specific small molecule inhibitors results in a rapid 
loss of APE2 in a range of cancer cell lines. Taken together, these data 
identify APE2 and Apn2 as clients of the chaperone system in yeast and mammalian 
cells and suggest that chaperone inhibition may form the basis of novel 
anticancer therapies that target APE2-mediated processes.
