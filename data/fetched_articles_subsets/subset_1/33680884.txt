BACKGROUND: Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is a rare disorder 
being classified as Kallmann syndrome (KS). The present study was conducted to 
study the genotype and relative proportion of different genetic mutations in IHH 
and to assess its correlation with phenotype.
METHODS: Eleven consecutive subjects presenting to the Department of 
Endocrinology were retrospectively analyzed during May 2017 to December 2018 
with IHH. Phenotypic features and hormonal studies were analyzed along with 
clinical exome by targeted gene sequencing (Next generation sequencing). 
Thirty-nine relevant genes were tested in the analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 11 patients studied, five had KS and six had nIHH. At diagnosis, 
mean chronological age was 25 years. There were associated anomalies in KS group 
including bimanual synkinesia (n=2), unilateral renal agenesis (n=1) and 
submucosal cleft palate (n=1). Absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulb/sulci 
was found in 4/5 patients with KS. Genetic mutations in KAL1, CHD7, FGFR1, 
GNRHR, PROKR2, HS6ST1 genes were found in nine of the eleven subjects. Of the 
five subjects with KS, two had mutations in KAL1 gene. Two siblings who had 
bimanual synkinesia had CHD7 mutation. The genotype of nIHH subjects (n=6) was 
more heterogeneous.
CONCLUSION: This study analyzed the clinical, endocrinological, and genetic 
features in IHH patients. Detectable genetic mutations were seen in a large 
proportion of cases. A considerable heterogeneity was seen in the genotype with 
new variants detected. A definite correlation of phenotype-genotype was not 
possible, and significant overlap was seen between CHD7 and KAl1, and FGFR1 
phenotypes.
