BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determine whether larger 
abdominopelvic abscess drains reduce the time required for abscess resolution or 
the probability of tube occlusion.
METHODS: 144 consecutive patients who underwent abscess drainage at a single 
institution were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Larger initial drain size did not reduce drainage time, drain 
occlusion, or drain exchanges (P > .05). Subgroup analysis did not find any type 
of collection that benefitted from larger drains. A multivariate model 
predicting drainage time showed that large collections (>200 mL) required 
16 days longer drainage time than small collections (<50 mL). Collections with a 
fistula to bowel required 17 days longer drainage time than collections without 
a fistula. Initial drain size and the viscosity of the fluid in the collection 
had no significant effect on drainage time in the multivariate model.
CONCLUSIONS: 8 F drains are adequate for initial drainage of most serous and 
serosanguineous collections. 10 F drains are adequate for initial drainage of 
most purulent or bloody collections.
