PURPOSE: Recent studies have expanded the scope of research on the 
Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet beyond 
its impact on cognitive performance. These investigations have specifically 
explored its potential to provide protection against cardiometabolic diseases 
and associated risk factors, including obesity and dyslipidemia.
METHODS: We systematically summarized and evaluated all existing observational 
and trial evidence for the MIND diet in relation to cardiometabolic diseases and 
their risk factors in adults. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library 
databases were systematically searched to extract original studies on humans 
published until September 2023, without date restrictions. A total of 491 
studies were initially retrieved, out of which 23 met the eligibility criteria 
and were included in the final review. Duplicated and irrelevant studies were 
screened out by five independent reviewers using the Rayyan platform. Quality 
assessment was ascertained using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational 
studies and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB 2) for randomized trials.
RESULTS: Across the different study designs, the MIND diet was generally 
associated with an improvement in anthropometric measures and other 
cardiometabolic outcomes, such as blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid 
profile, inflammation and stroke. The effects of the MIND eating pattern on some 
cardiovascular diseases are less conclusive.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review support the recommendation of 
the MIND diet as a strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in adults. Further 
well-designed and long-term studies are warranted.
