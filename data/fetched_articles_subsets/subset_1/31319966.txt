OBJECTIVES: Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(EGFR-TKIs) represent the first-line treatment for patients with advanced EGFR 
mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Afatinib is a second-generation 
EGFR-TKI with excellent therapeutic effects. However, severe diarrhea and skin 
disorders are observed at high frequencies, often leading to treatment 
interruption because of low quality of life (QOL). The relationship between 
individual variations and the onset of these side effects remains to be 
elucidated. This study aimed to reveal the association among these side effects, 
pharmacokinetics, and related genetic polymorphisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 33 patients were recruited between July 2014 
and June 2017. Afatinib plasma concentrations were measured at day 9 when the 
concentrations reached a steady state (early phase) and when the prescription 
dose was stable for more than 1 month (stable phase). We analyzed single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 
(ABCB1), ABCG2, and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3.
RESULTS: The incidences of both diarrhea and acneiform eruption were greater 
than 80%. Afatinib plasma concentration and the severity of diarrhea in the 
early phase were correlated. Pharmacokinetics-related genetic polymorphisms 
influenced the severity of diarrhea. Particularly, the afatinib plasma 
concentration was higher and diarrhea was more severe in patients carrying the A 
allele of ABCG2 C421A. Onset of side effects, genetic polymorphisms, and 
diarrhea in the maintenance phase or acneiform eruption in the early or 
maintenance phases were not correlated. The severity of diarrhea is influenced 
by drug plasma concentrations in the early phase and genetic polymorphisms 
related to afatinib pharmacokinetics.
CONCLUSION: Particular genetic polymorphisms can be screened before afatinib 
administration and the dose adapted to individual patients can be controlled, 
leading to reduced side effects, improved QOL, and better patient compliance to 
maintain the therapeutic effects.
