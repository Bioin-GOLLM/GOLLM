BACKGROUND: Lafora disease (LD) is a rare fatal autosomal recessive form of 
progressive myoclonus epilepsy. It affects previously healthy children or 
adolescents, causing pharmacoresistant epilepsy, myoclonus and severe 
psychomotor deterioration. This work aims to describe the clinical course of LD 
and identify predictors of outcome by means of a prognostic systematic review 
with individual participant data meta-analysis.
METHODS: A search was conducted on MEDLINE and Embase with no restrictions on 
publication date. Only studies reporting genetically confirmed LD cases were 
included. Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to assess probability of death and loss 
of autonomy. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models with mixed 
effects (clustered survival data) were performed to evaluate prognostic factors.
RESULTS: Seventy-three papers describing 298 genetically confirmed LD cases were 
selected. Mean age at disease onset was 13.4 years (SD 3.7), with 9.1% 
aged ≥ 18 years. Overall survival rates in 272 cases were 93% [95% CI 89-96] at 
5 years, 62% [95% CI 54-69] at 10 years and 57% [95% CI 49-65] at 15 years. 
Median survival time was 11 years. The probability of loss of autonomy in 110 
cases was 45% [95% CI 36-55] at 5 years, 75% [95% CI 66-84] at 10 years, and 83% 
[95% CI 74-90] at 15 years. Median loss of autonomy time was 6 years. Asian 
origin and age at onset < 18 years emerged as negative prognostic factors, while 
type of mutated gene and symptoms at onset were not related to survival or 
disability.
CONCLUSIONS: This study documented that half of patients survived at least 
11 years. The notion of actual survival rate and prognostic factors is crucial 
to design studies on the effectiveness of upcoming new disease-modifying 
therapies.
