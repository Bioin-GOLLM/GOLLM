MEK inhibition is of interest in cancer drug development, but clinical activity 
in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been limited. Preclinical studies 
demonstrated Wnt pathway overexpression in KRAS-mutant cell lines resistant to 
the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. The combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin 
A, a noncanonical Wnt pathway modulator, demonstrated antitumor activity in mCRC 
patient-derived xenografts. To translate these results, we conducted a NCI 
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-approved multicenter phase I/IB trial 
(NCT02188264) of the combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A. Patients with 
advanced solid malignancies were treated with the combination of oral 
selumetinib and cyclosporin A in the dose escalation phase, followed by an 
expansion cohort of irinotecan and oxaliplatin-refractory mCRC. The expansion 
cohort utilized a single-agent selumetinib "run-in" to evaluate FZD2 biomarker 
upregulation and KRAS-WT and KRAS-MT stratification to identify any potential 
predictors of efficacy. Twenty and 19 patients were enrolled in dose escalation 
and expansion phases, respectively. The most common adverse events and grade 3/4 
toxicities were rash, hypertension, and edema. Three dose-limiting toxicities 
(grade 3 hypertension, rash, and increased creatinine) were reported. The MTD 
was selumetinib 75 mg twice daily and cyclosporin A 2 mg/kg twice daily on a 
28-day cycle. KRAS stratification did not identify any differences in response 
between KRAS-WT and KRAS-MT cancers. Two partial responses, 18 stable disease, 
and 10 progressive disease responses were observed. Combination selumetinib and 
cyclosporin A is well tolerated, with evidence of activity in mCRC. Future 
strategies for concept development include identifying better predictors of 
efficacy and improved Wnt pathway modulation.Significance: These findings 
translate preclinical studies combining selumetinib and cyclosporin into a phase 
I first-in-human clinical trial of such a combination in patients with advanced 
solid malignancies. Cancer Res; 78(18); 5398-407. ©2018 AACR.
