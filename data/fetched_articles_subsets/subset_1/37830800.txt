The study provides important insights into the immunogenicity and efficacy of a 
tetravalent protein subunit vaccine candidate against severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The vaccine induced both humoral and 
cellular immune responses in nonhuman primates with controlled SIVagm infection 
and was able to generate Omicron variant-specific antibodies without 
specifically vaccinating with Omicron. These findings suggest that the 
tetravalent composition of the vaccine candidate could provide broad protection 
against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants while minimizing the risk of immune escape 
and the emergence of new variants. Additionally, the use of rhesus macaques with 
controlled SIVsab infection may better represent vaccine immunogenicity in 
humans with chronic viral diseases, highlighting the importance of preclinical 
animal models in vaccine development. Overall, the study provides valuable 
information for the development and implementation of coronavirus disease 2019 
vaccines, particularly for achieving global vaccine equity and addressing 
emerging variants.
