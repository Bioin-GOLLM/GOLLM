Activity of nonmuscle myosin II is regulated by phosphorylation of its 
regulatory light chain (MRLC). Phosphoryration of MRLC at both Thr18 and Ser19 
(diphosphorylation) results in higher MgATPase activity and in promotion of the 
assembly of myosin II filaments than does that of MRLC at Ser19 
(monophosphorylation) in vitro. To determine the roles of the diphosphorylated 
MRLC in vivo, we transfected three kinds of MRLC mutants, unphosphorylated, 
monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated forms (MRLC2(T18AS19A), substitution of 
both Ser19 and Thr18 by Ala; MRLC2(T18AS19D), Ser19 by Asp and Thr18 by Ala; and 
MRLC2(T18DS19D), both Ser19 and Thr18 by Asp, respectively), into HeLa cells. 
Cells overexpressing the mutant MRLC2(T18DS19D) contained a larger number of 
actin filament bundles than did those overexpressing the mutant MRLC2(T18AS19D). 
Moreover, cells overexpressing the nonphosphorylatable mutant MRLC2(T18AS19A) 
showed a decrease in the number of actin filament bundles. Taken together, our 
data suggest that diphosphorylation of MRLC plays an important role in 
regulating actin filament assembly and reorganization in nonmuscle cells.
