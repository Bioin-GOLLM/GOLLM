Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) is caused by mutations in a key enzyme of the 
mevalonate-cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, leading to recurrent 
autoinflammatory disease characterised by enhanced release of interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β). It is currently believed that the inflammatory phenotype of MKD is 
triggered by temperature-sensitive loss of mevalonate kinase activity and 
reduced biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids required for the prenylation of small 
GTPase proteins. However, previous studies have not clearly shown any change in 
protein prenylation in patient cells under normal conditions. With lymphoblast 
cell lines from two compound heterozygous MKD patients, we used a highly 
sensitive in vitro prenylation assay, together with quantitative mass 
spectrometry, to reveal a subtle accumulation of unprenylated Rab GTPases in 
cells cultured for 3 days or more at 40 °C compared with 37 °C. This included a 
200% increase in unprenylated Rab7A, Rab14 and Rab1A. Inhibition of sterol 
regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activation by fatostatin led to more 
pronounced accumulation of unprenylated Rab proteins in MKD cells but not parent 
cells, suggesting that cultured MKD cells may partially overcome the loss of 
isoprenoid lipids by SREBP-mediated upregulation of enzymes required for 
isoprenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, while inhibition of Rho/Rac/Rap 
prenylation promoted the release of IL-1β, specific inhibition of Rab 
prenylation by NE10790 had no effect in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
or human THP-1 monocytic cells. These studies demonstrate for the first time 
that mutations in mevalonate kinase can lead to a mild, temperature-induced 
defect in the prenylation of small GTPases, but that loss of prenylated Rab 
GTPases is not the cause of enhanced IL-1β release in MKD.
