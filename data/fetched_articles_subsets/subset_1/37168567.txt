Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the most common infection among people with 
HIV (PWH). Mtb disease-associated inflammation could affect HIV-directed immune 
responses in PWH. We show that HIV antibodies are broader and more potent in PWH 
in the presence as compared to the absence of Mtb disease. With co-existing Mtb 
disease, the virus in PWH also encounters unique antibody selection pressure. 
The Mtb-linked HIV antibody enhancement associates with specific mediators 
important for B cell and antibody development. This Mtb humoral augmentation 
does not occur due to cross-reactivity, a generalized increase in all 
antibodies, or differences in duration or amount of antigen exposure. We 
speculate that the co-localization of Mtb and HIV in lymphatic tissues leads to 
the emergence of potent HIV antibodies. PWH's Mtb disease status has 
implications for the future use of HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies as 
prophylaxis or treatment and the induction of better humoral immunity.
