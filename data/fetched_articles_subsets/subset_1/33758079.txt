Palmitoylation is the most common post-translational lipid modification in the 
brain; however, the role of palmitoylation and palmitoylating enzymes in the 
nervous system remains elusive. One of these enzymes, Zdhhc5, has previously 
been shown to regulate synapse plasticity. Here, we report that Zdhhc5 is also 
essential for the formation of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses both in 
vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate in vitro that this is dependent on the 
enzymatic activity of Zdhhc5, its localization at the plasma membrane and its 
C-terminal domain, which has been shown to be truncated in a patient with 
schizophrenia. Loss of Zdhhc5 in mice results in a decrease in the density of 
excitatory hippocampal synapses accompanied by alterations in membrane 
capacitance and synaptic currents, consistent with an overall decrease in spine 
number and silent synapses. These findings reveal an important role for Zdhhc5 
in the formation and/or maintenance of excitatory synapses.
