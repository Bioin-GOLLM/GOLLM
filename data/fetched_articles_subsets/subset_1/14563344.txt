The 2373insG mutation in the MYBPC3 gene is a founder mutation, which accounts 
for nearly one-fourth of the HCM cases in the Netherlands.

AIMS: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in genes that 
encode sarcomeric proteins. In this study we investigated the involvement of the 
sarcomeric myosin binding protein C in the Dutch HCM population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We initially screened 22 Dutch index patients for mutations 
in the MYBPC3 gene, which revealed four different mutations in 14 patients. The 
2373insG mutation was identified in 10 apparently unrelated patients. A 
subsequent screening for the 2373insG mutation in a group of another 237 
unrelated HCM patients revealed 50 additional carriers of the same genetic 
defect. Genotyping with polymorphic repeat markers and intragenic SNPs of the 60 
Dutch as well as two German and five North American 2373insG carriers indicated 
they all share the same haplotype.
CONCLUSION: The 2373insG mutation accounts for almost one-fourth of all HCM 
cases in the Netherlands (60/259), which is predominantly present in the 
northwestern part of the country (22/66) and is a founder mutation probably 
originating from the Netherlands.
