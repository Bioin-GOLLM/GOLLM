The functions of proteins are often realized through their mutual interactions. 
Determining a relative transformation for a pair of proteins and their 
conformations which form a stable complex, reproducible in nature, is known as 
docking. It is an important step in drug design, structure determination, and 
understanding function and structure relationships. In this paper, we extend our 
nonuniform fast Fourier transform-based docking algorithm to include an adaptive 
search phase (both translational and rotational) and thereby speed up its 
execution. We have also implemented a multithreaded version of the adaptive 
docking algorithm for even faster execution on multicore machines. We call this 
protein-protein docking code F2Dock (F2 = Fast Fourier). We have calibrated 
F2Dock based on an extensive experimental study on a list of benchmark complexes 
and conclude that F2Dock works very well in practice. Though all docking results 
reported in this paper use shape complementarity and Coulombic-potential-based 
scores only, F2Dock is structured to incorporate Lennard-Jones potential and 
reranking docking solutions based on desolvation energy .
