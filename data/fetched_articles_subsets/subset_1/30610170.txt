Regulation of plasma membrane (PM) protein abundance by selective endocytosis is 
critical for cellular adaptation to stress or changing nutrient availability. 
One example involves rapid endocytic turnover of Mup1, a yeast methionine 
transporter, in response to increased methionine availability. Here, we report 
that methionine triggers rapid translocation of the ubiquitin ligase adaptor 
Art1 to the PM and dephosphorylation of Art1 at specific threonine residues. 
This methionine-induced dephosphorylation of Art1 is mediated by Ppz 
phosphatases, and analysis of phosphomimetic and phosphorylation-defective 
variants of Art1 indicates that these events toggle Art1 recognition of Mup1 at 
the PM. Importantly, we find that Ppz phosphatases are dispensable for Art1 PM 
translocation, but are required for Art1 interaction with Mup1. Based on our 
findings, we propose that methionine influx triggers Art1 translocation to the 
PM, followed by Ppz-mediated dephosphorylation which promotes cargo recognition 
at the PM.
