We report monozygous triplets affected with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa 
(DEB). The female triplets were delivered by Caesarean section and skin 
fragility of each child, which was partly induced by trauma, was apparent from 
the third to fourth day of life. Clinically, the triplets were equally affected. 
Mutation analysis in this family revealed a novel recessively expressed glycine 
substitution, G2031S, in exon 73 of the collagen VII gene COL7A1. Most glycine 
substitutions in this gene region encoding for the triple helical domain of 
collagen VII are associated with milder, dominantly inherited phenotypes. By 
contrast, the novel point mutation of this study is clinically silent in the 
heterozygous state and leads to a severe DEB subtype when homozygous.
