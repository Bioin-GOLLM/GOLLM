Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory 
dysfunction and polycystic ovaries1, and is often accompanied by insulin 
resistance2. The mechanism of ovulatory dysfunction and insulin resistance in 
PCOS remains elusive, thus limiting the development of therapeutics. Improved 
metabolic health is associated with a relatively high microbiota gene content 
and increased microbial diversity3,4. This study aimed to investigate the impact 
of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on the regulation of PCOS-associated 
ovarian dysfunction and insulin resistance. Here, we report that Bacteroides 
vulgatus was markedly elevated in the gut microbiota of individuals with PCOS, 
accompanied by reduced glycodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
levels. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from women with PCOS or B. 
vulgatus-colonized recipient mice resulted in increased disruption of ovarian 
functions, insulin resistance, altered bile acid metabolism, reduced 
interleukin-22 secretion and infertility. Mechanistically, glycodeoxycholic acid 
induced intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cell IL-22 secretion through GATA 
binding protein 3, and IL-22 in turn improved the PCOS phenotype. This finding 
is consistent with the reduced levels of IL-22 in individuals with PCOS. This 
study suggests that modifying the gut microbiota, altering bile acid metabolism 
and/or increasing IL-22 levels may be of value for the treatment of PCOS.
