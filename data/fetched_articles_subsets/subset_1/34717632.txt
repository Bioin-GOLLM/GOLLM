BACKGROUND: Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) have been used in various 
fields of tissue engineering because of their promising therapeutic efficacy. 
However, the stemness of hADSCs cannot be maintained for long durations, and 
their therapeutic cellular functions, such as paracrine factor secretion 
decrease during long-term cell culture. To facilitate the use of 
long-term-cultured hADSCs (L-ADSCs), we designed a novel therapeutic 
anti-senescence ion-delivering nanocarrier (AIN) that is capable of recovering 
the therapeutic properties of L-ADSCs. In the present study, we introduced a 
low-pH-responsive ion nanocarrier capable of delivering transition metal ions 
that can enhance angiogenic paracrine factor secretion from L-ADSCs. The AINs 
were delivered to L-ADSCs in an intracellular manner through endocytosis.
RESULTS: Low pH conditions within the endosomes induced the release of 
transition metal ions (Fe) into the L-ADSCs that in turn caused a mild elevation 
in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This mild elevation in ROS 
levels induced a downregulation of senescence-related gene expression and an 
upregulation of stemness-related gene expression. The angiogenic paracrine 
factor secretion from L-ADSCs was significantly enhanced, and this was evidenced 
by the observed therapeutic efficacy in response to treatment of a wound-closing 
mouse model with conditioned medium obtained from AIN-treated L-ADSCs that was 
similar to that observed in response to treatment with short-term-cultured 
adipose-derived stem cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a novel method and strategy for cell-based 
tissue regeneration that can overcome the limitations of the low stemness and 
therapeutic efficacy of stem cells that occurs during long-term cell culture.
