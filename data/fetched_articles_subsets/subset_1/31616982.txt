To address the need for more meaningful biomarkers of tauopathies, we have 
developed an ultrasensitive tau seed amplification assay (4R RT-QuIC) for the 
4-repeat (4R) tau aggregates of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 
corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and other diseases with 4R tauopathy. The assay 
detected seeds in 106-109-fold dilutions of 4R tauopathy brain tissue but was 
orders of magnitude less responsive to brain with other types of tauopathy, such 
as from Alzheimer's disease cases. The analytical sensitivity for synthetic 4R 
tau fibrils was ~ 50 fM or 2 fg/sample. A novel dimension of this tau RT-QuIC 
testing was the identification of three disease-associated classes of 4R tau 
seeds; these classes were revealed by conformational variations in the in vitro 
amplified tau fibrils as detected by thioflavin T fluorescence amplitudes and 
FTIR spectroscopy. Tau seeds were detected in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) from all neuropathologically confirmed PSP and CBD cases but not in 
controls. CSF from living subjects had weaker seeding activities; however, mean 
assay responses for cases clinically diagnosed as PSP and CBD/corticobasal 
syndrome were significantly higher than those from control cases. Altogether, 4R 
RT-QuIC provides a practical cell-free method of detecting and subtyping 
pathologic 4R tau aggregates as biomarkers.
