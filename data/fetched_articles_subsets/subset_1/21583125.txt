In the title compound, C(16)H(15)N(3)O(2)·H(2)O, the two benzene rings and the 
triazole ring lie almost in the same plane, the triazole ring forming dihedral 
angles of 5.07 (9) and 5.80 (8)° with the benzene rings. In the crystal, there 
are three relatively strong inter-molecular O-H⋯N and N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, 
which lead to the formation of a one-dimensional double chain running parallel 
to the a axis. Weak π-π inter-actions between the benzene rings of neighboring 
chains with a centroid-centroid distance of 3.893 (4) Å result in the formation 
of layers parallel to the ac plane.
