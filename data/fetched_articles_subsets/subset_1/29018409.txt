Heritable susceptibility of the autoimmune disorder, type 1 diabetes (T1D), only 
partially equates for the incidence of the disease. Significant evidence 
attributes several environmental stressors, such as vitamin D deficiency, gut 
microbiome, dietary antigens, and most notably virus infections in triggering 
the onset of T1D in these genetically susceptible individuals. Extensive 
epidemiological and clinical studies have provided credibility to this causal 
relationship. Infection by the enterovirus, coxsackievirus B, has been closely 
associated with onset of T1D and is considered a significant etiological agent 
for disease induction. Recognition of viral antigens via innate 
pathogen-recognition receptors induce inflammatory events which contribute to 
autoreactivity of pancreatic self-antigens and ultimately the destruction of 
insulin-secreting beta cells. The activation of these specific innate pathways 
and expression of inflammatory molecules, including type I and III interferon, 
prime the immune system to elicit either a protective regulatory response or a 
diabetogenic effector response. Therefore, sensing of viral antigens by retinoic 
acid-inducible gene I-like receptors and toll-like receptors may be detrimental 
to inducing autoreactivity initiated by viral stress and resulting in T1D.
