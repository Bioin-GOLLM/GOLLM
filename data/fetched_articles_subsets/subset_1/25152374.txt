PTEN is post-translationally modified by ubiquitin via association with multiple 
E3 ubiquitin ligases, including NEDD4-1, XIAP, and WWP2. Despite the rapid 
progress made in researching the impact of ubiquitination on PTEN function, our 
understanding remains fragmented. Building on the previously observed 
interaction between SIPL1 and PTEN, we report here that SIPL1 promotes PTEN 
polyubiquitination via lysine 48 (K48)-independent polyubiquitin chains. 
Substitution of the K48 residue of ubiquitin with arginine (R) enhanced 
SIPL1-mediated PTEN polyubiquitination. In contrast, the K63R substitution 
significantly reduced it. The ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain is required for 
SIPL1-induced PTEN polyubiquitination. This post-translational modification 
promoted the association of SIPL1 with PTEN. Elevated amounts of the SIPL1/PTEN 
complex were precipitated in 293T cells co-transfected with PTEN, SIPL1, and 
ubiquitin compared to cells co-transfected with SIPL1 and PTEN only. 
Additionally, formation of the SIPL1/PTEN complex was inhibited when either 
lysine-less (K0) ubiquitin or K63R ubiquitin was co-transfected together with 
SIPL1+PTEN. The PTEN component in the SIPL1/PTEN complex contained polyubiquitin 
chains. The ubiquitination reaction may play a structural role, stabilizing the 
SIPL1/PTEN complex, as a ubiquitin binding-defective SIPL1 mutant (TFLV) is 
proficient in PTEN association. Collectively, we demonstrate that SIPL1 binds 
PTEN and enhances PTEN polyubiquitination which in turn promotes the interaction 
between SIPL1 and PTEN.
