Dendritic spines are the central postsynaptic machinery that determines synaptic 
function. The F-actin within dendritic spines regulates their dynamic formation 
and elimination. Rai14 is an F-actin-regulating protein with a membrane-shaping 
function. Here, we identified the roles of Rai14 for the regulation of dendritic 
spine dynamics associated with stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. 
Rai14-deficient neurons exhibit reduced dendritic spine density in the Rai14+/- 
mouse brain, resulting in impaired functional synaptic activity. Rai14 was 
protected from degradation by complex formation with Tara, and accumulated in 
the dendritic spine neck, thereby enhancing spine maintenance. Concurrently, 
Rai14 deficiency in mice altered gene expression profile relevant to depressive 
conditions and increased depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, Rai14 expression 
was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse stress model, which was 
blocked by antidepressant treatment. Thus, we propose that Rai14-dependent 
regulation of dendritic spines may underlie the plastic changes of neuronal 
connections relevant to depressive-like behaviors.
