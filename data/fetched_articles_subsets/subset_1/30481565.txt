Tumors, including melanomas, frequently show an accelerated glucose metabolism. 
Mutations in the v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), detected 
in about 50% of all melanomas, result in further enhancement of glycolysis. 
Therefore anti-metabolic substances might enhance the impact of RAF inhibitors. 
We have identified the two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
diclofenac and lumiracoxib being able to restrict energy metabolism in human 
melanoma cells by targeting lactate release and oxidative phosphorylation 
(OXPHOS). In combination with the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib strong synergism was 
observed: Diclofenac as well as lumiracoxib increased the anti-glycolytic impact 
of vemurafenib and prevented RAF-inhibitor induced metabolic reprogramming 
towards OXPHOS. Consequently, both NSAIDs sensitized melanoma cells to 
vemurafenib triggered proliferation arrest and enhanced the anti-tumor effect of 
RAF inhibitors from cytostatic to cytotoxic. Furthermore the addition of NSAIDs 
delayed the onset of RAF inhibitor resistance, most likely by counteracting the 
upregulation of MITF. Our data suggest that selected NSAIDs could be a promising 
combination partner for MAPK pathway inhibitors for the treatment of BRAFV600E 
mutated melanomas.
