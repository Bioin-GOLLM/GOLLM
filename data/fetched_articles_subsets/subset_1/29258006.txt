BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Elevated urinary 11-dehydro thromboxane B2 (TxB2), a 
measure of thromboxane A2 formation in vivo, predicts future atherothrombotic 
events. To further understand this relationship, the genetic determinants of 
11-dehydro TxB2 and their associations with cardiovascular morbidity were 
investigated in this study.
METHODS: Genome-wide and targeted genetic association studies of urinary 
11-dehydro TxB2 were conducted in 806 Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial 
(ASCOT) participants.
RESULTS: The strongest associations were in PPARGC1B (rs4235745, rs32582, 
rs10515638) and CNTN4 (rs10510230, rs4684343), these 5 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were independently associated with 11-dehydro TxB2 
formation. Haplotypes of 11-dehydro TxB2 increasing alleles for both PPARGC1B 
and CNTN4 were significantly associated with 11-dehydro TxB2, explaining 5.2% 
and 4.5% of the variation in the whole cohort, and 8.8% and 7.9% in participants 
not taking aspirin, respectively. In a second ASCOT population (n = 6199), 
addition of these 5 SNPs significantly improved the covariate-only Cox 
proportional hazards model for cardiovascular events (chisq = 14.7, p=0.01). Two 
of the risk alleles associated with increased urinary 11-dehydro TxB2 were 
individually associated with greater incidences of cardiovascular events - 
rs10515638 (HR = 1.31, p=0.01) and rs10510230 (HR = 1.25, p=0.007); effect sizes 
were larger in those not taking aspirin.
CONCLUSIONS: PPARGC1B and CNTN4 genotypes are associated with elevated 
thromboxane A2 formation and with an excess of cardiovascular events. Aspirin 
appears to blunt these associations. If specific protection of PPARGC1B and 
CNTN4 variant carriers by aspirin is confirmed by additional studies, PPARGC1B 
and CNTN4 genotyping could potentially assist in clinical decision making 
regarding the use of aspirin in primary prevention.
