BACKGROUND: The results of studies on the association of ecNOS polymorphisms and 
vascular diseases are inconsistent. To explore the nature of this interaction in 
the absence of confounding factors, such as smoking, we measured ecNOS mRNA, 
protein, and enzyme activity in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) with and without ecNOS polymorphisms.
METHODS: We identified a T(-786)-->C polymorphism in the promoter region, the 
intron 4 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), the E298A polymorphism in 
exon 7, and the G10-T polymorphism in intron 23 of the ecNOS gene in the DNA 
from 43 human umbilical cords. We measured ecNOS and GAPDH mRNA from the 
cultured HUVECs by reverse transcription-PCR and ecNOS protein and enzyme 
activity by Western blotting (as ratio to positive control band) and by 
determining the conversion of [(3)H]arginine to [(3)H]citrulline, respectively.
RESULTS: The T(-786)-->C polymorphism showed the same allelic distribution as 
the intron 4 VNTR. Mean (SD) ecNOS protein from the cultured HUVECs was 
significantly lower in the 4a/4b genotype [0.84 (1.23); n = 9] of the intron 4 
VNTR than in the 4b/4b genotype [2.14 (2.26); n = 34; P = 0.0300]. The enzyme 
activity was also significantly lower in the 4a/4b genotype [0.84 (0.21) 
pmol.min(-1).mg protein(-1); n = 9] than in the 4b/4b genotype [1.07 (0.31) 
pmol.min(-1).mg protein(-1); n = 34; P = 0.0197].
CONCLUSIONS: ecNOS gene expression, protein concentrations, and enzyme activity 
are genotype-dependent in HUVECs. The intron 4 VNTR has a consistent influence 
that may be mediated by the T(-786)-->C polymorphism in the promoter region.
