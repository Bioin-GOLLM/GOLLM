OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the association between the 
single-nucleotide polymorphism rs9939609 in the FTO gene and 
homeostatic/non-homeostatic eating behavior patterns in Chilean children.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 258 children (44% female; 8-14 
y of age). Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, Z-score of height, body 
mass index, and waist circumference) were performed. Eating behavior was 
assessed using the Eating in Absence of Hunger Questionnaire; the Child Eating 
Behavior Questionnaire; the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, and the Food 
Reinforcement Value Questionnaire. Genotype of rs9939609 was determined by a 
Taqman assay. Association of rs9939609 with eating behavior was assessed using 
non-parametric tests.
RESULTS: Allelic frequencies of rs9939609 were estimated as 77% for the A allele 
and 23% for the T allele. We found that normal-weight girl A carriers had higher 
scores of Satiety Responsiveness and Slowness on the Eating subscale. 
Normal-weight boy A carriers showed significantly higher scores on the Negative 
Affect and lower scores of the Desire to Drink subscale. In overweight children, 
A carriers showed higher scores on the Food Responsiveness, Emotional 
Overeating, Enjoyment of Food, and Food Choice subscales and lower scores on the 
Satiety- Responsiveness and Slowness in Eating subscales. In obese children, we 
found higher scores on the Cognitive Restrained subscale and lower Food Choice.
CONCLUSION: The rs9939609 A allele of the FTO gene is associated with eating 
behavior traits and may predispose to obesity.
