BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes have been associated 
with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Although statins have been associated 
with an increased risk of ICH, meta-analyses have not consistently shown a 
statin-induced risk of ICH. Here, we test whether hypercholesterolemia (HC) and 
ApoE polymorphisms affect the risk of ICH by statin use.
METHODS: The Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Stroke 
(GERFHS) study is a prospective, demographically matched case-control study of 
ICH. A similar study of ICH, Genetic Risks for Medication-Related Hemorrhagic 
Stroke (GOCHA), was used as a replication cohort. Subjects were classified as 
normocholesterolemia, HC without statin use, and HC with statin use. Statistical 
comparisons were performed using Fisher exact test, Ï‡2 tests, and the 
Breslow-Day test.
RESULTS: The discovery cohort consisted of 558 ICH cases and 1444 controls, and 
the replication cohort consisted of 1020 ICH cases and 382 controls. The 
association of lower risk for HC was not attenuated by statin use. Statin use 
was observed to confer a higher risk for lobar ICH in those carrying ApoE4/E4 
and ApoE2/E4 genotypes in both discovery and replication cohorts, and a test for 
interaction showed a trend towards significance (P=0.11 for statin and 
ApoE4/E4).
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use does not seem to attenuate the association of HC with 
decreased risk for nonlobar ICH. Our data support a gene-by-drug effect for 
lobar ICH, but larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the association before 
any clinical change is warranted.
