CPAP is required for centriole elongation during S/G2 phase, but the role of 
CPAP in mitosis is incompletely understood. Here, we show that CPAP maintains 
spindle pole integrity through its phosphorylation by Aurora-A during mitosis. 
Depletion of CPAP induced a prolonged delay in mitosis, pericentriolar material 
(PCM) dispersion, and multiple mitotic abnormalities. Further studies 
demonstrated that CPAP directly interacts with and is phosphorylated by Aurora-A 
at serine 467 during mitosis. Interestingly, the dispersal of the PCM was 
effectively rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type CPAP or a phospho-mimic 
CPAP-S467D mutant, but not a non-phosphorylated CPAP-S467A mutant. Finally, we 
found that CPAP-S467D has a low affinity for microtubule binding but a high 
affinity for PCM proteins. Together, our results support a model wherein CPAP is 
required for proper mitotic progression, and phosphorylation of CPAP by Aurora-A 
is essential for maintaining spindle pole integrity.
