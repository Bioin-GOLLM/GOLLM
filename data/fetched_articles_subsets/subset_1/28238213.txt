Renalase was discovered as a protein synthesized by the kidney and secreted in 
blood where it circulates at a concentration of approximately 3-5 μg/ml. Initial 
reports suggested that it functioned as an NAD(P)H oxidase and could oxidize 
catecholamines. Administration of renalase lowers blood pressure and heart rate 
and also protects cells and organs against ischaemic and toxic injury. Although 
renalase's protective effect was initially ascribed to its oxidase properties, a 
paradigm shift in our understanding of the cellular actions of renalase is 
underway. We now understand that, independent of its enzymatic properties, 
renalase functions as a cytokine that provides protection to cells, tissues and 
organs by interacting with its receptor to activate protein kinase B, JAK/STAT, 
and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In addition, recent studies 
suggest that dysregulated renalase signalling may promote survival of several 
tumour cells due to its capacity to augment expression of growth-related genes. 
In this review, we focus on the cytoprotective actions of renalase and its 
capacity to sustain cancer cell growth and also the translational opportunities 
these findings represent for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for 
organ injury and cancer.
