STUDY OBJECTIVES: Previously, we found a significant association between the 
dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphism Taq IA and sudden onset of sleep in 
patients with Parkinson disease. Here we evaluated the association between the 
preprohypocretin (-909T/C), (-22C/T), and (-20C/A) polymorphisms and sudden 
onset of sleep in the same population of patients with Parkinson disease.
DESIGN: We conducted an association study analyzing the distribution of 
preprohypocretin polymorphisms in Germanic, caucasian Parkinson disease patients 
with and without sudden onset of sleep, matched according to drug therapy, 
disease duration, sex, and age.
SETTING: Movement disorders section at a university hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: 132 Parkinson disease patients with sudden onset of sleep and 132 
Parkinson disease patients without sudden onset of sleep.
INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples were taken from each participant and used for DNA 
extraction. Polymorphisms were analyzed by established polymerase chain reaction 
protocols or direct sequencing.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The variant allele T of the (-909T/C) preprohypocretin 
polymorphism was more commonly found in Parkinson disease patients with sudden 
onset of sleep. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant 
differences in the genotype (P = .024) and allele (P = .018) distribution 
between both groups. For heterozygous and homozygous carriers of allele T, the 
genotype relative-risk estimates for the presence of sudden onset of sleep were 
2.01 (95% confidence interval: 0.76-5.34) and 2.81 (95% confidence interval: 
1.09-7.25), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a significant association between the (-909T/C) 
preprohypocretin polymorphism and sudden onset of sleep in Parkinson disease. 
However, we could not demonstrate any interaction between the Taq IA and 
(-909T/C) polymorphisms with respect to the occurrence of sudden onset of sleep, 
suggesting that multiple genetic factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
this phenomenon.
