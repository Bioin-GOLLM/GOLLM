Nearly 50% of HIV-infected individuals suffer from some form of HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HIV-1 Tat (a key HIV transactivator of 
transcription) protein is one of the first HIV proteins to be expressed after 
infection occurs and is absolutely required for the initiation of the HIV genome 
transcription. In addition to its canonical functions, various studies have 
shown the deleterious role of HIV-1 Tat in the development and progression of 
HAND. Within the CNS, only specific cell types can support productive viral 
replication (astrocytes and microglia), however Tat protein can be released form 
infected cells to affects HIV non-permissive cells such as neurons. Therefore, 
in this review, we will summarize the functions of HIV-1 Tat proteins in neural 
cells and its ability to promote HAND.
