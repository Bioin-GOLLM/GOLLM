Dantrolene (DAN) directly binds to cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) through 
Leu601-Cys620 in the N-terminal domain and subsequently inhibits diastolic Ca2+ 
leakage through RyR2. We previously reported that therapy using RyR2 V3599K 
mutation, which inhibits diastolic Ca2+ leakage by enhancing calmodulin (CaM) 
binding ability to RyR2, prevents left ventricular (LV) remodeling in transverse 
aortic constriction (TAC) heart failure. Here, we examined whether chronic 
administration of DAN prevents LV remodeling in TAC heart failure via the same 
mechanism as genetic therapy. A pressure-overloaded hypertrophy mouse model was 
developed using TAC. Wild-type (WT) mice were divided into three groups: 
sham-operated mice (Sham group), TAC mice (TAC group), and TAC mice treated with 
DAN (TAC-DAN group, 20 mg/kg/day, i.p.). They were then followed up for 8 weeks. 
The survival rate was higher in the TAC-DAN group (83%) than in the TAC group 
(49%), and serial echocardiography studies and pathological tissue analysis 
showed that LV remodeling was significantly prevented in the TAC-DAN group 
compared to the TAC group. An increase in the diastolic Ca2+ spark frequency and 
a decrease in the binding affinity of CaM to RyR2 were observed at 8 weeks in 
the TAC group but not in the TAC-DAN group. Stabilization of RyR2 with DAN 
prevented LV remodeling and improved survival after TAC by enhancing CaM binding 
to RyR2 and inhibiting RyR2-mediated diastolic Ca2+ leakage.
