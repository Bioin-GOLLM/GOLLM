Understanding individual responses to nutrition and medicine is of growing 
interest and importance. There is evidence that differences in bitter taste 
receptor (TAS2R) genes which give rise to two frequent haplotypes, TAS2R38-PAV 
(functional) and TAS2R38-AVI (non-functional), may impact inter-individual 
differences in health status. We here analyzed the relevance of the TAS2R38 
receptor in the regulation of the human immune response using the TAS2R38 
agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) from Brassica plants. A differential 
response in calcium mobilization upon AITC treatment in leucocytes from healthy 
humans confirmed a relevance of TAS2R38 functionality, independent from cation 
channel TRPV1 or TRPA1 activation. We further identified a TAS2R38-dependence of 
MAPK and AKT signaling activity, bactericidal (toxicity against E. coli) and 
anti-inflammatory activity (TNF-alpha inhibition upon cell stimulation). These 
in vitro results were derived at relevant human plasma levels in the low micro 
molar range as shown here in a human intervention trial with AITC-containing 
food.
