PURPOSE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a serious public health hazard due to 
its high morbidity, disability, and mortality. Currently, the exact molecular 
mechanisms of ICH are unknown. We tried to identify the ICH-related candidate 
blood messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers by microarray analysis and weighted gene 
co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected the blood samples from patients with ICH (n 
= 4) and from vascular risk factor (VRF) controls (n = 4) and analyzed the mRNA 
expression profiles by competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) microarray. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and then a weighted gene 
co-expression network was constructed. Modules with clinical significance were 
distinguished. Then, we downloaded two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets 
(GSE24265 and GSE125512). Candidate mRNAs were identified by taking the 
intersection of the DEGs in our microarray, the interesting genes in the key 
module, and the DEGs in GSE24265. Functional analysis involving Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and construction of a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 340 DEGs in our microarray were identified between the ICH 
group and the control group. Among the eight gene modules established by WGCNA, 
the yellow module containing 191 genes was the most strongly associated with 
ICH. Four candidate mRNAs (C3AR1, PAWR, ARNTL2, and LDLRAD4) were identified. In 
the early stage of ICH (within 24 h), C3AR1, PAWR, and ARNTL2 were highly 
expressed in the perihematomal tissue, but with low expressions in peripheral 
blood; in the late stage (72 h after the first blood draw), an obvious upward 
trend of C3AR1 and PAWR in peripheral blood was seen. Functional analysis showed 
that candidate mRNAs were concerned with multiple pathways, such as the Wnt 
signaling pathway and calcium signaling pathway. They might affect the process 
of ICH through neuroinflammation, cell apoptosis, and pyroptosis.
CONCLUSION: We identified four candidate blood mRNAs (C3AR1, PAWR, ARNTL2, and 
LDLRAD4) related to ICH. They showed different expression patterns in peripheral 
blood and perihematomal tissues and changed with time. They might play important 
roles in ICH through neuroinflammation, cell apoptosis, and pyroptosis and might 
shed new light to novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets in ICH.
