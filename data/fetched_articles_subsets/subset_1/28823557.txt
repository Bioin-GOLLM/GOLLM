The lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) is a frequent and consequential 
site of pediatric and adult glioma spread, but the cellular and 
molecular mechanisms mediating this are poorly understood. We demonstrate that 
neural precursor cell (NPC):glioma cell communication underpins this propensity 
of glioma to colonize the SVZ through secretion of chemoattractant signals 
toward which glioma cells home. Biochemical, proteomic, and functional analyses 
of SVZ NPC-secreted factors revealed the neurite outgrowth-promoting factor 
pleiotrophin, along with required binding partners SPARC/SPARCL1 and HSP90B, as 
key mediators of this chemoattractant effect. Pleiotrophin expression is 
strongly enriched in the SVZ, and pleiotrophin knock down starkly reduced glioma 
invasion of the SVZ in the murine brain. Pleiotrophin, in complex with the 
binding partners, activated glioma Rho/ROCK signaling, and ROCK inhibition 
decreased invasion toward SVZ NPC-secreted factors. These findings demonstrate a 
pathogenic role for NPC:glioma interactions and potential therapeutic targets to 
limit glioma invasion. PAPERCLIP.
