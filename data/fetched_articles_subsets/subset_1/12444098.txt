Telomerase-negative immortalized human cells maintain telomeres by alternative 
lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway(s), which may involve homologous 
recombination. We find that endogenous BLM protein co-localizes with telomeric 
foci in ALT human cells but not telomerase positive immortal cell lines or 
primary cells. BLM interacts in vivo with the telomeric protein TRF2 in ALT 
cells, as detected by FRET and co-immunoprecipitation. Transient over-expression 
of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-BLM results in marked, ALT cell-specific 
increases in telomeric DNA. The association of BLM with telomeres and its effect 
on telomere DNA synthesis require a functional helicase domain. Our results 
identify BLM as the first protein found to affect telomeric DNA synthesis 
exclusively in human ALT cells and suggest that BLM facilitates 
recombination-driven amplification of telomeres in ALT cells.
