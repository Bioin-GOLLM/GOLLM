OBJECT: This study aims to analyze the differentially expressed circRNA in colon 
adenocarcinoma (COAD) and evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic value. Analyze 
associated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in COAD.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify 
differentially expressed circRNA in COAD tissues and cells; Receiver operator 
characteristic (ROC) and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluating its 
diagnostic and prognostic value; Meanwhile we conducted CCK-8, invasion, and 
migration experiments in cell lines to explore the function of circRNA. In 
addition, a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was established using 
bioinformatics methods to explore its prognostic value and potential functional 
mechanisms.
RESULTS: Our study found that hsa_circ_0084927 is highly expressed in COAD 
tissues and cell lines. Plasma hsa_circ_0084927 can be used as a diagnostic 
marker for COAD patients; hsa_circ_0084927 can promote the proliferation, 
migration and invasion of COAD cells. In addition, we effectively constructed a 
ceRNA: network has_circ_0084927/miR-106b-5p/VEGFA. The ceRNA network indicates 
that hsa_circ_0084927 may affect the prognosis of COAD through the regulation of 
cell cycle, apoptosis and other pathways.
CONCLUSION: Our research results indicate that hsa_circ_0084927 has a 
cancer-promoting effect and may be used as a circulating tumor marker for COAD 
prognosis. In addition, this study proposes a new ceRNA network to provide new 
insights for the targeted therapy of COAD.
