Amyloid β (Aβ) and tau protein are both implicated in memory impairment, mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and early Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether and 
how they interact is unknown. Consequently, we asked whether tau protein is 
required for the robust phenomenon of Aβ-induced impairment of hippocampal 
long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely accepted cellular model of memory. We 
used wild-type mice and mice with a genetic knock-out of tau protein and 
recorded field potentials in an acute slice preparation. We demonstrate that the 
absence of tau protein prevents Aβ-induced impairment of LTP. Moreover, we show 
that Aβ increases tau phosphorylation and that a specific inhibitor of the tau 
kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 blocks the increased tau phosphorylation 
induced by Aβ and prevents Aβ-induced impairment of LTP in wild-type mice. 
Together, these findings show that tau protein is required for Aβ to impair 
synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and suggest that the Aβ-induced 
impairment of LTP is mediated by tau phosphorylation. We conclude that 
preventing the interaction between Aβ and tau could be a promising strategy for 
treating cognitive impairment in MCI and early AD.
