In order to identify the molecular pathways governing melanoma and track its 
progression, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach and targeted 
sequencing of cancer genes were employed. The primary tumor, as well as 
metastatic tissue, of an 84-year-old patient diagnosed with vulvar melanoma 
(VM), were investigated. The primary tumor specimen showed multiple somatic 
mutations in TP53 gene, suggesting its major contribution to melanoma origin. 
The metastatic sample showed additional alterations, including other 
melanoma-related genes. Clinical relevancy is postulated to juxtamembrane region 
instability of KIT gene (c-KIT). We did not identify BRAF or NRAS alterations, 
which are typical for the most common melanoma pathway-MAPK cascade. However, it 
should be noted that this is the first report evidencing PDGFRA in melanoma, 
although its role in triggering VM needs to be further elucidated.
