Sporadic angiosarcomas are aggressive vascular sarcomas whose rarity and genomic 
complexity present significant obstacles in deciphering the pathogenic 
significance of individual genetic alterations. Numerous fusion genes have been 
identified across multiple types of cancers, but their existence and 
significance remain unclear in sporadic angiosarcomas. In this study, we 
leveraged RNA-sequencing data from 13 human angiosarcomas and 76 spontaneous 
canine hemangiosarcomas to identify fusion genes associated with spontaneous 
vascular malignancies. Ten novel protein-coding fusion genes, including 
TEX2-PECAM1 and ATP8A2-FLT1, were identified in seven of the 13 human tumors, 
with two tumors showing mutations of TP53. HRAS and NRAS mutations were found in 
angiosarcomas without fusions or TP53 mutations. We found 15 novel 
protein-coding fusion genes including MYO16-PTK2, GABRA3-FLT1, and AKT3-XPNPEP1 
in 11 of the 76 canine hemangiosarcomas; these fusion genes were seen 
exclusively in tumors of the angiogenic molecular subtype that contained 
recurrent mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and NRAS. In particular, fusion 
genes and mutations of TP53 cooccurred in tumors with higher frequency than 
expected by random chance, and they enriched gene signatures predicting 
activation of angiogenic pathways. Comparative transcriptomic analysis of human 
angiosarcomas and canine hemangiosarcomas identified shared molecular signatures 
associated with activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. Our data suggest that 
genome instability induced by TP53 mutations might create a predisposition for 
fusion events that may contribute to tumor progression by promoting selection 
and/or enhancing fitness through activation of convergent angiogenic pathways in 
this vascular malignancy. IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that, while drive 
events of malignant vasoformative tumors of humans and dogs include diverse 
mutations and stochastic rearrangements that create novel fusion genes, 
convergent transcriptional programs govern the highly conserved morphologic 
organization and biological behavior of these tumors in both species.
