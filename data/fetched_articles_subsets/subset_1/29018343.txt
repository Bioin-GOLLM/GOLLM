Background: Not all patients with acid-related disorders receiving proton pump 
inhibitor (PP) treatment get adequate gastric pH control. The genetic variation 
of receptors, metabolic enzymes, and transporters are known to cause failures of 
therapies. We have conducted a study to evaluate the influence of gastric 
H+/K+-ATPase, CYP2C19, and ABCB1 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic profiles of dexlansoprazole injection in healthy Chinese 
subjects. Methods: A total of 51 subjects were enrolled for pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic study after a single intravenous administration of 20 or 30 mg 
dexlansoprazole. Plasma concentrations were determined using a chiral liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry method. The intragastric pH and 
baseline-adjusted intragastric pH parameters were introduced to evaluate the 
pharmacodynamic characters. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain 
reaction. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly influenced 
by CYP2C19 phenotypes, and gastric acid secretion inhibition were affected by 
both gastric H+/K+-ATPase and CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Gastric H+/K+-ATPase 
genotypes had greater effects than CYP2C19 genotypes on the suppression of 
gastric acid secretion. Conclusion: Gastric H+/K+-ATPase polymorphism may be one 
of the main reasons that cause insufficient gastric acid inhibition.
