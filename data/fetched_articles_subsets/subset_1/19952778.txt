BACKGROUND: Considering that the role of nitric oxide as a vasodilator is 
increased after an acute bout of exercise and that the 894G>T polymorphism of 
the endothelial nitric oxide synthase seems to reduce the nitric oxide release 
in response to shear stress, the present study investigated the 894G>T 
polymorphism in relation to vascular reactivity following maximal dynamic 
exercise.
METHOD: We studied 110 healthy volunteers (wild-type group 45.5% and polymorphic 
group 54.5%). The protocol included vascular reactivity assessment at baseline 
and during reactive hyperemia, before, 10, 60 and 120 min after a maximal 
cardiopulmonary exercise test. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples to 
determine the 894G>T polymorphism.
RESULTS: There were no differences between the wild-type and polymorphic groups 
concerning anthropometric, metabolic and hemodynamic characteristics. Blood 
flow, before maximal exercise, was similar between the wild-type and the 
polymorphic groups. The polymorphic group presented lower vascular reactivity 
regardless of time (P = 0.019 for group main effect), and posthoc analysis 
revealed that polymorphic patients had lower values than wild-type only at the 
120 min measurement (P = 0.002). Concerning within-group analysis, vascular 
reactivity increased at 10 min after exercise (P = 0.029) returning to baseline 
at 120 min (P = 0.005) in the polymorphic group.
CONCLUSION: Patients with the 894G>T polymorphism had lower vascular reactivity 
after a single bout of exercise.
