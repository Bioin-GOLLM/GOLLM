Gastric cancers have been historically classified based on histomorphologic 
features. The Cancer Genome Atlas network reported the comprehensive 
identification of genetic alterations associated with gastric cancer, 
identifying four distinct subtypes- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive, 
microsatellite-unstable/instability (MSI), genomically stable and chromosomal 
instability. In particular, EBV-positive and MSI gastric cancers seem responsive 
to novel immunotherapies drugs. The aim of this review is to describe MSI and 
EBV positive gastric cancer's subgroups and their relationship with novel 
immunotherapy.
