Alström syndrome (ALMS) is a rare genetic disorder that has been included in the 
ciliopathies group, in the last few years. Ciliopathies are a growing group of 
diseases associated with defects in ciliary structure and function. The 
development of more powerful genetic approaches has been replaced the strategies 
to follow for getting a successful molecular diagnosis for these patients, 
especially for those without the typical ALMS phenotype. In an effort to deepen 
the understanding of the pathogenesis of ALMS disease, much work has been done, 
in order to establish the biological implication of ALMS1 protein, which is 
still being elucidated. In addition to its role in ciliary function and 
structure maintenance, this protein has been implicated in intracellular 
trafficking, regulation of cilia signaling pathways, and cellular 
differentiation, among others. All these progresses will lead to identifying 
therapeutic targets, thus opening the way to future personalized therapies for 
human ciliopathies.
