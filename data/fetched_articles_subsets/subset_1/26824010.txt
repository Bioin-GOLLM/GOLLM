BRAF V600E is the most common somatic mutation seen in patients with metastatic 
melanoma. BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), along with MEK inhibitors (MEKi), have been 
shown to improve overall survival in these patients with a median time to 
resistance of 6-10 months. We describe a patient with an ongoing response of 48 
months on intermittent BRAFi therapy. She was started on vemurafenib at initial 
diagnosis, which was discontinued after a total of 39 weeks of therapy, and 
achieved a complete response due to cumulative toxicity. Upon evidence of 
progression on serial imaging following 81 weeks of disease-free status, BRAFi 
was resumed with dabrafenib, along with trametinib. Complete response was seen 
with seven weeks of treatment. Therapy was discontinued again, due to side 
effects, with an intention to pursue intermittent therapy. Serial imaging, so 
far, has shown no progression or recurrence of disease after over a year (66 
weeks and ongoing) since discontinuation of therapy. This case underscores the 
clinical feasibility of intermittent BRAFi therapy in patients while still 
achieving a prolonged response. Disease control of 48 months, to date, has been 
achieved using therapy only "as needed" and keeping toxicities to the minimum.
