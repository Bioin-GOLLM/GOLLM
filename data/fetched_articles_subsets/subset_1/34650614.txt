OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of UCP1 protein in brown fat by 
establishing a model of gestational diabetes mellitus through intervention of 
high fat and carbohydrate diet. To explore the changes of UCP1 protein in brown 
fat in gestational diabetic mice, and analyze the characteristics of abnormal 
glucose metabolism in gestational diabetic mice and its relationship with 
changes in adipocyte morphology and insulin resistance.
METHODS: Eighty C57BL/6J pregnant mice were randomly divided into a normal 
control group and a high-fat and high-sugar feeding group. The normal control 
group was fed a normal diet, while the high-fat and high-sugar group was fed a 
high-fat and high-sugar diet to establish a gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) 
model. On the pregnancy days 0, 10, and 18, the weight and fasting glucose were 
measured. On the pregnancy day 18, the triglycerides (TG), the total cholesterol 
(TC), free fatty acid (FFA), insulin levels, and insulin resistance index 
(HOMA-IR) were measured or calculated. At the same time, brown fat UCP1 protein 
of the two groups of pregnant mice were measured using Western blot Observed the 
Adipose tissue pathological changes by staining HE. The adipocyte was observed, 
and the correlation was analyzed.
RESULTS: Twenty-one pregnant mice reach the level of gestational diabetes 
diagnosis (FBG ≥ 5.1 mmol/L) in the high-fat and high-sugar diet group. On the 
pregnancy day 10 and 18, the fasting plasma glucose and the body weight 
significantly increased (P < 0.05). The total cholesterol, triglycerides, free 
fatty acid, insulin level, and insulin resistance index of the GDM group were 
also higher compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). The adipocyte 
size significantly increased in the GDM mice. TG, TC, FFA, and body weight at 18 
days of gestation were significantly correlated with HOMA-IR and 
single-adipocyte area in the GDM mice. HOMA-IR was significantly correlated with 
a single-adipocyte area. Compared with the normal control group, the UCP1 
proteins of GDM mice decreased significantly and negatively correlated with body 
weight increase.
CONCLUSION: Feeding C57BL/6J pregnant mice with high fat and high sugar to 
establish a gestational diabetes mouse model has good stability and is similar 
to human gestational diabetes. The reduction of brown fat UCP1 protein in GDM 
mice has a certain correlation with obesity tendency and obvious insulin 
resistance.
