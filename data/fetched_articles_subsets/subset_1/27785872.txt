INTRODUCTION: We characterized five patients affected with von Willebrand 
disease (VWD) carrying the p.Arg1379Cys mutation. One was diagnosed as VWD type 
1 and four as type 2M. The 2M patients also have the variant p.Ala1377Val in cis 
with p.Arg1379Cys.
AIM: To evaluate the role of p.Ala1377Val and p.Arg1379Cys von Willebrand factor 
(VWF) variants to explain patients' phenotype.
METHODS: Conventional phenotype tests were used to evaluate patients' plasma and 
platelets. Direct sequence analysis of exon 28 was carried out. The allele 
frequency of p.Ala1377Val was evaluated using online database. pcDNA3.1-VWF-WT 
and mutant (A1377V, R1379C and A1377V-R1379C) expression vectors were 
transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. The capacity of WT and mutant 
recombinant (r)VWF (along with patients' plasma VWF) to bind glycoprotein Ibα 
(GpIbα) were evaluated, using two ELISA assays. One with a wild-type (WT) 
recombinant (r)GpIbα at increasing ristocetin concentrations (from 0 to 1.50 mg 
mL-1 ) and the other with a gain-of-function mutant rGpIbα (VWF:GPIbM).
RESULTS: The substitution c.4130C>T (p.Ala1377Val) was reported as rare variant 
in online databases. At 0.25 mg mL-1 of ristocetin, WT, A1377V and R1379C showed 
6, 7.5 and 12-fold increased binding to rGpIbα, respectively. A1377V-R1379C rVWF 
showed no increased binding to rGpIbα at the same ristocetin concentration and 
reached the highest binding, of only 3-fold increased, at 1.50 mg mL-1 of 
ristocetin. The VWF:GPIbM showed strongly reduced values for the A1377V-R1379C 
rVWF and the 2M patients' plasma.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the presence of both p.Ala1377Val and 
p.Arg1379Cys mutations (synergistic effect) abolishes the binding of rVWF to 
rGpIbα, explaining patients' 2M phenotype.
