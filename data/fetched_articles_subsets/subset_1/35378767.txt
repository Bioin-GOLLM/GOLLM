BACKGROUND: Cancer risks vary in different BRCA1/2 mutations. We are interested 
in identifying regions associated with elevated/reduced risks of breast/ovarian 
cancers in the Chinese population and comparing with previously reported 
Caucasian-based breast/ovarian cancer cluster regions (OCCR/BCCR). We also aim 
to characterize the distribution and estimate the cancer risks of different 
Chinese recurrent mutations.
METHODS: A total of 3,641 cancer-free women and 4,278 female cancer patients 
were included in the study. Germline BRCA1/2 status was detected with 
amplicon-based next-generation sequencing. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of 
breast cancer and OR of ovarian cancer, and their ratio of the two ORs (ROR) for 
each region. ROR >1 indicated elevated odds of breast cancer and/or decreasing 
odds of ovarian cancer, and vice versa. The frequency, distribution, and 
penetrance of six known Chinese founder mutations were characterized, 
respectively. Haplotype analysis and age estimation were performed on the most 
prevalent founder mutation BRCA1: c.5470_5477del.
RESULTS: A total of 729 subjects were detected with germline BRCA1/2 deleterious 
mutations. The putative Chinese OCCR/BCCR partially overlapped with 
Caucasian-based OCCR/BCCR and shared structural-functional characteristics. The 
six known Chinese founder mutations greatly vary in both distribution and 
penetrance. The two widely spread mutations are estimated to convey low 
penetrance, while the area-restricted founder mutations seemed to confer 
higher/complete penetrance. BRCA1: c.5470_5477del is estimated to have emerged 
∼2,090 years ago (70 B.C.) during the Han dynasty.
CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1/2 carriers with different genotypes have significantly 
different cancer risks. An optimal risk assessment should be mutation specific, 
rather than concerning a single figure.
