Dietary supplied double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can trigger RNA interference (RNAi) 
systemically in some animals, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. 
Although this phenomenon has been utilized as a major tool for gene silencing in 
C. elegans, how cells spread the silencing RNA throughout the organism is 
largely unknown. Here, we identify two novel systemic RNAi-related factors, 
REXD-1 and TBC-3, and show that these two factors together with SID-5 act 
redundantly to promote systemic spreading of dsRNA. Animals that are defective 
in all REXD-1, TBC-3, and SID-5 functions show strong deficiency in export of 
dsRNA from intestinal cells, whereas cellular uptake and processing of dsRNA and 
general secretion events other than dsRNA secretion are still functional in the 
triple mutant animals. Our findings reveal pathways that specifically regulate 
the export of dsRNA in parallel, implying the importance of spreading RNA 
molecules for intercellular communication in organisms.
