BACKGROUND: Japanese cedar pollinosis is the most common form of hayfever in 
Japan in spring and has remarkably increased since 1960.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to clarify the candidate genes for cedar pollinosis using a 
case-control study.
METHODS: After diagnosing 351 subjects on the basis of an intradermal test, 
nasal provocation test, and questionnaire regarding nasal and conjunctival 
symptoms, we determined the blood-specific IgE values and genotypes of 
eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and interleukin-4 receptor alpha-chain (IL4RA) in 
145 patients with pollinosis and 206 healthy subjects, including 75 healthy 
subjects with higher specific IgE values.
RESULTS: We found significant differences in the frequencies of Pro358Leu in EPO 
and of Ile50Val and Glu375Ala in IL4RA between patients and healthy subjects. 
There was a significantly higher frequency of 358Leu in EPO in patients than in 
healthy subjects showing a higher specific IgE value. In contrast, we recognized 
significant changes in the prevalence of Ile50Val and Glu375Ala in IL4RA in 
healthy subjects with a normal IgE value compared with those in healthy subjects 
with a higher specific IgE value. The relationship between EPO polymorphisms and 
the onset of symptoms was exactly opposite that for IL4RA.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Pro358Leu in EPO is strongly involved in 
the development of cedar pollinosis. Ile50Val and Glu375Ala in IL4RA seem to be 
related to cedar pollen sensitization. Subjects with Ile50 or Glu375 might 
develop cedar pollinosis with increased exposure to cedar pollen.
