Protein phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism of cellular signalling. 
The c-JUN proto-oncoprotein is phosphorylated at four residues within its 
transactivation domain (TAD) by the JNK family kinases, but the functional 
significance of c-JUN multisite phosphorylation has remained elusive. Here we 
show that c-JUN phosphorylation by JNK exhibits defined temporal kinetics, with 
serine63 and serine73 being phosphorylated more rapidly than threonine91 and 
threonine93. We identify the positioning of the phosphorylation sites relative 
to the kinase docking motif, and their primary sequence, as the main factors 
controlling phosphorylation kinetics. Functional analysis reveals three c-JUN 
phosphorylation states: unphosphorylated c-JUN recruits the MBD3 repressor, 
serine63/73 doubly-phosphorylated c-JUN binds to the TCF4 co-activator, whereas 
the fully phosphorylated form disfavours TCF4 binding attenuating JNK 
signalling. Thus, c-JUN phosphorylation encodes multiple functional states that 
drive a complex signalling response from a single JNK input.
