The amphibian family Leptodactylidae is divided into three sub-families: 
Leiuperinae, Leptodactylinae, and Paratelmatobiinae. Host-defense peptides 
(HDPs) present in the skins of frogs belonging to the Leptodactylinae have been 
studied extensively, but information is limited  regarding peptides from 
Leiuperinae species. Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin 
secretions from the Tungara frog Engystomops pustulosus (Leiuperinae) collected 
in Trinidad led to the isolation and structural characterization of previously 
undescribed pustulosin-1 (FWKADVKEIG KKLAAKLAEELAKKLGEQ), [Q28E] pustulosin-1 
(pustulosin-2), and pustulosin-3 (DWKETAKELLKKIGAKVAQVISDKLNPAPQ). The primary 
structures of these peptides do not resemble those of previously described frog 
skin HDPs. In addition, the secretions contained tigerinin-1EP (GCKTYLIEPPVCT) 
with structural similarity to the tigerinins previously identified in skin 
secretions from frogs from the family Dicroglossidae. Pustulosin-1 and -3 
adopted extended α-helical conformations in 25% trifluoroethanol-water and in 
the presence of cell membrane models (sodium dodecylsulfate and 
dodecylphosphocholine micelles). Pustulosin-1 and -3 displayed cytotoxic 
activity against a range of human tumor-derived cell lines (A549, MDA-MB-231, 
and HT29), but their therapeutic potential for development into anti-cancer 
agents is limited by their comparable cytotoxic activity against non-neoplastic 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The peptides also displayed weak 
antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli (MIC = 125 µM) but were inactive 
against Staphylococcus aureus. Tigerinin-1EP was inactive against both the 
tumor-derived cells and bacteria.
