Examination of the nature of different bond activations along the same catalytic 
path is of general interest in chemistry and biology. In this report, we compare 
the physical nature of two sequential H-transfers in the same enzymatic 
reaction. Thymidylate synthase (TSase) catalyzes a complex reaction that 
involves many chemical transformations including two different C-H bond 
cleavages, a rate-limiting C-H-C hydride transfer and a non-rate-limiting C-H-O 
proton transfer. Although the large kinetic complexity imposes difficulties in 
studying the proton transfer catalyzed by TSase, we are able to experimentally 
extract the intrinsic kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on both steps. In contrast 
with the hydride transfer, the intrinsic KIEs of the proton transfer are 
temperature dependent. The results are interpreted within the framework of the 
Marcus-like model. This interpretation suggests that TSase optimizes the 
donor-acceptor geometries for the slower and overall rate-limiting hydride 
transfer but not for the faster proton transfer.
