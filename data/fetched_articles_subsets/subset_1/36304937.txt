To exploit the Rhinolophus sinicus-specific virome, 29 Rhinolophus sinicus were 
gathered in Lincang, China. Enriched viral sequences of 22 virus families were 
acquired by metavirome techniques. Hereby, the part of virome in Rhinolophus 
sinicus, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Getah virus, and Japanese 
encephalitis virus (JEV) were validated by PCR. Five CHIKV viral sequences were 
amplified, among which CHIKV-China/B2016C-1 shared the highest homology to CHIKV 
isolated from Italy in 2007, with the genotype as African ECS. Eight JEV viral 
sequences were amplified, of which JEV-China/B2016E-1 shared the highest 
homology with at least 91.3% nt identity with the JEV sequence found in South 
Korea in 1988 and was classified as genotype III. Notably, JEV was isolated for 
the first time in Rhinolophus sinicus. The newly isolated JEV-China/B2016-1 
could increase infectivity while passaging in Vero cells from BHK-21 cells. 
Overall, the research sheds insight into the diversity and viral susceptibility 
dynamics of the virome in Rhinolophus sinicus and reveals new light on the 
ecology of other important viral hosts.
