Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver 
disease. NAFLD often occurs associated with endocrinopathies. Evidence suggests 
that endocrine dysfunction may play an important role in NAFLD development, 
progression, and severity. Our work aimed to explore and summarize the crosstalk 
between the liver and different endocrine organs, their hormones, and 
dysfunctions. For instance, our results show that hyperprolactinemia, 
hypercortisolemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome seem to worsen NAFLD's pathway. 
Hypothyroidism and low growth hormone levels also may contribute to NAFLD's 
progression, and a bidirectional association between hypercortisolism and 
hypogonadism and the NAFLD pathway looks likely, given the current evidence. 
Therefore, we concluded that it appears likely that there is a link between 
several endocrine disorders and NAFLD other than the typically known type 2 
diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (MS). Nevertheless, there is 
controversial and insufficient evidence in this area of knowledge.
