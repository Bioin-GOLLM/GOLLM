Accelerating cancer research is expected to require new types of clinical 
trials. This report describes the Intensive Trial of OMics in Cancer (ITOMIC) 
and a participant with triple-negative breast cancer metastatic to bone, who had 
markedly elevated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that were monitored 48 times 
over 9 months. A total of 32 researchers from 14 institutions were engaged in 
the patient's evaluation; 20 researchers had no prior involvement in patient 
care and 18 were recruited specifically for this patient. Whole-exome sequencing 
of 3 bone marrow samples demonstrated a novel ROS1 variant that was estimated to 
be present in most or all tumor cells. After an initial response to cisplatin, a 
hypothesis of crizotinib sensitivity was disproven. Leukapheresis followed by 
partial CTC enrichment allowed for the development of a differential 
high-throughput drug screen and demonstrated sensitivity to investigational 
BH3-mimetic inhibitors of BCL-2 that could not be tested in the patient because 
requests to the pharmaceutical sponsors were denied. The number and size of CTC 
clusters correlated with clinical status and eventually death. Focusing the 
expertise of a distributed network of investigators on an intensively monitored 
patient with cancer can generate high-resolution views of the natural history of 
cancer and suggest new opportunities for therapy. Optimization requires access 
to investigational drugs.
