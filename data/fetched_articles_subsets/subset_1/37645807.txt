BACKGROUND: The CDC and ACIP recommend COVID-19 vaccination for patients with 
inborn errors of immunity (IEI). Not much is known about vaccine safety in IEI 
and whether vaccination attenuates infection severity in IEI.
OBJECTIVE: To estimate COVID-19 vaccination safety and examine effect on 
outcomes in patients with IEI.
METHODS: We built a secure registry database in conjunction with the United 
States Immunodeficiency Network to examine vaccination frequency and indicators 
of safety and effectiveness in IEI patients. The registry opened on January 1, 
2022 and closed on August 19, 2022.
RESULTS: Physicians entered data on 1,245 patients from 24 countries. The most 
common diagnoses were antibody deficiencies (63.7%). At least 1 COVID-19 vaccine 
was administered to 806 patients (64.7%), and 216 patients received vaccination 
prior to the development of COVID-19. The most common vaccines administered were 
mRNA-based (84.0%). Seventeen patients were reported to seek outpatient clinic 
or emergency room care for a vaccine-related complication and one patient was 
hospitalized for symptomatic anemia. Eight hundred twenty-three patients (66.1%) 
experienced COVID-19 infection. Of these, 156 patients required hospitalization 
(19.0%), 47 required ICU care (5.7%), and 28 died (3.4%). Rates of 
hospitalization (9.3% versus 24.4%, p<0.001), ICU admission (2.8% versus 7.6%, 
p=0.013), and death (2.3% versus 4.3%, p=0.202) in patients who had COVID-19 
were lower in patients who received vaccination prior to infection. In adjusted 
logistic regression analysis, not having at least one COVID-19 vaccine 
significantly increased the odds of hospitalization and ICU admission.
CONCLUSION: Vaccination for COVID-19 in the IEI population appears safe and 
attenuates COVID-19 severity.
