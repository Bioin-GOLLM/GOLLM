Hybrid layers of donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymers containing 
N,N'-dialkylperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxydiimide electron-acceptor units 
covered with silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were prepared by electrochemical 
doping of pristine layers during reduction processes. In situ optical absorption 
spectra of the layers were recorded during the formation of Ag-NP coverage. The 
hybrid layers were characterized by absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and energy dispersive 
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In the absorption spectra of the hybrid layers, a 
surface plasmon band characteristic of Ag-NPs appeared. Significant improvements 
in light absorption due to the plasmonic effects of Ag NPs were observed. Stable 
Ag-NPs with an average diameter of 41-63 nm were formed on the surface, as 
proven by SEM and XPS. The Ag-NP coverage and size depended on the hybrid layer 
preparation conditions and on the copolymer composition. The metallic character 
of the Ag-NPs was proven by XPS. The location in the surface layer was further 
confirmed by EDX analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
report on such hybrid layers having the potential for a variety of photonic and 
electronic applications.
