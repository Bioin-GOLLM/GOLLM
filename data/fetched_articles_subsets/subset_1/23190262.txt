Human RBM25 (RNA-binding motif protein 25) is a novel splicing factor that 
contains a PWI domain, a newly identified RNA/DNA-binding domain, and regulates 
Bcl-x pre-mRNA alternative splicing. The flanking basic region has been 
suggested to serve as a co-operative partner of the PWI domain in the binding of 
nucleic acids, but the structure of this basic region is unknown. In the present 
paper, we report the crystal structure of the RBM25 PWI domain and its flanking 
basic region. The PWI domain is revealed to comprise a conserved four-helix 
bundle, and the flanking basic region forms two Î±-helices and associates with 
helix H4 of the PWI domain. These interactions promote directly the formation of 
an enlarged nucleic-acid-binding platform. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals 
a positively charged nucleic-acid-binding surface in the RBM25 PWI domain that 
is entirely different from that in the SRm160 PWI domain. Furthermore, we show 
that the promotion of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS isoform expression by RBM25 is 
facilitated by the PWI domain in vivo. Thus the present study suggests that the 
PWI domain plays an important role in the regulation of Bcl-x pre-mRNA 
alternative splicing.
