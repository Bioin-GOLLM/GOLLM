Limited efforts have been made in assessing the effect of genome-wide profiling 
of RNA splicing-related variation on lung cancer risk. In the present study, we 
first identified RNA splicing-related genetic variants linked to lung cancer in 
a genome-wide profiling analysis and then conducted a two-stage (discovery and 
replication) association study in populations of European ancestry. Discovery 
and validation were conducted sequentially with a total of 29,266 cases and 
56,450 controls from both the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung 
and the International Lung Cancer Consortium as well as the OncoArray database. 
For those variants identified as significant in the two datasets, we further 
performed stratified analyses by smoking status and histological type and 
investigated their effects on gene expression and potential regulatory 
mechanisms. We identified three genetic variants significantly associated with 
lung cancer risk: rs329118 in JADE2 (P = 8.80E-09), rs2285521 in GGA2 
(P = 4.43E-08), and rs198459 in MYRF (P = 1.60E-06). The combined effects of all 
three SNPs were more evident in lung squamous cell carcinomas (P = 1.81E-08, 
P = 6.21E-08, and P = 7.93E-04, respectively) than in lung adenocarcinomas and 
in ever smokers (P = 9.80E-05, P = 2.70E-04, and P = 2.90E-05, respectively) 
than in never smokers. Gene expression quantitative trait analysis suggested a 
role for the SNPs in regulating transcriptional expression of the corresponding 
target genes. In conclusion, we report that three RNA splicing-related genetic 
variants contribute to lung cancer susceptibility in European populations. 
However, additional validation is needed, and specific splicing mechanisms of 
the target genes underlying the observed associations also warrants further 
exploration.
