Although successes in cancer immunotherapy have generated considerable 
excitement, this form of treatment has been largely ineffective in patients with 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Mechanisms that contribute to the poor 
antitumor immune response in PDA are not well understood. Here, we demonstrated 
that cytokine IL35 is a major immunosuppressive driver in PDA and potentiates 
tumor growth via the suppression of endogenous antitumor T-cell responses. The 
growth of pancreatic tumors in mice deficient for IL35 was significantly 
reduced. An analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells revealed a role for IL35 
in the expansion of regulatory T cells and the suppression of CD4+ effector T 
cells. We also detected a robust increase in both the infiltration and 
activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, suggesting that targeting IL35 may be an 
effective strategy to convert PDA from an immunologically "cold" to "hot" tumor. 
Although PDA is typically resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, we demonstrated 
robust synergistic reduction in tumor growth when IL35 deficiency was combined 
with anti-PD-1 treatment. These findings provide new insight into the function 
of IL35 in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer and underscore the potential 
significance of IL35 as a therapeutic target for use in combination 
immunotherapy approaches in this deadly malignancy. Cancer Immunol Res; 6(9);
