Classic late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a 
neurodegenerative disease in which autofluorescent "curvilinear" storage bodies 
accumulate in tissues from affected patients. Recently, the LINCL gene (CLN2) 
has been found to code for a pepstatin-insensitive lysosomal protease whose 
activity is deficient in LINCL specimens. We report the first 2 cases of 
successful prenatal testing for LINCL by using DNA and enzyme-based methods on 
amniocytes, and describe a new private mutation in one of the families analyzed. 
These approaches allow definitive prenatal diagnosis and represent a significant 
improvement over previous pathological methods.
