Aldo-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1) deficiency, a rare but life-threatening form of 
bile acid deficiency, has not been previously described in China. Here, we 
describe the first two primary ∆4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency patients 
in Mainland China diagnosed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy of 
urinary bile acids and confirmed by genetic analysis. A high proportion of 
atypical 3-oxo-∆4-bile acids in the urine indicated a deficiency in 
∆4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase. All of the coding exons and adjacent intronic 
sequence of the AKR1D1 gene were sequenced using peripheral lymphocyte genomic 
DNA of two patients and one of the patient's parents. One patient exhibited 
compound heterozygous mutations: c.396C>A and c.722A>T, while the other was 
heterozygous for the mutation c.797G>A. Based on these mutations, a diagnosis of 
primary ∆4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase deficiency could be confirmed. With 
ursodeoxycholic acid treatment and fat-soluble vitamin supplements, liver 
function tests normalized rapidly, and the degree of hepatomegaly was markedly 
reduced in both patients.
