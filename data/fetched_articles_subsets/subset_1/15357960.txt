A series of analogs of GLP-1(7-36) amide containing a 
Nepsilon-(2-[2-[2-(3-maleimidopropylamido)ethoxy]ethoxy]acetyl)lysine has been 
synthesized and the resulting derivatives were bioconjugated to Cys34 of human 
serum albumin (HSA). The GLP-1-HSA bioconjugates were analyzed in vitro to 
assess the stabilizing effect of bioconjugation in the presence of DPP-IV as 
well as GLP-1 receptor binding and activation. Compound 9 (CJC-1131) having the 
point of attachment to albumin at the C-terminal of GLP-1 and a D-alanine 
substitution at position 8 was identified as having the best combination of 
stability and bioactivity.
