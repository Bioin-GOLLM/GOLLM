BACKGROUND: Urological cancers occur worldwide. Many factors, among which the 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism, are said to be 
associated with the cancer risk. We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the 
association between urological cancer susceptibility and COMT Val158Met in 
different genetic models.
METHODS: This study was based on material obtained from the PubMed, HuGENet and 
Embase databases. Four models including dominant (AA + AG vs. GG), recessive (AA 
vs. AG + GG), codominant (AA vs. AG, AA vs. GG) and per-allele analysis (A vs. 
G) were applied. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were used to evaluate the power of the associations.
RESULTS: Fourteen eligible studies comprising 3,285 cases and 3,594 controls 
were included. Although we could not detect a positive function of the COMT 
Val158Met polymorphism in urological cancers, the polymorphism might be 
significantly associated with bladder cancer risk (dominant model [AA + AG vs. 
GG]: OR = 0.736, 95% CI = 0.586-0.925, I2 = 0.00%; recessive model [AA vs. AG + 
GG]: OR = 0.822, 95%CI = 0.653-1.035, I2 = 6.30%; codominant model [AA vs. AG]: 
OR = 0.908, 95% CI = 0.710-1.161, I2 = 0.00%; codominant model [AA vs. GG]: OR = 
0.693, 95% CI = 0.524-0.917, I2 = 30.20%; allele analysis [A vs. G]: OR = 0.826, 
95%CI = 0.717-0.951, I2 = 30.20%). The same significant associations were not 
found for kidney cancer and prostate cancer risk in different ethnicities. There 
also seemed to be no distinct effect of the polymorphism on benign prostatic 
hyperplasia.
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that bladder cancer but not prostate cancer and kidney 
cancer could be significantly associated with the Val158Met polymorphism. 
Interaction of COMT genetic and related environmental factors for urological 
cancers should not be ignored in future.
