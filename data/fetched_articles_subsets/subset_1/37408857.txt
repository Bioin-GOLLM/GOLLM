Ferroptosis is a distinct type of regulated cell death characterized by iron 
overload and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis is regulated by numerous factors 
and controlled by several mechanisms. This cell death type has a relationship 
with the immune system, which may be regulated by damage-associated molecular 
patterns. Ferroptosis participates in the progression of autoimmune diseases, 
including autoimmune hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's 
Disease, psoriasis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The present review 
summarizes the role of ferroptosis in autoimmune disorders and discusses 
ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune disease.
