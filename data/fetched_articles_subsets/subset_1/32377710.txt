Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare inherited disorder, which is caused 
by the partial deficiency of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), an enzyme of 
the heme biosynthetic pathway. Abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric disturbance and 
neuropathy are the typical manifestations of the disease. Complications such as 
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a rare type of brain lesion 
present on MRI, are also observed in patients with AIP. The present study 
reports on the case of a 36‑year‑old Chinese female patient with AIP and PRES. 
Genomic DNA were obtained from peripheral blood leukocytes and genomic regions 
of the HMBS gene were amplified as 2 fragments, which together contained all the 
exons and flanking intronic regions. Sanger sequencing of the amplified DNA 
fragments from the patient and the patient's family revealed a novel frameshift 
deletion (c.405‑406delAA) in exon 8 of the HMBS gene. This mutation leads to a 
subsequent truncated protein (p.Glu135AspfsX74). The recombinant mutant protein 
had 62% activity relative to the wild‑type protein but similar thermostability. 
It was confirmed that this novel mutation was the cause of AIP. Accumulation of 
D‑aminolevulinic acid (ALA) due to HMBS dysfunction is a potential mechanism of 
PRES. The manifestation of PRES may be associated with ALA‑induced cytotoxicity 
and the destruction of the blood‑brain barrier. In summary, in the present 
study, a novel pathogenic HMBS mutation was identified, expanding on the 
molecular heterogeneity of AIP.
