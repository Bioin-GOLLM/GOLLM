BACKGROUND: Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis are common in 
chronic liver diseases. However, the causal effect of alcoholic liver disease 
(ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on BMD remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study uses a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design to 
evaluate the genetically predicted effect of ALD and NAFLD on BMDs using summary 
data from publically available genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
METHODS: The GWAS summary statistics of ALD (1416 cases and 213,592 controls) 
and NAFLD (894 cases and 217,898 controls) were obtained from the FinnGen 
consortium. BMDs of four sites (total body, n = 56,284; femoral neck, n = 
32,735; lumbar spine, n = 28,498; forearm, n = 8143) were from the GEnetic 
Factors for OSteoporosis Consortium. Data for alcohol consumption (n = 112,117) 
and smoking (n = 33,299) and serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) level (n = 
417,580) were from UK-biobank. We first performed univariate MR analysis with 
the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method as the primary analysis to 
investigate the genetically predicted effect of ALD or NAFLD on BMD. Then, 
multivariate MR and mediation analysis were performed to identify whether the 
effect was mediated by alcohol consumption, smoking, or serum 25-OHD level.
RESULTS: The MR results suggested a robust genetically predicted effect of ALD 
on reduced BMD in the femoral neck (FN-BMD) (IVW beta = -0.0288; 95% CI: 
-0.0488, -0.00871; P = 0.00494) but not the other three sites. Serum 25-OHD 
level exhibited a significant mediating effect on the association between ALD 
and reduced FN-BMD albeit the proportion of mediation was mild (2.21%). No 
significant effects of NAFLD, alcohol consumption, or smoking on BMD in four 
sites, or reverse effect of BMD on ALD or NAFLD were detected.
CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the genetically predicted effect of ALD on 
reduced FN-BMD, and highlight the importance of periodic BMD and serum 25-OHD 
monitoring and vitamin D supplementation as needed in patients with ALD. Future 
research is required to validate our results and investigate the probable 
underlying mechanisms.
