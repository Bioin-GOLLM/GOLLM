BACKGROUND: As immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are increasingly being used 
due to effectiveness in various tumor entities, rare side effects occur more 
frequently. Pericardial effusion has been reported in patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after or under treatment with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors. However, knowledge about serositis and edemas induced by 
checkpoint inhibitors in other tumor entities is scarce.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Four cases with sudden onset of checkpoint inhibitor 
induced serositis (irSerositis) are presented including one patient with 
metastatic cervical cancer, two with metastatic melanoma and one with non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In all cases treatment with steroids was successful in 
the beginning, but did not lead to complete recovery of the patients. All 
patients required multiple punctures. Three of the patients presented with 
additional peripheral edema; in one patient only the lower extremities were 
affected, whereas the entire body, even face and eyelids were involved in the 
other patients. In all patients serositis was accompanied by other 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
CONCLUSION: ICI-induced serositis and effusions are complex to diagnose and 
treat and might be underdiagnosed. For differentiation from malignant serositis 
pathology of the punctured fluid can be helpful (lymphocytes vs. malignant 
cells). Identifying irSerositis as early as possible is essential since steroids 
can improve symptoms.
