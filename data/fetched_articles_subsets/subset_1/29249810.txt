The activity of certain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and of glutamate 
N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is altered in both schizophrenia and 
depression. Using postmortem prefrontal cortex samples from subjects with 
schizophrenia or depression, we observed a series of opposite changes in the 
expression of signaling proteins that have been implicated in the cross-talk 
between GPCRs and NMDARs. Thus, the levels of HINT1 proteins and NMDAR NR1 
subunits carrying the C1 cytosolic segment were increased in depressives and 
decreased in schizophrenics, respect to matched controls. The differences in NR1 
C1 subunits were compensated for via altered expression of NR1 subunits lacking 
the C1 segment; thus, the total number of NR1 subunits was comparable among the 
three groups. GPCRs influence the function of NR1 C1-containing NMDARs via 
PKC/Src, and thus, the association of mu-opioid and dopamine 2 receptors with 
NR1 C1 subunits was augmented in depressives and decreased in schizophrenics. 
However, the association of cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) with NR1 C1 remained 
nearly constant. Endocannabinoids, via CB1Rs, control the presence of NR1 C1 
subunits in the neural membrane. Thus, an altered endocannabinoid system may 
contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and depression by modifying 
the HINT1-NR1 C1/GPCR ratio, thereby altering GPCR-NMDAR cross-regulation.
