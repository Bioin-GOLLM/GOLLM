Short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) and Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) 
or Jeune Syndrome are recessively inherited skeletal ciliopathies characterized 
by profound skeletal abnormalities and are frequently associated with 
polydactyly and multiorgan system involvement. SRPS are produced by mutations in 
genes that participate in the formation and function of primary cilia and 
usually result from disruption of retrograde intraflagellar (IFT) transport of 
the cilium. Herein we describe a new spectrum of SRPS caused by mutations in the 
gene IFT81, a key component of the IFT-B complex essential for anterograde 
transport. In mutant chondrocytes, the mutations led to low levels of IFT81 and 
mutant cells produced elongated cilia, had altered hedgehog signaling, had 
increased post-translation modification of tubulin, and showed evidence of 
destabilization of additional anterograde transport complex components. These 
findings demonstrate the importance of IFT81 in the skeleton, its role in the 
anterograde transport complex, and expand the number of loci associated with 
SRPS.
