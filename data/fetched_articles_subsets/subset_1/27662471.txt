BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathies represent a rare group of disorders often of 
genetic origin. While approximately 50% of genetic causes are known for other 
types of cardiomyopathies, the genetic spectrum of restrictive cardiomyopathy 
(RCM) is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify the 
genetic background of idiopathic RCM and to compile the obtained genetic 
variants to the novel signalling pathways using in silico protein network 
analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used Illumina MiSeq setup to screen for 108 
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia-associated genes in 24 patients with idiopathic 
RCM. Pathogenicity of genetic variants was classified according to American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification.
RESULTS: Pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants were detected in 13 of 24 
patients resulting in an overall genotype-positive rate of 54%. Half of the 
genotype-positive patients carried a combination of pathogenic, 
likely-pathogenic variants and variants of unknown significance. The most 
frequent combination included mutations in sarcomeric and cytoskeletal genes 
(38%). A bioinformatics approach underlined the mechanotransducing protein 
networks important for RCM pathogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple gene mutations were detected in half of the RCM cases, 
with a combination of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal gene mutations being the most 
common. Mutations of genes encoding sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, and 
Z-line-associated proteins appear to have a predominant role in the development 
of RCM.
