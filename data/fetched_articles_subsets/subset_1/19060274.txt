PURPOSE: The severity of disease in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) can 
vary significantly, even among patients with the same primary mutations. It is 
hypothesized that modifier genes play important roles in determining the 
severity of RP, including the retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1) form of disease. To 
investigate the basis of variation in disease expression for RP1 disease, the 
authors generated congenic mice with a gene-targeted retinitis pigmentosa 1 
homolog (Rp1h) allele (Rp1h(tm1Eap)) on several different genetic backgrounds 
and analyzed their retinal phenotypes.
METHODS: The Rp1h(tm1Eap) allele was placed onto the C57BL/6J, DBA1/J, and A/J 
backgrounds. Retinal function of the resultant congenic mice was evaluated using 
electroretinographic analyses. Retinal structure and ultrastructure were 
evaluated using light and electron microscopy. Rp1h protein location was 
determined with immunofluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Analysis of the retinal phenotype of incipient congenic (N6) 
B6.129S-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap), DBA.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap), and 
A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice at 1 year of age showed retinal degeneration only 
in the A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice. Further analyses revealed that the 
photoreceptors of the fully congenic A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice show 
evidence of degeneration at 6 months of age and are almost completely lost by 18 
months of age. In contrast, the photoreceptor cells in the fully congenic 
B6.129S-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice remain healthy up to 18 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The severity of the retinal degeneration caused by the Rp1h(tm1Eap) 
allele is notably dependent on genetic background. The development and 
characterization of the B6.129S-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) and A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) 
congenic mouse lines will facilitate identification of sequence alterations in 
genes that modify the severity of RP1 disease.
