BACKGROUND: Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) differs etiologically and 
clinically from lung cancer attributed to smoking. After smoking, radon exposure 
is the second leading cause and the primary risk factor of lung cancer among 
never smokers. Exposure to radon can lead to genetic and epigenetic alterations 
in tumor genomes affecting genes and pathways involved in lung cancer 
development. The present study sought to explore genetic alterations associated 
with LCINS exposed to radon gas indoors.
METHODS: Genetic associations were assessed via a case-control study of LCINS 
(39 cases and 30 controls) using next generation sequencing. Associations 
between genetic mutations and high exposure to radon were investigated by 
OncoPrint and heatmap graphs. Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using various 
tools. According radon exposure levels, we divided subjects in two groups of 
cases and controls.
RESULTS: We found that ABL2 rs117218074, SMARCA4 rs2288845, PIK3R2 rs142933317, 
MAPK1 rs1803545, and androgen receptor (AR) rs66766400 were associated with 
LCINS exposed to high radon levels. Among these, Chromodomain helicase 
DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) rs74790047, TSC2 rs2121870, and AR rs66766408 were 
identified as common exonic mutations in both lung cancer patients and normal 
individuals exposed to high levels of radon indoor.
CONCLUSION: We identified that CHD4 rs74790047, TSC2 rs2121870, and AR 
rs66766408 are found to be common exonic mutations in both lung cancer patients 
and normal individuals exposed to radon indoors. Further analysis is needed to 
determine whether these genes are completely responsible for LCINS exposed to 
residential radon.
