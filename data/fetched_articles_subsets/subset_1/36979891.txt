BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with 
uncovered genetic etiology and pathogenesis. We aimed to screen out AF 
susceptibility genes with potential pathogenesis significance in the Chinese 
population.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the Limma 
package in three GEO data sets of atrial tissue. AF-related genes were 
identified by combination of DEGs and public GWAS susceptibility genes. 
Potential drug target genes were selected using the DrugBank, STITCH and TCMSP 
databases. Pathway enrichment analyses of AF-related genes were performed using 
the databases GO and KEGG databases. The pathway gene network was visualized by 
Cytoscape software to identify gene-gene interactions and hub genes. GWAS 
analysis of 110 cases of AF and 1201 controls was carried out through a 
genome-wide efficient mixed model in the Fangshan population to verify the 
results of bioinformatic analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 3173 DEGs were identified, 57 of which were found to be 
significantly associated with of AF in public GWAS results. A total of 75 
AF-related genes were found to be potential therapeutic targets. Pathway 
enrichment analysis selected 79 significant pathways and classified them into 7 
major pathway networks. A total of 35 hub genes were selected from the pathway 
networks. GWAS analysis identified 126 AF-associated loci. PDE3A and GSK3B were 
found to be overlapping genes between bioinformatic analysis and GWAS analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We screened out several pivotal genes and pathways involved in AF 
pathogenesis. Among them, PDE3A and GSK3B were significantly associated with the 
risk of AF in the Chinese population. Our study provided new insights into the 
mechanisms of action of AF.
