Mucus forms the first line of defence of the intestinal mucosa barrier, and 
mucin is its core component. Glutamine is a vital energy substance for goblet 
cells; it can promote mucus synthesis and alleviate damage to the intestinal 
mucus barrier after burn injury, but its mechanism is not fully understood. This 
study focused on the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of glutamine on 
the synthesis and modification of mucin 2 (MUC2) by using animal and cellular 
models of burn sepsis. We found that anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) plays a key role 
in the posttranslational modification of MUC2. Oxidative stress induced by burn 
sepsis enhanced the S-glutathionylation of AGR2, interfered with the processing 
and modification of MUC2 precursors by AGR2 and blocked the synthesis of mature 
MUC2. Further studies revealed that NADPH, catalysed by glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G6PD), is a key molecule in inhibiting oxidative stress and 
regulating AGR2 activity. Glutamine promotes O-linked N-acetylglucosamine 
(O-GlcNAc) modification of G6PD via the hexosamine pathway, which facilitates 
G6PD homodimer formation and increases NADPH synthesis, thereby inhibiting AGR2 
S-glutathionylation and promoting MUC2 maturation, ultimately reducing damage to 
the intestinal mucus barrier after burn sepsis. Overall, we have demonstrated 
that the central mechanisms of glutamine in promoting MUC2 maturation and 
maintaining the intestinal mucus barrier are the enhancement of G6PD 
glycosylation and inhibition of AGR2 S-glutathionylation.
