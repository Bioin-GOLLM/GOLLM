The biologic nature of morphologically bland-appearing thyroid inclusions in 
cervical lymph nodes continues to be a controversial topic. The diagnosis of 
benignity entails a much more conservative clinical approach than does 
malignancy. Arriving at the correct interpretation, however, can be difficult 
when only morphologic examination is performed. Incorporating the use of the 
recently identified BRAF V600E point mutation, a highly specific biomarker for 
papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, may provide a useful adjunct in assessing 
the biologic nature of morphologically bland-appearing thyroid inclusions in 
cervical lymph nodes. In this case report, bland thyroid inclusions were noted 
in addition to a primary papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and morphologically 
recognizable cervical lymph node metastasis. Cells from these separate entities 
were procured by lasercapture microdissection, and the DNA was isolated, 
amplified, and sequenced. Molecular analysis provided integral data indicating 
these morphologically bland thyroid inclusions were malignant, findings not 
readily apparent by morphologic examination alone.
