Background: We aimed to assess the clinical utility of a previously published 
score combining the total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV) on baseline FDG-PET/CT 
and pretreatment derived from the neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio (dNLR) for 
prognostication in NSCLC patients undergoing first-line immunotherapy (IT). 
Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, 63 advanced NSCLC patients 
with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50%, who underwent FDG-PET/CT before 
first-line IT, treated from January 2017 to September 2019, were enrolled. 
Associations between this score and the progression-free survival (PFS), overall 
survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and overall response rate (ORR) were 
evaluated. Results: The median (m) PFS and mOS were 7.7 (95% CI 4.9-10.6) and 
12.1 (8.6-15.6) months, respectively, and DCR and ORR were 65% and 58%, 
respectively. mOS was 17.9 months (14.6 not reached) for the good group versus 
13.8 (95%CI 8.4-18.9) and 6.6 (CI 2.0-11.2) months for the intermediate and poor 
groups, respectively. mPFS was 15.1 (95%CI 12.1-20.0) months for the good group 
versus 5.2 (1.9-8.5) and 1.9 (95%CI 1.3-2.5) months for the intermediate and 
poor groups, respectively. The poor prognosis group was associated with DCR and 
ORR (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The metabolic score combining TMTV on the baseline 
FDG-PET/CT scan and pretreatment dNLR was associated with the survival and 
response in a cohort of advanced NSCLC patients with ≥50% PD-L1 receiving 
frontline IT.
