Both genetics and physical activity (PA) contribute to bone mineral density 
(BMD), but it is unknown if the benefits of physical activity on childhood bone 
accretion depend on genetic risk. We, therefore, aimed to determine if PA 
influenced the effect of bone fragility genetic variants on BMD in childhood. 
Our sample comprised US children of European ancestry enrolled in the Bone 
Mineral Density in Childhood Study (N = 918, aged 5 to 19 years, and 52.4% 
female). We used a questionnaire to estimate hours per day spent in total, 
high-, and low-impact PA. We calculated a BMD genetic score (% BMD lowering 
alleles) using adult genome-wide association study (GWAS)-implicated BMD 
variants. We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to estimate femoral neck, 
total hip, and spine areal-BMD and total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral 
content (BMC) Z-scores. The BMD genetic score was negatively associated with 
each bone Z-score (eg, TBLH-BMC: estimate = -0.03, p = 1.3 × 10(-6) ). Total PA 
was positively associated with bone Z-scores; these associations were driven by 
time spent in high-impact PA (eg, TBLH-BMC: estimate = 0.05, p = 4.0 × 10(-10) ) 
and were observed even for children with lower than average bone Z-scores. We 
found no evidence of PA-adult genetic score interactions (p interaction > 0.05) 
at any skeletal site, and there was no evidence of PA-genetic score-Tanner stage 
interactions at any skeletal site (p interaction > 0.05). However, exploratory 
analyses at the individual variant level revealed that PA statistically 
interacted with rs2887571 (ERC1/WNT5B) to influence TBLH-BMC in males (p 
interaction = 7.1 × 10(-5) ), where PA was associated with higher TBLH-BMC 
Z-score among the BMD-lowering allele carriers (rs2887571 AA homozygotes: 
estimate = 0.08 [95% CI 0.06, 0.11], p = 2.7 × 10(-9) ). In conclusion, the 
beneficial effect of PA on bone, especially high-impact PA, applies to the 
average child and those genetically predisposed to lower adult BMD (based on 
GWAS-implicated BMD variants). Independent replication of our exploratory 
individual variant findings is warranted. © 2016 American Society for Bone and
