BACKGROUND: Gliomas are highly malignant with a poor prognosis. Studies have 
reported that DNA repair genes influence risk for glioma, but its relationship 
with prognosis is unclear. In this study, we want to explore the relationship 
between DNA repair genes (XRCC3, XRCC4 and XRCC5) and prognosis of astrocytoma 
in the Chinese Han population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 160 astrocytoma cases were recruited in our study. 
Survival probabilities were estimated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and 
significant differences were analyzed by using the log-rank test. Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to analyze the associations between 
genotypes with astrocytoma survival. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable models. All tests were 
two-sided and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.
RESULTS: The SNP (rs9288516) in XRCC5 (HR: 1.69, 95%CI: 1.04 - 2.77, p = 0.049), 
surgical approach (HR: 0.61, 95%CI: 0.43 - 0.88, p = 0.003) and chemotherapy 
(HR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.50 - 0.99, p = 0.029) were associated with astrocytoma 
prognosis. Further, the "A/A" genotype of rs9288516 in XRCC5 (HR: 1.67, 95%CI: 
1.02 - 2.72, p = 0.042) had significantly outcomes after adjusting for potential 
confounders, patients with poor tumor differentiation and the coexistence of the 
unfavorable genotypes.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms of XRCC5 play an important 
role in astrocytoma prognosis in the Chinese Han population which could be used 
in the determination of astrocytoma prognosis in clinical researches.
