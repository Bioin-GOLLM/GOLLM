PURPOSE: To locate and identify variants associated with macular corneal 
dystrophy (MCD) in Labrador Retriever (LR) dogs, in the candidate gene 
carbohydrate sulfotransferase-6 (CHST6).
METHODS: The single coding exon of canine CHST6 was sequenced in one affected LR 
with MCD and one control LR clinically clear of ocular disease. A further 71 
control LR with unknown clinical status were sequenced for the putative causal 
variant in CHST6. A TaqMan SNP genotyping assay was developed and used to screen 
an additional 84 dogs (five affected LR and 79 clinically clear LR). Finally, 
the variant was screened in a third cohort of 89 unrelated LR with unknown 
clinical status to estimate its allele frequency in the population of LR in the 
United Kingdom.
RESULTS: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified within the coding 
exon of CHST6, resulting in a missense mutation (c.814C>A, p.R272S). All six LR 
affected with MCD were homozygous for the mutant allele, while 140/151 control 
LR were homozygous for the wild-type allele and 11/151 were heterozygous for the 
mutation, indicating an association with MCD (P < 10-5 ). The mutant allele was 
present in the unrelated LR cohort at a frequency of 0.017, suggesting carrier 
and affection rates of 3.3% and 0.028%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A missense mutation in the CHST6 gene is strongly associated with 
autosomal recessive MCD in the LR.
