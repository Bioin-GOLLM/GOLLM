BACKGROUND: SCNT (somatic cell nuclear transfer) is of great significance to 
biological research and also to the livestock breeding. However, the survival 
rate of the SCNT cloned animals is relatively low compared to other transgenic 
methods. This indicates the potential epigenetic variations between them. DNA 
methylation is a key marker of mammalian epigenetics and its alterations will 
lead to phenotypic differences. In this study, 
ASMT (acetylserotonin-O-methyltransferase) ovarian overexpression transgenic 
goat was produced by using SCNT. To investigate whether there are epigenetic 
differences between cloned and WT (wild type) goats, WGBS (whole-genome 
bisulfite sequencing) was used to measure the whole-genome methylation of these 
animals.
RESULTS: It is observed that the different mCpG sites are mainly present in the 
intergenic and intronic regions between cloned and WT animals, and their CG-type 
methylation sites are strongly correlated. DMR (differentially methylated 
region) lengths are located around 1000 bp, mainly distributed in the 
exonic, intergenic and intronic functional domains. A total of 56 and 36 DMGs 
(differentially methylated genes) were identified by GO and KEGG databases, 
respectively. Functional annotation showed that DMGs were enriched in 
biological-process, cellular-component, molecular-function and other signaling 
pathways. A total of 10 identical genes related to growth and development were 
identified in GO and KEGG databases.
CONCLUSION: The differences in methylation genes among the tested animals have 
been identified. A total of 10 DMGs associated with growth and development were 
identified between cloned and WT animals. The results indicate that the 
differential patterns of DNA methylation between the cloned and WT goats are 
probably caused by the SCNT. These novel observations will help us to further 
identify the unveiled mechanisms of somatic cell cloning technology, 
particularly in goats.
