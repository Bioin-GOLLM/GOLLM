DOORS syndrome is characterized by deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, 
intellectual disability, and seizures. In this study, we report two unrelated 
individuals with DOORS syndrome without deafness. Exome sequencing revealed a 
homozygous missense variant in PIGF (NM_173074.3:c.515C>G, p.Pro172Arg) in both. 
We demonstrate impaired glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis through 
flow cytometry analysis. We thus describe the causal role of a novel disease 
gene, PIGF, in DOORS syndrome and highlight the overlap between this condition 
and GPI deficiency disorders. For each gene implicated in DOORS syndrome and/or 
inherited GPI deficiencies, there is considerable clinical variability so a high 
index of suspicion is warranted even though not all features are noted.
