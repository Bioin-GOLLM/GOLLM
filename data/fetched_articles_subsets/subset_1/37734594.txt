BACKGROUND & AIMS: The nuclear receptor coactivator 5 (NCOA5) is a putative type 
2 diabetes susceptibility gene. NCOA5 haploinsufficiency results in the 
spontaneous development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), insulin 
resistance, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in male mice; however, the 
cell-specific effect of NCOA5 haploinsufficiency in various types of cells, 
including macrophages, on the development of NAFLD and HCC remains unknown.
METHODS: Control and myeloid-lineage-specific Ncoa5 deletion (Ncoa5ΔM/+) mice 
fed a normal diet were examined for the development of NAFLD, nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), and HCC. Altered genes and signaling pathways in the 
intrahepatic macrophages of Ncoa5ΔM/+ male mice were analyzed and compared with 
those of obese human individuals. The role of platelet factor 4 (PF4) in 
macrophages and the underlying mechanism by which PF4 affects NAFLD/NASH were 
explored in vitro and in vivo. PF4 expression in HCC patient specimens and 
prognosis was examined.
RESULTS: Myeloid-lineage-specific Ncoa5 deletion sufficiently causes spontaneous 
NASH and HCC development in male mice fed a normal diet. PF4 overexpression in 
Ncoa5ΔM/+ intrahepatic macrophages is identified as a potent mediator to trigger 
lipid accumulation in hepatocytes by inducing lipogenesis-promoting gene 
expression. The transcriptome of intrahepatic macrophages from Ncoa5ΔM/+ male 
mice resembles that of obese human individuals. High PF4 expression correlated 
with poor prognosis of HCC patients and increased infiltrations of M2 
macrophages, regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in HCCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for the onset of NAFLD/NASH 
and HCC initiated by NCOA5-deficient macrophages, suggesting the NCOA5-PF4 axis 
in macrophages as a potential target for developing preventive and therapeutic 
interventions against NAFLD/NASH and HCC.
