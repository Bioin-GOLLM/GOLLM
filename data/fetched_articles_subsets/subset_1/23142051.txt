Through in vivo selection of human cancer cell populations, we uncover a 
convergent and cooperative miRNA network that drives melanoma metastasis. We 
identify miR-1908, miR-199a-5p, and miR-199a-3p as endogenous promoters of 
metastatic invasion, angiogenesis, and colonization in melanoma. These miRNAs 
convergently target apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the heat shock factor DNAJA4. 
Cancer-secreted ApoE suppresses invasion and metastatic endothelial recruitment 
(MER) by engaging melanoma cell LRP1 and endothelial cell LRP8 receptors, 
respectively, while DNAJA4 promotes ApoE expression. Expression levels of these 
miRNAs and ApoE correlate with human metastatic progression outcomes. Treatment 
of cells with locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting these miRNAs inhibits 
metastasis to multiple organs, and therapeutic delivery of these LNAs strongly 
suppresses melanoma metastasis. We thus identify miRNAs with dual 
cell-intrinsic/cell-extrinsic roles in cancer, reveal convergent cooperativity 
in a metastatic miRNA network, identify ApoE as an anti-angiogenic and 
metastasis-suppressive factor, and uncover multiple prognostic miRNAs with 
synergistic combinatorial therapeutic potential in melanoma.
