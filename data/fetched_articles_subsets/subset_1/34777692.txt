Metabolic energy production naturally generates unwanted products such as 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing oxidative damage. Oxidative damage has 
been linked to several pathologies, including diabetes, premature aging, 
neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. ROS were therefore originally 
anticipated as an imperative evil, a product of an imperfect system. More 
recently, however, the role of ROS in signaling and tumor treatment is 
increasingly acknowledged. This review addresses the main types, sources, and 
pathways of ROS in melanoma by linking their pleiotropic roles in antioxidant 
and oxidant regulation, hypoxia, metabolism, and cell death. In addition, the 
implications of ROS in various physical therapy modalities targeting melanoma, 
such as radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy, 
and medical gas plasma, are also discussed. By including ROS in the main picture 
of melanoma skin cancer and as an integral part of cancer therapies, a greater 
understanding of melanoma cell biology is presented, which ultimately may 
elucidate additional clues on targeting therapy resistance of this most deadly 
form of skin cancer.
