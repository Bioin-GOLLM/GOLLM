Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the etiological agent of TGE, and 
dogs are potential carriers of TGEV. In this study, genomic RNA were extracted 
from TGEV designated HYM-09 isolated from dog naturally infected with TGEV. The 
nucleocapsid (N) gene of HYM-09 was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pMD18-T 
vector. The N gene cDNA was sequenced and encompassed an open reading frame of 
1,149 nucleotides, encoding a 382-amino acids protein. Sequence analyses of the 
N genes were performed, including homologous comparison, phylogenetic tree 
analysis and residue substitution analysis. The results showed that there 
existed some unique mutations in the HYM-09 isolate N gene, but HYM-09 N gene 
shared over 96Â % homologous identities compared with 12 TGEV reference strains 
derived from other regions or countries respectively. The phylogenetic tree 
analysis revealed that the HYM-09 branched into the most strains group. This 
study shows that the nucleotide sequence analysis can form a base or further 
study on the mutation trend of non-porcine TGEV.
