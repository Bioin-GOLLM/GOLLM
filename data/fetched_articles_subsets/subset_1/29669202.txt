Understanding the functional relevance of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 
homodimerization has been limited by the insufficient tools to assess asymmetric 
signaling occurring within dimers comprised of the same receptor type. We 
present unmatched bivalent ligands (UmBLs) to study the asymmetric function of 
melanocortin homodimers. UmBLs contain one agonist and one antagonist 
pharmacophore designed to target a melanocortin homodimer such that one receptor 
is occupied by an agonist and the other receptor by an antagonist pharmacophore. 
First-in-class biased UmBLs (BUmBLs) targeting the human melanocortin-4 receptor 
(hMC4R) were discovered. The BUmBLs displayed biased agonism by potently 
stimulating cAMP signaling (EC50 ∼ 2-6 nM) but minimally activating the 
β-arrestin recruitment pathway (≤55% maximum signal at 10 μM). To our knowledge, 
we report the first single-compound strategy to pharmacologically target 
melanocortin receptor allosteric signaling that occurs between homodimers that 
can be applied straightforwardly in vitro and in vivo to other GPCR systems.
