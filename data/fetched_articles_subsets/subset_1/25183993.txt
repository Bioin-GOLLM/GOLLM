BACKGROUND: For over 400 years, due to the reassortment of their segmented 
genomes, influenza viruses evolve extremely quickly and cause devastating 
epidemics. This reassortment arises because two flu viruses can infect the same 
cell and therefore the new virions' genomes will be composed of segment 
reassortments of the two parental strains. A treatment developed against parents 
could then be ineffective if the virions' genomes are different enough from 
their parent's genomes. It is therefore essential to simulate such reassortment 
phenomena to assess the risk of apparition of new flu strain.
FINDINGS: So we decided to upgrade the forward simulator VIRAPOPS, containing 
already the necessary options to handle non-segmented viral populations. This 
new version can mimic single or successive reassortments, in birds, humans 
and/or swines. Other options such as the ability to treat populations of 
positive or negative sense viral RNAs, were also added. Finally, we propose 
output options giving statistics of the results.
CONCLUSION: In this paper we present a new version of VIRAPOPS which now manages 
the viral segment reassortments and the negative sense single strain RNA 
viruses, these two issues being the cause of serious public health problems.
