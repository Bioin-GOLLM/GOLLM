Clotting Factor V (FV) is primarily synthesized in the liver and when cleaved by 
thrombin forms pro-coagulant Factor Va (FVa). Using whole blood RNAseq 
and scRNAseq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we find that FV mRNA is 
expressed in leukocytes, and identify neutrophils, monocytes, and T regulatory 
cells as sources of increased FV in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 
Proteomic analysis confirms increased FV in circulating neutrophils in severe 
COVID-19, and immunofluorescence microscopy identifies FV in lung-infiltrating 
leukocytes in COVID-19 lung disease. Increased leukocyte FV expression in severe 
disease correlates with T-cell lymphopenia. Both plasma-derived and a cleavage 
resistant recombinant FV, but not thrombin cleaved FVa, suppress T-cell 
proliferation in vitro. Anticoagulants that reduce FV conversion to FVa, 
including heparin, may have the unintended consequence of suppressing the 
adaptive immune system.
