Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a viral infection that, when transmitted 
through the exchange of certain bodily fluids, destroys various immune cells and 
contributes to an overall weakened immune system. If left untreated, HIV 
progresses to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) - a chronic, 
life-threatening condition that puts patients at risk for opportunistic 
infections. Since the emergence of HIV nearly a century ago, the world has seen 
tremendous advances in elucidating its pathology and progression. These advances 
have been accompanied by an increased understanding of how subsequent effects 
and symptoms manifest in afflicted individuals. These discoveries, coupled with 
the ever-improving technologies and methodologies used for detection and 
treatment, provide the scientific and medical community with a solid grasp of 
HIV. Despite this significant headway, there is still much progress to be made; 
medical advances have allowed people with HIV to manage their disease and live a 
longer, healthier life, but a definite cure is yet to be found. Thus, the 
following literature review serves as both an extensive compendium of our 
current understanding of HIV - its pathology, testing/detection, repercussions, 
and treatment - and an acknowledgement of the areas that still require further 
research.
