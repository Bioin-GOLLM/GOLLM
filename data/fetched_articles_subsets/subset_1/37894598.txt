This review article describes a historical perspective of elucidation of the 
nature of the chemical bonds of the high-valent transition metal oxo (M=O) and 
peroxo (M-O-O) compounds in chemistry and biology. The basic concepts and 
theoretical backgrounds of the broken-symmetry (BS) method are revisited to 
explain orbital symmetry conservation and orbital symmetry breaking for the 
theoretical characterization of four different mechanisms of chemical reactions. 
Beyond BS methods using the natural orbitals (UNO) of the BS solutions, such as 
UNO CI (CC), are also revisited for the elucidation of the scope and 
applicability of the BS methods. Several chemical indices have been derived as 
the conceptual bridges between the BS and beyond BS methods. The BS molecular 
orbital models have been employed to explain the metal oxyl-radical character of 
the M=O and M-O-O bonds, which respond to their radical reactivity. The isolobal 
and isospin analogy between carbonyl oxide R2C-O-O and metal peroxide LFe-O-O 
has been applied to understand and explain the chameleonic chemical reactivity 
of these compounds. The isolobal and isospin analogy among Fe=O, O=O, and O have 
also provided the triplet atomic oxygen (3O) model for non-heme Fe(IV)=O species 
with strong radical reactivity. The chameleonic reactivity of the compounds I 
(Cpd I) and II (Cpd II) is also explained by this analogy. The early proposals 
obtained by these theoretical models have been examined based on recent 
computational results by hybrid DFT (UHDFT), DLPNO CCSD(T0), CASPT2, and UNO CI 
(CC) methods and quantum computing (QC).
