Ferrochelatase (FECH) is the terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis. We previously 
showed that FECH is required for endothelial cell growth in vitro and choroidal 
neovascularization in vivo. But FECH has not been explored in retinal 
neovascularization, which underlies diseases like proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Here, we investigated the inhibition 
of FECH using genetic and chemical approaches in the oxygen-induced retinopathy 
(OIR) mouse model. In OIR mice, FECH expression is upregulated and co-localized 
with neovascular tufts. Partial loss-of-function Fechm1Pas  mutant mice showed 
reduced retinal neovascularization and endothelial cell proliferation in OIR. An 
intravitreal injection of the FECH inhibitor N-methyl protoporphyrin had similar 
effects. Griseofulvin is an antifungal drug that inhibits FECH as an off-target 
effect. Strikingly, intravitreal griseofulvin decreased both pathological tuft 
formation and areas of vasoobliteration compared to vehicle, suggesting 
potential as a FECH-targeting therapy. Ocular toxicity studies revealed that 
intravitreal injection of griseofulvin in adult mice does not disrupt retinal 
vasculature, function, or morphology. In sum, mutation and chemical inhibition 
of Fech reduces retinal neovascularization and promotes physiological 
angiogenesis, suggesting a dual effect on vascular repair upon FECH inhibition, 
without ocular toxicity. These findings suggest that FECH inhibitors could be 
repurposed to treat retinal neovascularization.
