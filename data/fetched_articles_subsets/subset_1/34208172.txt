The envelope of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is required for the entry to 
hepatocytes, consists of a lipid bilayer derived from hepatocyte and HBV 
envelope proteins, large/middle/small hepatitis B surface antigen (L/M/SHBs). 
The mechanisms and host factors for the envelope formation in the hepatocytes 
are being revealed. HBV-infected hepatocytes release a large amount of subviral 
particles (SVPs) containing L/M/SHBs that facilitate escape from the immune 
system. Recently, novel drugs inhibiting the functions of the viral envelope and 
those inhibiting the release of SVPs have been reported. LHBs that accumulate in 
ER is considered to promote carcinogenesis and, especially, deletion mutants in 
the preS1/S2 domain have been reported to be associated with the development of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this review, we summarize recent reports on 
the findings regarding the biological characteristics of HBV envelope proteins, 
their involvement in HCC development and new agents targeting the envelope.
