BACKGROUND: Endothelial injury and permeability are a hallmark of sepsis. 
Initial resuscitation of septic patients with crystalloids is associated with 
aggravation of endothelial permeability, which may be related either to low 
protein content or to volume. We investigated whether initial resuscitation with 
different types of plasma or albumin decreases endothelial dysfunction and organ 
injury in a pneumosepsis rat model compared to the same volume of crystalloids.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were intratracheally inoculated 
with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, animals were 
randomized to 2 control groups and 5 intervention groups (n = 11 per group) to 
receive resuscitation with a fixed volume (8 mL/kg for 1 h) of either Ringer's 
Lactate, 5% human albumin, fresh frozen plasma derived from syngeneic donor rats 
(rFFP), human-derived plasma (hFFP) or human-derived solvent detergent plasma 
(SDP). Controls were non-resuscitated (n = 11) and healthy animals. Animals were 
sacrificed 5 h after start of resuscitation (T = 5). Pulmonary FITC-dextran 
leakage as a reflection of endothelial permeability was used as the primary 
outcome.
RESULTS: Inoculation with S. Pneumoniae resulted in sepsis, increased median 
lactate levels (1.6-2.8 mM, p < 0.01), pulmonary FITC-dextran leakage (52-134 µg 
mL-1, p < 0.05) and lung injury scores (0.7-6.9, p < 0.001) compared to healthy 
controls. Compared to animals receiving no resuscitation, animals resuscitated 
with rFFP had reduced pulmonary FITC leakage (134 vs 58 µg/mL, p = 0.011). 
However, there were no differences in any other markers of organ or endothelial 
injury. Resuscitation using different human plasma products or 5% albumin showed 
no differences in any outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Resuscitation with plasma did not reduce endothelial and organ 
injury when compared to an equal resuscitation volume of crystalloids. 
Rat-derived FFP may decrease pulmonary leakage induced by shock.
