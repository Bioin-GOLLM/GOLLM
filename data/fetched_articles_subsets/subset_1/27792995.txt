There are significant inter-individual differences in the levels of gene 
expression. Through modulation of gene expression, cis-acting variants represent 
an important source of phenotypic variation. Consequently, cis-regulatory SNPs 
associated with differential allelic expression are functional candidates for 
further investigation as disease-causing variants. To investigate whether common 
variants associated with differential allelic expression were involved in breast 
cancer susceptibility, a list of genes was established on the basis of their 
involvement in cancer related pathways and/or mechanisms. Thereafter, using data 
from a genome-wide map of allelic expression associated SNPs, 313 genetic 
variants were selected and their association with breast cancer risk was then 
evaluated in 46,451 breast cancer cases and 42,599 controls of European ancestry 
ascertained from 41 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association 
Consortium. The associations were evaluated with overall breast cancer risk and 
with estrogen receptor negative and positive disease. One novel breast cancer 
susceptibility locus on 4q21 (rs11099601) was identified (OR = 1.05, P = 
5.6x10-6). rs11099601 lies in a 135 kb linkage disequilibrium block containing 
several genes, including, HELQ, encoding the protein HEL308 a DNA dependant 
ATPase and DNA Helicase involved in DNA repair, MRPS18C encoding the 
Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein S18C and FAM175A (ABRAXAS), encoding a BRCA1 
BRCT domain-interacting protein involved in DNA damage response and 
double-strand break (DSB) repair. Expression QTL analysis in breast cancer 
tissue showed rs11099601 to be associated with HELQ (P = 8.28x10-14), MRPS18C (P 
= 1.94x10-27) and FAM175A (P = 3.83x10-3), explaining about 20%, 14% and 1%, 
respectively of the variance inexpression of these genes in breast carcinomas.
