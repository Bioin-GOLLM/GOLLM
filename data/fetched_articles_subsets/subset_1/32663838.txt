After two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) 
is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no 
single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps 
persist1,2. Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the 
continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a 
human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore 
sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with 
complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our 
efforts on the human X chromosome3, we reconstructed the centromeric satellite 
DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current 
reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and 
from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences 
will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the 
complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to 
map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our 
results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, 
and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the 
other human chromosomes.
