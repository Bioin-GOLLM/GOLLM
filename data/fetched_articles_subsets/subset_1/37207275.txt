Salivary gland cancers (SGCs) are heterogeneous tumors, and precision oncology 
represents a promising therapeutic approach; however, its impact on SGCs remains 
obscure. This study aimed to establish a translational model for testing 
molecular-targeted therapies by combining patient-derived organoids and genomic 
analyses of SGCs. We enrolled 29 patients, including 24 with SGCs and 5 with 
benign tumors. Resected tumors were subjected to organoid and monolayer 
cultures, as well as whole-exome sequencing. Organoid and monolayer cultures of 
SGCs were successfully established in 70.8% and 62.5% of cases, respectively. 
Organoids retained most histopathological and genetic profiles of their original 
tumors. In contrast, 40% of the monolayer-cultured cells did not harbor somatic 
mutations of their original tumors. The efficacy of molecular-targeted drugs 
tested on organoids depended on their oncogenic features. Organoids 
recapitulated the primary tumors and were useful for testing genotype-oriented 
molecular targeted therapy, which is valuable for precision medicine in patients 
with SGCs.
