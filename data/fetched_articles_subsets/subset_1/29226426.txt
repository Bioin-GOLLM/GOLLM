Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 × 109 /L) is associated with very poor 
outcome of patients with myelofibrosis (MF). As patients with primary 
myelofibrosis (PMF) differ from patients with postessential thrombocythemia 
(PET-MF) and postpolycythemia vera myelofibrosis (PPV-MF), we aimed to evaluate 
the significance of low platelets among these patients. We present clinical 
characteristics and outcome of patients with either PMF, PPV-MF, or PET-MF, and 
thrombocytopenia who presented to our institution between 1984 and 2015. Of 1269 
patients (877 PMF, 212 PPV-MF, 180 PET-MF), 11% and 14% had platelets either 
<50 × 109 /L or between 50-100 × 109 /L, respectively. Patients with platelets 
<50 × 109 /L were most anemic and transfusion dependent, had highest blast count 
and unfavorable karyotype. In general, their overall and leukemia-free survival 
was the shortest with median time of 15 and 13 months, respectively; with 
incidence of acute leukemia almost twice as high as in the remaining patients 
(6.9 vs 3.6 cases per 100 person-years). Nevertheless, this observation remains 
mostly significant for patients with PMF, as those with PEV/PVT-MF have already 
significantly inferior prognosis with platelets <100 × 109 /L.
