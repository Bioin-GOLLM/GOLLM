BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common primary intraocular 
malignancy in adults and is highly metastatic, resulting in a poor patient 
prognosis. Sphingolipid metabolism plays an important role in tumor development, 
diagnosis, and prognosis. This study aimed to establish a reliable signature 
based on sphingolipid metabolism genes (SMGs), thus providing a new perspective 
for assessing immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with UVM.
METHODS: In this study, SMGs were used to classify UVM from the TCGA-UVM and GEO 
cohorts. Genes significantly associated with prognosis in UVM patients were 
screened using univariate cox regression analysis. The most significantly 
characterized genes were obtained by machine learning, and 4-SMGs prognosis 
signature was constructed by stepwise multifactorial cox. External validation 
was performed in the GSE84976 cohort. The level of immune infiltration of 4-SMGs 
in high- and low-risk patients was analyzed by platforms such as CIBERSORT. The 
prediction of 4-SMGs on immunotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) 
response in UVM patients was assessed by ImmuCellAI and TIP portals.
RESULTS: 4-SMGs were considered to be strongly associated with the prognosis of 
UVM and were good predictors of UVM prognosis. Multivariate analysis found that 
the model was an independent predictor of UVM, with patients in the low-risk 
group having higher overall survival than those in the high-risk group. The 
nomogram constructed from clinical characteristics and risk scores had good 
prognostic power. The high-risk group showed better results when receiving 
immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: 4-SMGs signature and nomogram showed excellent predictive 
performance and provided a new perspective for assessing pre-immune efficacy, 
which will facilitate future precision immuno-oncology studies.
