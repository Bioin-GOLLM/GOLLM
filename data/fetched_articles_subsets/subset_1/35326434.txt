Over the past decades, a better understanding of the genetic and molecular 
alterations underlying several respiratory diseases has encouraged the 
development of new therapeutic strategies. Gene therapy offers new therapeutic 
alternatives for inherited and acquired diseases by delivering exogenous genetic 
materials into cells or tissues to restore physiological protein expression 
and/or activity. In this review, we review (1) different types of viral and 
non-viral vectors as well as gene-editing techniques; and (2) the application of 
gene therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases and disorders, including 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, 
asthma, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
non-small-cell lung cancer, and COVID-19. Further, we also provide specific 
examples of lung-targeted therapies and discuss the major limitations of gene 
therapy.
