How misfolded proteins are exported from the ER to the cytosol for degradation 
(ER-associated Degradation, ERAD) and which proteins are participating in this 
process is not understood. Several studies using a single, leaky mutant 
indicated that Sec63p might be involved in ERAD. More recently, Sec63p was also 
found strongly associated with proteasomes attached to the protein-conducting 
channel in the ER membrane which presumably form part of the export machinery. 
These observations prompted us to reinvestigate the role of Sec63p in ERAD by 
generating new mutants which were selected in a screen monitoring the 
intracellular accumulation of the ERAD substrate CPY*. We show that a mutation 
in the DnaJ-domain of Sec63p causes a defect in ERAD, whereas mutations in the 
Brl, acidic, and transmembrane domains only affect protein import into the ER. 
Unexpectedly, mutations in the acidic domain which mediates interaction of 
Sec63p with Sec62p also caused defects in cotranslational import. In contrast to 
mammalian cells where SEC63 expression levels affect steady-state levels of 
multi-spanning transmembrane proteins, the sec63 J-domain mutant was only 
defective in ERAD of soluble substrates.
