in the Basque Country, but relative prevalence is determined by ethnicity.

Mutations in LRRK2 gene are the most frequent cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
described, but their prevalence varies between populations. Patients, 418, with 
PD and 138 unrelated controls from the Basque Country were screened for LRRK2 
G2019S and R1441G mutations. Of the patients, 3.82% were heterozygous carriers 
of G2019S and 13.15% of R1441G. G2019S frequency was higher in non-Basque 
population (6.0%), while R1441G was more common in Basque origin population 
(22.4%). Our conclusion is that both G2019S and R1441G mutations' frequency 
varies markedly between Basque and non-Basque origin population reinforcing the 
importance of ethnicity consideration when establishing mutation prevalence.
