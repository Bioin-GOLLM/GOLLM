Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving 
multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome 
sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a 
polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive 
mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include 
the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the 
activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the 
postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and 
copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the 
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for 
case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after 
correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately 
low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. 
Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can 
discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in 
neuropsychiatric disease.
