Candida albicans (C. albicans), a ubiquitous polymorphic fungus in humans, 
causes different types of candidiasis, including oral candidiasis (OC) and 
vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), which are physically and mentally concerning and 
financially costly. Thus, developing alternative antifungals that prevent drug 
resistance and induce immunity to eliminate Candida biofilms is crucial. Herein, 
a novel membrane-targeted aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer 
(PS), TBTCP-QY, is developed for highly efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of 
candidiasis. TBTCP-QY has a high molar absorption coefficient and an excellent 
ability to generate 1 O2 and •OH, entering the interior of biofilms due to its 
high permeability. Furthermore, TBTCP-QY can efficiently inhibit biofilm 
formation by suppressing the expression of genes related to the adhesion (ALS3, 
EAP1, and HWP1), invasion (SAP1 and SAP2), and drug resistance (MDR1) of C. 
albicans, which is also advantageous for eliminating potential fungal resistance 
to treat clinical infectious diseases. TBTCP-QY-mediated PDT efficiently targets 
OC and VVC in vivo in a mouse model, induces immune response, relieves 
inflammation, and accelerates the healing of mucosal defects to combat 
infections caused by clinically isolated fluconazole-resistant strains. 
Moreover, TBTCP-QY demonstrates excellent biocompatibility, suggesting its 
potential applications in the clinical treatment of OC and VVC.
