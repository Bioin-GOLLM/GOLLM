BACKGROUND: Melanoma is the most lethal type of skin cancer. Since 
chemoresistance is a significant barrier, identification of regulators affecting 
chemosensitivity is necessary in order to create new forms of intervention. 
Prohibitin 1 (PHB1) can act as anti-apoptotic or tumor suppressor molecule, 
depending on its subcellular localization. Our recent data shown that 
accumulation of PHB1 protects melanoma cells from chemotherapy-induced cell 
death. Lacking of post-transcriptional regulation of PHB1 could explain this 
accumulation. Interestingly, most of melanoma patients have down-regulation of 
microRNA-195. Here, we investigate the role of miR-195, its impact on PHB1 
expression, and on chemosensitivity in melanoma cells.
METHODS: TCGA-RNAseq data obtained from 341 melanoma patient samples as well as 
a panel of melanoma cell lines were used in an expression correlation analysis 
between PHB1 and predicted miRNAs. miR-195 impact on PHB1 mRNA and protein 
levels and relevance of this regulation were investigated in UACC-62 and 
SK-MEL-5 melanoma lines by RT-qPCR and western blot, luciferase reporter and 
genetic rescue experiments. Cell proliferation, cell-cycle analysis and caspase 
3/7 assay were performed to investigate the potential action of miR-195 as 
chemosensitizer in melanoma cells treated with cisplatin and temozolomide.
RESULTS: Analysis of the TCGA-RNAseq revealed a significant negative correlation 
(Pearson) between miR-195 and PHB1 expression. Moreover, RT-qPCR data showed 
that miR-195 is down-regulated while PHB1 is up-regulated in a collection of 
melanoma cells. We demonstrated that miR-195 regulates PHB1 directly by RT-qPCR 
and western blot in melanoma cells and luciferase assays. To establish PHB1 as a 
relevant target of miR-195, we conducted rescue experiments in which we showed 
that PHB1 transgenic expression could antagonize the suppressive effect miR-195 
on the proliferation of melanoma cells. Finally, transfection experiments 
combined with drug treatments performed in the UACC-62 and SK-MEL-5 melanoma 
cells corroborated miR-195 as potential anti-proliferative agent, with potential 
impact in sensitization of melanoma cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: This study support the role of miR-195 as anti-proliferative miRNA 
via targeting of PHB1 in melanoma cells.
