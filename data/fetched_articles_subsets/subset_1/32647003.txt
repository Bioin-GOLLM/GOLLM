Immunodeficiency often coincides with hyperactive immune disorders such as 
autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation, or atopy, but this coincidence is rarely 
understood on a molecular level. We describe five patients from four families 
with immunodeficiency coupled with atopy, lymphoproliferation, and cytokine 
overproduction harboring mutations in NCKAP1L, which encodes the 
hematopoietic-specific HEM1 protein. These mutations cause the loss of the HEM1 
protein and the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) or disrupt binding to the WRC 
regulator, Arf1, thereby impairing actin polymerization, synapse formation, and 
immune cell migration. Diminished cortical actin networks caused by WRC loss led 
to uncontrolled cytokine release and immune hyperresponsiveness. HEM1 loss also 
blocked mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-dependent AKT 
phosphorylation, T cell proliferation, and selected effector functions, leading 
to immunodeficiency. Thus, the evolutionarily conserved HEM1 protein 
simultaneously regulates filamentous actin (F-actin) and mTORC2 signaling to 
achieve equipoise in immune responses.
