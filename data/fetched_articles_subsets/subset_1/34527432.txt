BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of broad-spectrum ampicillin-resistant and 
third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, particularly 
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, has become a global concern, with 
its clinical impacts on both human and veterinary medicine. This study examined 
the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and molecular genetic features of 
extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae 
isolates from 10 types of raw vegetables.
METHODS: In total, 305 samples were collected from 9 markets in Nakhon Si 
Thammarat, Thailand, in 2020.
RESULTS: ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were found in 14 of 
the 305 samples obtained from 7 out of 10 types of vegetables (4.6% of the 
total). Further, 14 ESBL-producing E. coli (n = 5/14) and K. pneumoniae isolates 
(n = 9/14) (1.6% and 3.0%, respectively) were highly sensitive to 
β-lactam/carbapenem antibiotics (imipenem, 100%). ESBL-producing E. coli (n = 4) 
and K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 8) were also sensitive to non-β-lactam 
aminoglycosides (amikacin, 80.00% and 88.89%, respectively). ESBL producers were 
most resistant to β-lactam antibiotics, including ampicillin (85.71%) and the 
cephalosporins cefotaxime and ceftazidime (64.29%). The most frequently detected 
gene in ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae was blaSHV . However, two 
ESBL-producing E. coli isolates also carried three other ESBL-encoding variants, 
blaTEM , blaCTX-M1 , blaGES and blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M9 , which may be due to 
their association with food chains and humans.
DISCUSSION: Indeed, our results suggest that raw vegetables are an important 
source of ESBL-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which are potentially 
transmittable to humans via raw vegetable intake.
