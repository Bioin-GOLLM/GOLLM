Age-related macular degeneration(AMD) is one of the main leading causes of 
irreversible vision damage in patients over 50 years old. Genetic factors play 
an important role in the occurrence and development of AMD. Since the 
significant correlation between complement factor H (CFH) gene and AMD was 
found, the pharmacogenomics of CFH polymorphism was paid close attention by 
academic circles. Among which, studies concerning CFH Y402H were more deeply. 
Studies have found CFH Y402H genotypes might lead to differences toward the 
outcome of PDT and anti-VEGF treatment. In this article, we review the 
researches on the pharmacogenomics of CFH Y402H in wet AMD treatment. (Chin J 
Ophthalmol, 2017, 53: 144-147).

AMD是50岁以上人群发生视力不可逆性损伤的主要原因之一。遗传因素在AMD的发生、发展中起到了重要的作用。自发现补体因子H（CFH）基因与AMD的发生具有显著相关性后，学界开始关注CFH基因多态性对AMD治疗的影响，其中关于CFH 
Y402H基因的研究较为深入。多项研究发现CFH Y402H不同基因型对光动力治疗及抗VEGF治疗效果存在差异。现就CHF 
Y402H基因在湿性AMD药物遗传学方面的研究进展进行综述。（中华眼科杂志，2017，53：144-147）.
