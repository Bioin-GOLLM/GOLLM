5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is derived from the essential amino acid 
L-tryptophan. Although the compound has been studied extensively for its 
neuronal handling and synaptic actions, serotonin 5-HT receptors can be found 
extra-synaptically and not only in neurons but in many types of mammalian cells, 
inside and outside the central nervous system (CNS). In sharp contrast, 
glutamate (Glu) and ATP are better known as metabolism-related molecules, but 
they also are neurotransmitters, and their receptors are expressed on almost any 
type of cell inside and outside the nervous system. Whereas 5-hydroxytryptamine 
and Glu are key regulators of the immune system, ATP actions are more general. 
5-hydroxytryptamine, ATP and Glu act through both G protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCRs), and ionotropic receptors, i.e., ligand gated ion channels. These are 
the three examples of neurotransmitters whose actions as holistic regulatory 
molecules are briefly put into perspective here.
