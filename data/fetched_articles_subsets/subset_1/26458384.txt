Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease resulting from T cell-mediated 
destruction of insulin-producing beta cells within pancreatic islets. Disease 
incidence has increased significantly in the last two decades, especially in 
young children. Type 1 diabetes is now predictable in humans with the 
measurement of serum islet autoantibodies directed against insulin and beta cell 
proteins. Knowledge regarding the presentation of insulin and islet antigens to 
T cells has increased dramatically over the last several years. Here, we review 
the trimolecular complex in diabetes, which consists of a major 
histocompatibility molecule,self-peptide, and T cell receptor, with a focus on 
insulin peptide presentation to T cells. With this increased understanding of 
how antigens are presented to T cells comes the hope for improved therapies for 
type 1 diabetes prevention.
