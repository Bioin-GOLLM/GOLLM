The multiple myeloma treatment landscape has changed dramatically. This change, 
paralleled by an increase in scientific knowledge, has resulted in significant 
improvement in survival. However, heterogeneity remains in clinical outcomes, 
with a proportion of patients not benefiting from current approaches and 
continuing to have a poor prognosis. A significant proportion of the variability 
in outcome can be predicted on the basis of clinical and biochemical parameters 
and tumor-acquired genetic variants, allowing for risk stratification and a more 
personalized approach to therapy. This article discusses the principles that can 
enable the rational and effective development of therapeutic approaches for 
high-risk multiple myeloma.
