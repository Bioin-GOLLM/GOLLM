The Japanese greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus nippon) is distributed widely in 
East Asia. Within the species, R. nippon in Northeast Asia is regarded as the 
lineage that diverged most recently. However, the monophyly of the Japanese 
populations is unclear due to insufficient data about phylogenetic relationship 
of the western Japanese populations. To test the monophyly of the Japanese 
populations of R. nippon, we sampled R. nippon from western Japan and performed 
a phylogeographic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and the 
D-loop. The Northeast Asian lineage consisted of three main clades in eastern 
Japan (clade I), western Japan (clade II), and the continent as well as the 
Kumamoto population in westernmost Japan (clade III). The results of this study 
do not support the monophyly of the Japanese population. The findings suggest 
the "reverse colonization" of R. nippon from the Japanese Archipelago to the 
Eurasian continent, and provide important insight into the role of the island 
system in creation and supply of diversity to the continent.
