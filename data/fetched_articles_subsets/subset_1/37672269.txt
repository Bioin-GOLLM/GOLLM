IMPORTANCE: Liver cancer, primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the third 
leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although some studies have proposed 
that antidepressants may have apoptotic effects on cancer, no study has examined 
the association between antidepressant use and HCC prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between antidepressant use and 
mortality risk in patients with HCC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This population-based cohort study analyzed 
Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, which covers 99% of 
Taiwan's population and includes comprehensive medical information. Patients 
with a new diagnosis of HCC between 1999 and 2017 were identified. Analysis took 
place in June 2023.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All patients with HCC were followed up until 2018 to 
measure overall and cancer-specific mortality. To examine whether the timing of 
antidepressant use influenced the association with mortality, antidepressant use 
was examined before and after HCC diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards regression 
was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% CIs for the 
association between antidepressant use and overall mortality and cancer-specific 
mortality.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 308 938 participants, primarily consisting 
of older individuals (131 991 [42.7%] were aged ≥65 years) with a higher 
proportion of male individuals (202 589 [65.6%]). Antidepressant use before the 
diagnosis of HCC was not associated with lower risks of overall mortality 
(adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.08-1.12) and cancer-specific mortality (adjusted 
HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.96-1.17). However, antidepressant use after a diagnosis of 
HCC was associated with a lower risk of overall mortality (adjusted HR, 0.69; 
95% CI, 0.68-0.70) and cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 
0.59-0.68). The observed associations were consistent across subgroups with 
different antidepressant classes and comorbidities, including hepatitis B virus 
or hepatitis C virus infection, liver cirrhosis, and alcohol use disorders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on this nationwide cohort study, postdiagnosis 
antidepressant use may be associated with lower mortality in patients with HCC. 
Further randomized clinical trial evaluation should be considered.
