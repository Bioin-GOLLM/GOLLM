Tuning diastereoselectivity is a great challenge in asymmetric catalysis for the 
inherent stereochemical bias of the substrates. Here, we report a 
diastereodivergent asymmetric Mannich reaction of cyclic N-sulfonyl ketimines 
with ketones catalyzed by a bispidine-based chiral amine catalyst, in which 
additional water switches the diastereoselectivity efficiently. Both chiral 
anti- and syn-benzosultams with potential anti-HIV-1 activity are obtained in 
excellent yields and good to excellent ee values. Control experiments and 
density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to study the 
diastereodivergent mechanism, which reveal that the diastereodivergent catalysis 
should be state-determined, and the water reverses the energies of states to 
realize the diastereodivergency. The findings are quite new and might inspire 
more diastereodivergent asymmetric synthesis.
