Thymidylate is synthesized de novo in all living organisms for replication of 
genomes. The chemical transformation is reductive methylation of deoxyuridylate 
at C5 to form deoxythymidylate. All eukaryotes including humans complete this 
well-understood transformation with thymidylate synthase utilizing 
6R-N5-N10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate as both a source of methylene and a 
reducing hydride. In 2002, flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase was discovered 
as a new pathway for de novo thymidylate synthesis. The flavin-dependent 
catalytic mechanism is different than thymidylate synthase because it requires 
flavin as a reducing agent and methylene transporter. This catalytic mechanism 
is not well-understood, but since it is known to be very different from 
thymidylate synthase, there is potential for mechanism-based inhibitors that can 
selectively inhibit the flavin-dependent enzyme to target many human pathogens 
with low host toxicity.
