Vitamin A metabolites play important roles in T cell activation and 
differentiation. A conventional model of RARα function relies upon retinoic acid 
(RA)-liganded RARα binding to specific DNA motifs to regulate gene expression in 
the nucleus. However, this genomic function fails to explain many of the 
biological responses of the RA-RARα axis on T cells. We generated a mouse line 
where RARα is over-expressed in T cells to probe RARα function with 
unprecedented sensitivity. Using this model together with mice specifically 
lacking RARα in T cells, we found that RARα is required for prompt exit from 
metabolic quiescence in resting T cells upon T cell activation. The positive 
effect of RARα on metabolism is mediated through PI3K and subsequent activation 
of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathway. This largely non-genomic function of RARα 
is surprisingly ligand-independent and controls the differentiation of effector 
and regulatory T cell subsets.
