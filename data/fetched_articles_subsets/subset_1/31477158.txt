Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) can measure the regulatory function 
of thousands of DNA sequences in a single experiment. Despite growing 
popularity, MPRA studies are limited by a lack of a unified framework for 
analyzing the resulting data. Here we present MPRAnalyze: a statistical 
framework for analyzing MPRA count data. Our model leverages the unique 
structure of MPRA data to quantify the function of regulatory sequences, compare 
sequences' activity across different conditions, and provide necessary 
flexibility in an evolving field. We demonstrate the accuracy and applicability 
of MPRAnalyze on simulated and published data and compare it with existing 
methods.
