The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of sheep follicular fluid (SFF) 
supplementation of the in vitro maturation (IVM) media of sheep oocytes on the 
resumption of meiosis, glutathione (GSH) level, and expression of apoptosis 
(Bax, Bcl-2) as well as heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) genes. Sheep ovaries 
were collected from the central slaughterhouse of Riyadh city, KSA. Oocytes were 
aspirated from 3 to 8 mm follicles. Sheep oocytes were cultured in maturation 
medium with different concentrations of sheep follicular fluid: 0% (control), 
10%, 20% and 40% for 24 h. The results indicated that the maturation rate of 
oocytes was significantly (p ≤ .05) decreased in 40% SFF (36.87%) versus the 
control (61.3%), 10% SFF (63.95%) and 20% SFF (64.08%). The supplementation of 
the IVM medium with 10% SFF induced an intra-oocyte GSH concentration that was 
significantly higher than in sheep oocytes cultured with 20% and 40% SFF and 
similar to the GSH content in oocytes cultured without SFF. Real-time polymerase 
chain reaction analysis of gene expression revealed no significant differences 
in the Bax and HSPB1 genes between the control and 10% SFF, whereas they were 
significantly higher in 40% FF (p ≤ .05) compared to the control. The expression 
of Bax:Bcl-2 was significantly higher in 20% and 40% SFF compared to the control 
group. In conclusion, the addition of SFF to the IVM culture of sheep oocytes is 
recommended to support nuclear maturation and increase oocyte competence.
