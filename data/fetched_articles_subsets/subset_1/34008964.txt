The extensive length, compaction, and interwound nature of DNA, together with 
its controlled and restricted movement in eukaryotic cells, create a number of 
topological issues that profoundly affect all of the functions of the genetic 
material. Topoisomerases are essential enzymes that modulate the topological 
structure of the double helix, including the regulation of DNA under- and 
overwinding and the removal of tangles and knots from the genome. Type II 
topoisomerases alter DNA topology by generating a transient double-stranded 
break in one DNA segment and allowing another segment to pass through the DNA 
gate. These enzymes are involved in a number of critical nuclear processes in 
eukaryotic cells, such as DNA replication, transcription, and recombination, and 
are required for proper chromosome structure and segregation. However, because 
type II topoisomerases generate double-stranded breaks in the genetic material, 
they also are intrinsically dangerous enzymes that have the capacity to fragment 
the genome. As a result of this dualistic nature, type II topoisomerases are the 
targets for a number of widely prescribed anticancer drugs. This article will 
describe the structure and catalytic mechanism of eukaryotic type II 
topoisomerases and will go on to discuss the actions of topoisomerase II 
poisons, which are compounds that stabilize DNA breaks generated by the type II 
enzyme and convert these essential enzymes into "molecular scissors." 
Topoisomerase II poisons represent a broad range of structural classes and 
include anticancer drugs, dietary components, and environmental chemicals.
