BACKGROUND: The fourth edition of the ''WHO Classification of Head and Neck 
Tumours'' was published in January 2017 and includes a classification of 
odontogenic tumours. This review aims to examine the changes made in this new 
classification in comparison with the previous classification of 2005.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted in the PubMed, Scopus 
and Cochrane databases with the keywords "odontogenic tumor", "WHO 
classification" and "update". Studies published from January 2009 to April 2019 
with a high level of scientific evidence were included, but studies not 
published in English, epidemiological studies and studies with a low level of 
evidence were excluded.
RESULTS: The initial search found 457 articles and after eliminating duplicates, 
8 studies were selected for full-text assessment. After excluding 3 
epidemiological studies, 5 articles were finally included. These studies were 
stratified by their level of scientific evidence using SORT criteria (Strength 
of Recommendation Taxonomy).
CONCLUSIONS: The new odontogenic tumour list has been simplified with the 
objective of improving its role as an international guide for diagnosis. Some 
changes have been possible thanks to the application of immunohistochemistry and 
molecular genetic techniques that allow better characterization of certain 
tumours. Further clinicopathological and molecular studies are needed so that 
this new classification can be consolidated and/or amended.
