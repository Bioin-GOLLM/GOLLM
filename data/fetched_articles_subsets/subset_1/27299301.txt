BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction may play a central role in the pathologic 
process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is still a scarcity of data that 
directly links the pathology of AD with the alteration of mitochondrial DNA. 
This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of mtDNA rearrangement 
events in AD brain tissue.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmortem frozen human brain cerebral cortex samples were 
obtained from the Banner Sun Health Research Institute Brain and Body Donation 
Program, Sun City, AZ. Mitochondria were isolated and direct sequence by using 
MiSeqÂ®, and analyzed by relative software.
RESULTS: Three types of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangements have been seen 
in post mortem human brain tissue from patients with AD and age matched control. 
These observed rearrangements include a deletion, F-type rearrangement, and 
R-type rearrangement. We detected a high level of mtDNA rearrangement in brain 
tissue from cognitively normal subjects, as well as the patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The rate of rearrangements was calculated by dividing 
the number of positive rearrangements by the coverage depth. The rearrangement 
rate was significantly higher in AD brain tissue than in control brain tissue 
(17.9%versus 6.7%; p = 0.0052). Of specific types of rearrangement, deletions 
were markedly increased in AD (9.2% versus 2.3%; p = 0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that failure of mitochondrial DNA in AD brain might 
be important etiology of AD pathology.
