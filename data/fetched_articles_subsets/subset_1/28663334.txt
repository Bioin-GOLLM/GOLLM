Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and polymorphisms contribute to many complex 
diseases, including cancer. Using a unique mouse model that contains nDNA from 
one mouse strain and homoplasmic mitochondrial haplotypes from different mouse 
strain(s)-designated Mitochondrial Nuclear Exchange (MNX)-we showed that mtDNA 
could alter mammary tumor metastasis. Because retrograde and anterograde 
communication exists between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, we 
hypothesized that there are differential mtDNA-driven changes in nuclear (n)DNA 
expression and DNA methylation. Genome-wide nDNA methylation and gene expression 
were measured in harvested brain tissue from paired wild-type and MNX mice. 
Selective differential DNA methylation and gene expression were observed between 
strains having identical nDNA, but different mtDNA. These observations provide 
insights into how mtDNA could be altering epigenetic regulation and thereby 
contribute to the pathogenesis of metastasis. Cancer Res; 77(22); 6202-14. ©2017
