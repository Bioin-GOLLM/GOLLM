Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health concern in the 21st 
century, especially due to drug resistance, coinfection with diseases like 
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and coronavirus disease 2019, and the lengthy 
and costly treatment protocols. In this review, we summarize the pathogenesis of 
TB infection, therapeutic targets, and corresponding modulators, including 
first-line medications, current clinical trial drugs and molecules in 
preclinical assessment. Understanding the mechanisms of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and important biological targets can lead to 
innovative treatments. While most antitubercular agents target pathogen-related 
processes, host-directed therapy (HDT) modalities addressing immune defense, 
survival mechanisms, and immunopathology also hold promise. Mtb's adaptation to 
the human host involves manipulating host cellular mechanisms, and HDT aims to 
disrupt this manipulation to enhance treatment effectiveness. Our review 
provides valuable insights for future anti-TB drug development efforts.
