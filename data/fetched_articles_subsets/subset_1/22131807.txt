We review the use of thin filament-reconstituted muscle fibers in the study of 
muscle physiology. Thin filament extraction and reconstitution protocol is a 
powerful technique to study the role of each component of the thin filament. It 
is also useful for studying the properties of genetically modified molecules 
such as actin and tropomyosin. We also review the combination of this protocol 
with sinusoidal analysis, which will provide a solid technique for determining 
the effect of regulatory proteins on actomyosin interaction and concomitant 
cross-bridge kinetics. We suggest that thin filament-reconstituted muscle fibers 
are an ideal system for studying muscle physiology especially when gene 
modifications of actin or tropomyosin are involved.
