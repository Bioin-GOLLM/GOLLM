OBJECTIVE: The polymorphisms/mutations of genes encoding proteins and enzymes 
involved in lipoprotein metabolism play important roles in the development of 
diabetic dyslipidemia. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of 
LPL (rs320), LIPC (rs2070895), SCARB1 (rs5888), LCAT (rs2292318), CETP 
(rs708272), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), RETN (rs3745367), PON1 (rs662), and MNSOD 
(rs4880) gene polymorphisms on lipid metabolism and diabetic dyslipidemia.
METHODS: This case-control study included 217 patients with diabetic 
dyslipidemia and 212 healthy age- and gender-matched individuals. Genomic DNA 
isolation was performed from blood samples, and genotype analysis was performed 
using melting curve analysis on a LightCycler® 480 Instrument. The chi-square 
test was used to compare genotype distribution and allele frequencies between 
the groups.
RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between LPL (rs320) (p<0.001), 
LIPC (rs2070895) (p<0.001), SCARB1 (rs5888) (p<0.001), LCAT (rs2292318) 
(p<0.001), CETP (rs708272) (p<0.001), ADIPOQ (rs1501299) (p=0.01), RETN 
(rs3745367) (p<0.001), and MNSOD (rs4880) (p<0.001) polymorphisms and diabetic 
dyslipidemia. However, no association was observed between PON1 (rs662) 
polymorphisms and diabetic dyslipidemia (p=0.611).
CONCLUSION: LPL (rs320), LIPC (rs2070895), SCARB1 (rs5888), LCAT (rs2292318), 
CETP (rs708272), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), RETN (rs3745367), and MNSOD (rs4880) 
polymorphisms play an important role in basic molecular metabolism in diabetic 
dyslipidemia. Therefore, these polymorphisms may be used as a predictive marker 
for diabetic dyslipidemia in high-risk patients.
