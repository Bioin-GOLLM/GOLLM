Intratumor heterogeneity presents a major hurdle in cancer therapy. Most current 
research studies consider tumors as single entities and overlook molecular 
diversity between heterogeneous state(s) of different cells assumed to be 
homogenous. The present approach was designed for fluorescence-activated cell 
sorting-based resolution of heterogeneity arising from cancer stem cell (CSC) 
hierarchies and genetic instability in ovarian tumors, followed by 
microarray-based expression profiling of sorted fractions. Through weighted gene 
correlation network analyses, we could assign enriched modules of co-regulated 
genes to each fraction. Such gene modules often correlate with biological 
functions; one such specific association was the enrichment of CD53 expression 
in CSCs, functional validation indicated CD53 to be a tumor-initiating cell- 
rather than quiescent CSC-marker. Another association defined a state of poise 
for stress-induced metastases in aneuploid cells. Our results thus emphasize the 
need for studying cell-specific functionalities relevant to regeneration, drug 
resistance and disease progression in discrete tumor cell fractions.
