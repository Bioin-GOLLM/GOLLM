In contrast to the regulation of calcium homeostasis, which has been extensively 
studied over the past several decades, relatively little is known about the 
regulation of phosphate homeostasis. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is part 
of a previously unrecognized hormonal bone-parathyroid-kidney axis, which is 
modulated by PTH, 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), dietary and serum 
phosphorus levels. Synthesis and secretion of FGF23 by osteocytes are positively 
regulated by 1,25(OH)(2)D and serum phosphorus and negatively regulated, through 
yet unknown mechanisms, by the phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to 
endopeptidases on the X chromosome (PHEX) and by dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1). 
In turn, FGF23 inhibits the synthesis of 1,25(OH)(2)D, and it may negatively 
regulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid glands. 
However, FGF23 synergizes with PTH to increase renal phosphate excretion by 
reducing expression of the renal sodium-phosphate cotransporters NaPi-IIa and 
NaPi-IIc in the proximal tubules. Most insights gained into the regulation of 
phosphate homeostasis by these factors are derived from human genetic disorders 
and genetically engineered mice, which are reviewed in this paper.
