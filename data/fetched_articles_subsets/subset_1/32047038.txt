The Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) are the largest family of ubiquitin E3s activated 
by neddylation and regulated by the deneddylase COP9 signalosome (CSN). The 
inositol polyphosphate metabolites promote the formation of CRL-CSN complexes, 
but with unclear mechanism of action. Here, we provide structural and genetic 
evidence supporting inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) as a general CSN cofactor 
recruiting CRLs. We determined the crystal structure of IP6 in complex with CSN 
subunit 2 (CSN2), based on which we identified the IP6-corresponding electron 
density in the cryoelectron microscopy map of a CRL4A-CSN complex. IP6 binds to 
a cognate pocket formed by conserved lysine residues from CSN2 and Rbx1/Roc1, 
thereby strengthening CRL-CSN interactions to dislodge the E2 CDC34/UBE2R from 
CRL and to promote CRL deneddylation. IP6 binding-deficient Csn2K70E/K70E 
knockin mice are embryonic lethal. The same mutation disabled 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe Csn2 from rescuing UV-hypersensitivity of csn2-null 
yeast. These data suggest that CRL transition from the E2-bound active state to 
the CSN-bound sequestered state is critically assisted by an interfacial IP6 
small molecule, whose metabolism may be coupled to CRL-CSN complex dynamics.
