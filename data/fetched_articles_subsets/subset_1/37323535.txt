Aging is a prominent risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive 
cognitive decline, memory loss, and neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms, 
accounting for most of the reported dementia cases. This disease is now becoming 
a major challenge and burden on modern society, especially with the aging 
population. Over the last few decades, a significant understanding of the 
pathophysiology of AD has been gained by studying amyloid deposition, 
hyperphosphorylated tau, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, calcium 
dysregulation, and neuroinflammation. This review focuses on the role of 
non-canonical secondary structures of DNA/RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s, G4-DNA, and 
G4-RNA), G4-binding proteins (G4BPs), and helicases, and their roles in aging 
and AD. Being critically important for cellular function, G4s are involved in 
the regulation of DNA and RNA processes, such as replication, transcription, 
translation, RNA localization, and degradation. Recent studies have also 
highlighted G4-DNA's roles in inducing DNA double-strand breaks that cause 
genomic instability and G4-RNA's participation in regulating stress granule 
formation. This review emphasizes the significance of G4s in aging processes and 
how their homeostatic imbalance may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD.
