OBJECTIVE: The mechanism by which mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation 
alleviates atherosclerosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains 
elusive. In this study, we aim to explore the efficacy and mechanism of MSC in 
ameliorating atherosclerosis in SLE.
METHODS: ApoE-/- and Fas-/- mice on the B6 background were cross-bred to 
generate SLE mice with atherosclerosis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
were sorted and quantified. The apoE-/-Fas-/- mice were either treated with 
anti-Gr antibody or injected with MDSCs. The lupus-like autoimmunity and 
atherosclerotic lesions were evaluated. Furthermore, the apoE-/-Fas-/- mice were 
transplanted with MSCs and lupus-like autoimmunity and atherosclerotic lesions 
were assessed.
RESULTS: MDSCs in peripheral blood, spleen, draining lymph nodes increased in 
apoE-/-Fas-/- mice compared with B6 mice. Moreover, the adoptive transfer of 
MDSCs aggravated both atherosclerosis and SLE pathologies, whereas depleting 
MDSCs ameliorated those pathologies in apoE-/-Fas-/- mice. MSC transplantation 
in apoE-/-Fas-/- mice decreased the percentage of MDSCs, alleviated the typical 
atherosclerotic lesions, including atherosclerotic lesions in aortae and liver, 
and reduced serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein levels. 
MSC transplantation also reduced SLE pathologies, including splenomegaly, 
glomerular lesions, anti-dsDNA antibody in serum, urine protein and serum 
creatinine. Moreover, MSC transplantation regulated the generation and function 
of MDSCs through secreting prostaglandin E 2 (PGE2).
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results indicated that the increased MDSCs 
contributed to atherosclerosis in SLE. MSC transplantation ameliorated the 
atherosclerosis and SLE through reducing MDSCs by secreting PGE2.
