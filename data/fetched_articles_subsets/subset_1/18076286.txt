Parkinson disease affects more than 1% of the population over 60 y old. The 
dominant models for Parkinson disease are based on the use of chemical toxins to 
kill dopamine neurons, but do not address the risk factors that normally 
increase with age. Forkhead transcription factors are critical regulators of 
survival and longevity. The forkhead transcription factor, foxa2, is 
specifically expressed in adult dopamine neurons and their precursors in the 
medial floor plate. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments show this gene, 
foxa2, is required to generate dopamine neurons during fetal development and 
from embryonic stem cells. Mice carrying only one copy of the foxa2 gene show 
abnormalities in motor behavior in old age and an associated progressive loss of 
dopamine neurons. Manipulating forkhead function may regulate both the birth of 
dopamine neurons and their spontaneous death, two major goals of regenerative 
medicine.
