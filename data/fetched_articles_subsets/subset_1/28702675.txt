PURPOSE: To date keratoconus (KC) pathogenesis is undefined; however, the 
involvement of inflammatory pathways in disease development is becoming 
apparent. In the present study, we investigated the role of a promoter region 
polymorphism rs1800629 (-308G>A) in the inflammatory pathway component TNF-α and 
its effects on the expression of TNF-α and downstream molecules tumor necrosis 
factor receptor 1 and 2 (TNFR1 and TNFR2), v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis 
viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in KC development.
METHODS: TNF-α promoter polymorphism rs1800629 (-308G>A), was genotyped in 257 
sporadic KC patients and 253 healthy controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was performed to assess for the -308G>A genotypes. Quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was carried out to compare the mRNA expression 
of TNF-α, TNFR1, TNFR2, RELA, and IL6 in the corneal tissues of 20 KC patients 
and 20 donor controls.
RESULTS: The -308G>A genotype GA was found to be significantly associated with 
KC development (dominant model [odds ratio (OR) = 6.67 (95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 4.28-10.42), P < 0.001]) and allele-A (OR = 4.30, 95%CI = 2.93-6.34, P < 
0.001). TNF-α serum levels were significantly raised in patients with GA 
genotype (196.5 ± 69.5 pg/mL) compared to reference genotype GG (21.7 ± 8.2 
pg/mL) (P < 0.0001). There was a significant overexpression of TNF-α (P = 
0.002), TNFR2 (P = 0.0001), RELA (P = 0.0117), and IL6 (P = 0.0007) in the KC 
corneal tissues as compared to the control.
CONCLUSIONS: The GA genotype of the TNF-α -308G>A polymorphism is a significant 
genetic risk factor for the pathogenesis of KC. Moreover, this single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) was observed to be associated with deregulated expression of 
downstream molecules, thus further reinforcing the role of the inflammatory 
pathway components in the development of KC.
