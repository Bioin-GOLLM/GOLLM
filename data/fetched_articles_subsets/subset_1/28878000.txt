Recent advances in single-cell, transcriptomic profiling have provided 
unprecedented access to investigate cell heterogeneity during tissue and organ 
development. In this study, we used massively parallel, single-cell RNA 
sequencing to define cell heterogeneity within the zebrafish kidney marrow, 
constructing a comprehensive molecular atlas of definitive hematopoiesis and 
functionally distinct renal cells found in adult zebrafish. Because our method 
analyzed blood and kidney cells in an unbiased manner, our approach was useful 
in characterizing immune-cell deficiencies within DNA-protein kinase catalytic 
subunit (prkdc), interleukin-2 receptor γ a (il2rga), and 
double-homozygous-mutant fish, identifying blood cell losses in T, B, and 
natural killer cells within specific genetic mutants. Our analysis also 
uncovered novel cell types, including two classes of natural killer immune 
cells, classically defined and erythroid-primed hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells, mucin-secreting kidney cells, and kidney stem/progenitor 
cells. In total, our work provides the first, comprehensive, single-cell, 
transcriptomic analysis of kidney and marrow cells in the adult zebrafish.
