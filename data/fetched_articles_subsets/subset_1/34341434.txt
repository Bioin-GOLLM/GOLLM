The COVID-19 pandemic represents a collective trauma that may have enduring 
stress effects during sensitive periods, such as pregnancy. Prenatal stress may 
result in epigenetic signatures of stress-related genes (e.g., the serotonin 
transporter gene, SLC6A4) that may in turn influence infants' behavioral 
development. In April 2020, we launched a longitudinal cohort study to assess 
the behavioral and epigenetic vestiges of COVID-19-related prenatal stress 
exposure in mothers and infants. COVID-19-related prenatal stress was 
retrospectively assessed at birth. SLC6A4 methylation was assessed in thirteen 
CpG sites in mothers and infants' buccal cells. Infants' temperament was 
assessed at 3-month-age. Complete data were available from 108 mother-infant 
dyads. Greater COVID-19-related prenatal stress was significantly associated 
with higher infants' SLC6A4 methylation in seven CpG sites. SLC6A4 methylation 
at these sites predicted infants' temperament at 3 months.
