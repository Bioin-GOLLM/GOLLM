The proteome represents all the proteins expressed by a genome, a cell, a 
tissue, or an organism at any given time under defined physiological or 
pathological circumstances. Proteomic analysis has provided unparalleled 
opportunities for the discovery of expression patterns of proteins in a 
biological system, yielding precise and inclusive data about the system. 
Advances in the proteomics field opened the door to wider knowledge of the 
mechanisms underlying various post-translational modifications (PTMs) of 
proteins, including glycosylation. As of yet, the role of most of these PTMs 
remains unidentified. In this state-of-the-art review, we present a synopsis of 
glycosylation processes and the pathophysiological conditions that might ensue 
secondary to glycosylation shortcomings. The dynamics of protein glycosylation, 
a crucial mechanism that allows gene and pathway regulation, is described. We 
also explain how-at a biomolecular level-mutations in glycosylation-related 
genes may lead to neuropsychiatric manifestations and neurodegenerative 
disorders. We then analyze the shortcomings of glycoproteomic studies, putting 
into perspective their downfalls and the different advanced enrichment 
techniques that emanated to overcome some of these challenges. Furthermore, we 
summarize studies tackling the association between glycosylation and 
neuropsychiatric disorders and explore glycoproteomic changes in 
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
Huntington disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We 
finally conclude with the role of glycomics in the area of traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) and provide perspectives on the clinical application of 
glycoproteomics as potential diagnostic tools and their application in 
personalized medicine.
