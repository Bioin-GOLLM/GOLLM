Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a key regulator of ovarian function, is 
often used in infertility treatment. Gonadal inhibins suppress FSH synthesis by 
pituitary gonadotrope cells. The TGFβ type III receptor, betaglycan, is required 
for inhibin A suppression of FSH. The inhibin B co-receptor was previously 
unknown. Here, we report that the gonadotrope-restricted transmembrane protein, 
TGFBR3L, is the elusive inhibin B co-receptor. TGFBR3L binds inhibin B but not 
other TGFβ family ligands. TGFBR3L knockdown or overexpression abrogates or 
confers inhibin B activity in cells. Female Tgfbr3l knockout mice exhibit 
increased FSH levels, ovarian follicle development, and litter sizes. In 
contrast, female mice lacking both TGFBR3L and betaglycan are infertile. 
TGFBR3L’s function and cell-specific expression make it an attractive new target 
for the regulation of FSH and fertility.
