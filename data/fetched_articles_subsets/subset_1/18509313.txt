Here, we give a historical overview of the search for genetic variants that 
influence the susceptibility of an individual to a chronic disease, from RA 
Fisher's seminal work to the current excitement of whole-genome association 
studies (WGAS). We then discuss the concepts behind the identification of common 
variants as disease causal factors and contrast them to the basic ideas that 
underlie the rare variant hypothesis. The identification of rare variants 
involves the careful selection of candidate genes to examine, the availability 
of highly efficient resequencing techniques and the appropriate assessment of 
the functional consequences of the implicated variant. We believe that this 
strategy can be successfully applied at present in order to unravel the 
contribution of rare variants to the multifactorial inheritance of common 
diseases, which could lead to the implementation of much needed preventative 
screening schemes.
