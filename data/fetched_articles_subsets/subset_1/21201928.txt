In the title compound, C(34)H(35)N(3)O(2), the polysubstituted piperidine ring 
adopts a chair conformation and the isoxazolidine ring is in an envelope form. 
The mol-ecules are linked into a chain along the b axis by O-H⋯N, C-H⋯O and 
C-H⋯N inter-actions. The chains are cross-linked via weak C-H⋯π inter-actions.
