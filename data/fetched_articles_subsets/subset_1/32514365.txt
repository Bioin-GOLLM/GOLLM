BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in 
postmenopausal women, and inflammation is a key mechanism involved in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) 
has been used as a biomarker of inflammation. Considering that CRP gene rs1205 
polymorphism has been associated with hs-CRP circulating levels, we evaluated 
whether rs1205 genotypes influence the presence of low-grade chronic 
inflammation, acting as a marker of cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study with biobanked blood samples from 
327 postmenopausal women with no evidence of clinical disease. Genotyping for 
rs1205 C > T SNP of the CRP gene was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction 
with allelic discrimination assays.
RESULTS: Mean age was 55.6 ± 5.6 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 
27.3 ± 4.7. Participants were divided according to hs-CRP levels: ≥3 mg/l 
(low-grade chronic inflammation) or < 3 mg/l. The frequency of allele C at 
rs1205 was 74.2% in the hs-CRP ≥ 3 mg/l group vs. 59% in the hs-CRP < 3 mg/l. In 
a multivariable model, higher prevalence of hs-CRP ≥ 3 mg/l was associated with 
CC genotype (PR 1.53; 95%CI 1.07-2.18; p = 0.018) and waist 
circumference ≥ 88 cm (PR 2.45; 95%CI 1.66-3.60; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: CRP rs1205 CC homozygotes may be at higher risk of a low-grade 
chronic inflammatory status compared to individuals carrying the T allele.
