A Rhesus D (RhD) red blood cell phenotype with a weak expression of the D 
antigen occurs in 0.2% to 1% of whites and is called weak D, formerly Du. Red 
blood cells of weak D phenotype have a much reduced number of presumably 
complete D antigens that were repeatedly reported to carry the amino acid 
sequence of the regular RhD protein. The molecular cause of weak D was unknown. 
To evaluate the molecular cause of weak D, we devised a method to sequence all 
10 RHD exons. Among weak D samples, we found a total of 16 different molecular 
weak D types plus two alleles characteristic of partial D. The amino acid 
substitutions of weak D types were located in intracellular and transmembraneous 
protein segments and clustered in four regions of the protein (amino acid 
positions 2 to 13, around 149, 179 to 225, and 267 to 397). Based on sequencing, 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 
polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific priming, none of 161 weak D 
samples investigated showed a normal RHD exon sequence. We concluded, that in 
contrast to the current published dogma most, if not all, weak D phenotypes 
carry altered RhD proteins, suggesting a causal relationship. Our results showed 
means to specifically detect and to classify weak D. The genotyping of weak D 
may guide Rhesus negative transfusion policy for such molecular weak D types 
that were prone to develop anti-D.
