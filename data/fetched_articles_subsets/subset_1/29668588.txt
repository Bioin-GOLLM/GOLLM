RATIONALE: Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a 
rare but potentially lethal inherited arrhythmia syndrome induced by adrenergic 
stress. Due to the atypical clinical manifestations in early age, limited 
recognition and experience of pediatric cardiologists, and low awareness of the 
significance of genetic diagnosis in some underdeveloped areas in China, a 
delayed or missed diagnosis of CPVT in children is common and concerning.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 9-year and 3-month male child with recurrent 
exercise-induced syncope accompanied by convulsion was initially misdiagnosed as 
epilepsy since the first manifestation at the age of 3 years. Due to the 
identification of polymorphic ventricular premature beats, nonsustained 
ventricular tachycardia (VT), and supraventricular tachycardia, a cardiogenic 
etiology was established. The patient received a successive treatment by 
propafenone, amiodarone, a combination of amiodarone with metoprolol, and 
metoprolol alone for up to 6 years.
DIAGNOSES: Given the poor response to conventional antiarrhythmics, 
excise-induced syncope, QRS morphology and a structurally normal heart, the 
diagnosis of CPVT was suspected, and ultimately confirmed by detection of 
polymorphic and bidirectional VT with degeneration into ventricular fibrillation 
during exercise testing. In addition, a heterozygous mutant of RYR2 at 
c.7580T > G was identified by genetic testing.
INTERVENTIONS: Due to the unavailability of flecainide in China and the refusal 
of implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation by his parents, this 
patient continued to be treated with oral metoprolol.
OUTCOMES: Unfortunately, the effect was unfavorable during 4 months outpatient 
follow-up.
LESSONS: CPVT should be suspected in young patients with a normal baseline 
electrocardiogram (EKG), a structurally normal heart and polymorphic and/or 
bidirectional ventricular tachycardia induced by exercise or emotional stress. 
Exercise and genetic testing is essential and significant for a timely and 
accurate diagnosis of CPVT. The current study firstly reported a case with CPVT 
associated with a mutant of RYR2 at c.7580T > G in children.
