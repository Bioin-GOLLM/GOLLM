Whole genome sequencing has enabled the identification of thousands of somatic 
mutations within non-coding genomic regions of individual cancer samples. 
However, identification of mutations that potentially alter gene regulation 
remains a major challenge. Here we present OncoCis, a new method that enables 
identification of potential cis-regulatory mutations using cell type-specific 
genome and epigenome-wide datasets along with matching gene expression data. We 
demonstrate that the use of cell type-specific information and gene expression 
can significantly reduce the number of candidate cis-regulatory mutations 
compared with existing tools designed for the annotation of cis-regulatory SNPs.
