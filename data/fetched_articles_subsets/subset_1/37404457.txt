Current DNA base editors contain nuclease and DNA deaminase that enables 
deamination of cytosine (C) or adenine (A), but no method for guanine (G) or 
thymine (T) editing is available at present. Here we developed a deaminase-free 
glycosylase-based guanine base editor (gGBE) with G editing ability, by fusing 
Cas9 nickase with engineered N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase protein (MPG). By 
several rounds of MPG mutagenesis via unbiased and rational screening using an 
intron-split EGFP reporter, we demonstrated that gGBE with engineered MPG could 
increase G editing efficiency by more than 1500 fold. Furthermore, this gGBE 
exhibited high base editing efficiency (up to 81.2%) and high G-to-T or G-to-C 
(i.e. G-to-Y) conversion ratio (up to 0.95) in both cultured human cells and 
mouse embryos. Thus, we have provided a proof-of-concept of a new base editing 
approach by endowing the engineered DNA glycosylase the capability to 
selectively excise a new type of substrate.
