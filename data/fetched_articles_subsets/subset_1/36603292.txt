BACKGROUND: Treatment with fingolimod for multiple sclerosis (MS) reduces the 
efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this exploratory study was to 
evaluate whether main lymphocyte subsets and demographic features correlated to 
the subsequent increase in anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies following the third dose of 
COVID-19 vaccination in fingolimod-treated MS patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective single-center observational exploratory study 
including a subgroup of adult patients with MS (pwMS) in treatment with 
fingolimod who underwent COVID-19 vaccination. The association of anti-SARS-CoV2 
antibody levels (reported as the Log10 of the difference between the post and 
pre third dose levels) with the total number and percentage of CD3+ T and CD19+ 
B was assessed by a linear regression model adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS: We found that peripheral blood CD19+ B lymphocytes before the third 
dose of vaccination in pwMS treated with fingolimod predict the subsequent 
increase of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies.
CONCLUSION: This work suggests that evaluating the percentage of CD19+ B cells 
may be important to identify patients at risk of not producing SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies, with possible reduced protection from COVID-19.
