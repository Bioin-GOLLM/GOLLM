INTRODUCTION: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an infrequent cause of dementia. 
It is an autosomal recessive disorder with clinical and molecular heterogeneity.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the presence of a possible mutation in a Colombian family 
with several affected siblings and clinical characteristics compatible with 
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis associated to early dementia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied a series of cases with longitudinal follow-up 
and genetic analysis.
RESULTS: These individuals had xanthomas, mental retardation, psychiatric 
disorders, behavioral changes, and multiple domains cognitive impairment with 
dysexecutive dominance that progressed to early dementia. CYP27A1 gene coding 
region sequencing revealed a novel mutation (c.1183_1184insT).
CONCLUSION: The mutation found in this family is responsible for the described 
dementia features. Early identification of familial history with mental 
retardation, xanthomas and cognitive impairment might prevent the progression to 
this treatable type of dementia. Even though this mutation lies in the most 
frequently mutated codon of CYP27A1 gene, it has not been reported previously.
