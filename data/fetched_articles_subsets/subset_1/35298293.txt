PURPOSE: There are limited reports of quality metrics in glioblastoma. We 
audited our adherence to quality indicators as proposed in the PRIME Quality 
Improvement study.
METHODS: This is a retrospective audit of patients treated between 2017 and 
2020. After postsurgical integrated diagnosis, patients received radiotherapy 
(RT) with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ). Multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging at predefined times guided management. Numbers with 
proportions for indices were calculated. Survival was estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: One hundred six patients were consecutively treated. The median age was 
55 years (interquartile range of 47-61 years) with a male preponderance (68%). 
Ninety-six (90.6%) patients underwent subtotal resection, and 10 (9.4%) biopsy 
alone. Isocitrate dehydrogenase was wild-type in 96 (91%), and 
O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase was unmethylated in 70 (66.0%) patients. 
Telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter was mutated in 64 (60.4%), and TP53 
was mutated in 22 (20.8%). Concurrent radiation and TMZ were planned for 104 
(98.1%), and radiation alone for 2 (1.9%). The median time to concurrent RT-TMZ 
was 36 days (interquartile range 30-44 days). All patients planned for RT-TMZ 
completed treatment, but only 81 (76%) completed adjuvant TMZ. Sixty-three (59%) 
completed six cycles, 18 (17%) received less than six cycles, and 25 (24%) did 
not receive adjuvant TMZ. At a median follow-up of 24 months (range 21-31 
months), the median (95% CI) progression-free survival and overall survival were 
11 (95% CI, 9.4 to 13.0) and 20.0 (95% CI, 15 to 26) months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our patients met quality indices in most domains; outcomes are 
comparable with global results. Metrics will be periodically evaluated to 
include new standards and assess continuous service appropriateness.
