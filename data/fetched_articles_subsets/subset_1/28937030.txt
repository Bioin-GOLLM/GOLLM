BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy 
(BMD) are X-linked recessive neuromuscular diseases resulting from dystrophin 
(DMD) gene mutations. It has been known that the carrier of DMD mutations may 
also have symptoms of the disease. While de novo mutation is quite common in 
BMD/DMD patients, it is rarely reported in the female carriers.
METHODS: Two sporadic Chinese patients with progressive muscular dystrophy and 
their familial members were recruited. The targeted next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) and the multiplex ligation-dependent probe analysis (MLPA) were performed 
in the proband. Blood tests, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and 
electromyography were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Two novel mutations of DMD gene were identified, c.7318C>T (p.Q2440*) 
in the male proband and c.4983dupA (p.A1662Sfs*24) in the female carrier. The 
MLPA analysis did not detect any large rearrangements. The haplotype analysis 
indicated that the two mutations were derived from de novo mutagenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel de novo mutations of DMD gene in two 
Chinese pedigrees, one of which caused a female patient with muscular dystrophy. 
The mutational analysis is important for DMD patients and carriers in the 
absence of a family history. The NGS can help detect the mutations in 
MLPA-negative patients.
