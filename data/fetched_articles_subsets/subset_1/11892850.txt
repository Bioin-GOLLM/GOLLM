We have previously found by NMR and CD spectroscopic studies that the helical 
content of the sodium channel inactivation gate-related peptide 
(Ac-GGQDIFMTEEQK-NH2; MP-1A) in 80% trifluoroethanol solutions was increased by 
adding a pentapeptide, KIFMK. In order to study in further detail whether the 
presence of the IFM motif and the two lysine residues is a prerequisite for 
stabilizing the helical conformation, we examined interactions between various 
oligopeptides (RIFMR, KIFMTK, KIQMK, KAFAK, KIIIK) and MP-1A and its related 
peptides; that is, MP-2A in which Phe was replaced by Gln, MP-1MMA in which Thr 
was replaced by Met, MP-1TA in which Thr was removed from MP-1A, and MP-1A' in 
which L-Phe was replaced by D-Phe. It was found that the IFM motif was 
absolutely necessary in both the oligopeptide and the inactivation gate peptide. 
This finding means that hydrophobic interactions are operative between KIFMK and 
MP-1A. In contrast, KIFMK destabilized the helical structure of MP-1MMA, MP-1TA, 
and MP-1A', showing that the conformation around the IFM motif in the 
inactivation gate peptides is an important factor. It was concluded that the IFM 
motif and the two Lys residues are a prerequisite for effectively stabilizing 
the alpha-helix of MP-1A.
