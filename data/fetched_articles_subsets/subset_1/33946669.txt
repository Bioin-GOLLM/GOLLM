The unfolded protein response is the mechanism by which cells control 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein homeostasis. Under normal conditions, the UPR 
is not activated; however, under certain stresses, such as hypoxia or altered 
glycosylation, the UPR can be activated due to an accumulation of unfolded 
proteins. The activation of the UPR involves three signaling pathways, IRE1, 
PERK and ATF6, which all play vital roles in returning protein homeostasis to 
levels seen in non-stressed cells. IRE1 is the best studied of the three 
pathways, as it is the only pathway present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This 
pathway involves spliceosome independent splicing of HAC1 or XBP1 in yeast and 
mammalians cells, respectively. PERK limits protein synthesis, therefore 
reducing the number of new proteins requiring folding. ATF6 is translocated and 
proteolytically cleaved, releasing a NH2 domain fragment which is transported to 
the nucleus and which affects gene expression. If the UPR is unsuccessful at 
reducing the load of unfolded proteins in the ER and the UPR signals remain 
activated, this can lead to programmed cell death.
