AIM: To investigate the presence of lysyl oxidase (LOX) G473A polymorphism in 
group 1 {Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) patients}, group 2 (betel quid chewers 
without OSMF) and group 3 (healthy individuals).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 60 patients were taken for the study, which 
included 20 OSMF patients (group 1), 20 betel quid chewers without OSMF (group 
2) and 20 healthy individuals without OSMF and betel quid chewing habit (group 
3). DNA was isolated using Qiagen kit. The isolated DNA was quantified using 
spectroscopic methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out at 
annealing temperature of 67(o) C. PCR amplification was checked on 2% agarose 
gel. Further, the amplified PCR products were subjected to automated DNA 
sequencer, to assess LOX G473A polymorphism.
RESULTS: The gene sequence data generated from the automated DNA sequencer was 
received as colored electropherograms. These gene-sequencing results did not 
show LOX G473A polymorphism in any of the 3 groups.
CONCLUSION: In our study, gene-sequencing results did not show LOX G473A 
polymorphism in OSMF patients. Since only one study in the literature has shown 
the association of LOX gene polymorphism and OSMF patients, we conclude that 
further studies are required to unveil the role of LOX gene polymorphism in 
OSMF.
