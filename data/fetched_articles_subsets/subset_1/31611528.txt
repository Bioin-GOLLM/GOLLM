Patients with chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 (CEAS) develop 
multiple circular, longitudinal, or eccentric ulcers in the ileum. It is 
sometimes difficult to distinguish CEAS from Crohn's disease. CEAS and primary 
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO) are together known to be caused by a 
mutation of SLCO2A1 gene. The case of a 65-year-old man whose characteristic 
appearance due to pachydermia of the forehead folds led to the diagnosis of CEAS 
with PHO is presented.
