Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 
that affects selected cortical and spinal neuronal populations, leading to 
progressive paralysis and death. A growing body of evidences suggests that the 
disease may originate in the cerebral cortex and propagate in a corticofugal 
manner. In particular, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed that 
ALS patients present with early cortical hyperexcitability arising from a 
combination of increased excitability and decreased inhibition. Here, we discuss 
the possibility that initial cortical circuit dysfunction might act as the main 
driver of ALS onset and progression, and review recent functional, imaging and 
transcriptomic studies conducted on ALS patients, along with 
electrophysiological, pathological and transcriptomic studies on animal and 
cellular models of the disease, in order to evaluate the potential cellular and 
molecular origins of cortical hyperexcitability in ALS.
