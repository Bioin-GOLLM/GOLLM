Human coronaviruses present a substantial global disease burden, causing damage 
to populations' health, economy, and social well-being. Glycans are one of the 
main structural components of all microbes and organismic structures, including 
viruses-playing multiple essential roles in virus infection and immunity. 
Studying and understanding virus glycans at the nanoscale provide new insights 
into the diagnosis and treatment of viruses. Glycan nanostructures are 
considered potential targets for molecular diagnosis, antiviral therapeutics, 
and the development of vaccines. This review article describes glycan 
nanostructures (eg, glycoproteins and glycolipids) that exist in cells, 
subcellular structures, and microbes. We detail the structure, characterization, 
synthesis, and functions of virus glycans. Furthermore, we describe the glycan 
nanostructures of different human coronaviruses, such as human coronavirus 229E 
(HCoV-229E), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), 
human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), the Middle East respiratory 
syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and how glycan nanotechnology can be 
useful to prevent and combat human coronaviruses infections, along with 
possibilities that are not yet explored.
