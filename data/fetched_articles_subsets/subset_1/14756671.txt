DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
(PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
and to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. 
The clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. 
All of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and 
a good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report 
describing the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the 
TATA-binding protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical 
PD.
