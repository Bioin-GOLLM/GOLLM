Myxobacteria generate natural products with unique chemical structures, which 
not only feature remarkable biological functions, but also demonstrate 
unprecedented biosynthetic assembly strategies. The stigmatellins have been 
previously described as potent inhibitors of the mitochondrial and 
photosynthetic respiratory chain and originate from an unusual polyketide 
synthase assembly line. While previous biosynthetic investigations were focused 
on the formation of the 5,7-dimethoxy-8-hydroxychromone ring, side chain 
decoration of the hydrophobic alkenyl chain in position 2 was investigated less 
thoroughly. We report here the full structure elucidation, as well as cytotoxic 
and antimicrobial activities of three new stigmatellins isolated from the 
myxobacterium Vitiosangium cumulatum MCy10943T with side chain decorations 
distinct from previously characterized members of this compound family. The 
hydrophobic alkenyl chain in position 2 of the herein described stigmatellins 
feature a terminal carboxylic acid group (1), a methoxy group at C-12' (2) or a 
vicinal diol (3). These findings provide further implications considering the 
side chain decoration of these aromatic myxobacterial polyketides and their 
underlying biosynthesis.
