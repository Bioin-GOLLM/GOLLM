BACKGROUND: Trisomy 19q is a recognizable syndrome and associated with a wide 
spectrum of clinical phenotypes in clinic. The purpose of this study was to 
explore the prenatal phenotypes of 19q13.42 duplication, which was rarely 
reported in clinic.
CASE PRESENTATION: Three pregnant women presenting diverse indications for 
prenatal diagnosis accepted amniocentesis: increased nuchal translucency and 
fetal pyelic separation (case 2) and high risk of maternal serum screening for 
Down syndrome (case 1 and case 3). Case 1 and case 2 shared similar duplicated 
locus in the region of 19q13.42, encompassing part NLRP12 gene. The latter 
inherited the chromosomal duplication from the mother with normal phenotypes. 
Case 3 carried a 1.445Â Mb duplication in the 19q13.42q13.43 region. It was 
proposed that evolutionary duplication of NLRP12 gene could have a causative 
role in autoinflammatory diseases development. The genotype-phenotype 
correlation depends mainly on the duplicated size and functional genes involved, 
which is still yet to be determined. All pregnant women chose to continue the 
pregnancy and delivered healthy children with no apparent abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The 19q13.42 microduplications in our study were the smallest 
fragments compared to previous literature. Our findings enriched the prenatal 
phenotypes for this chromosomal microscopic imbalance. It was proposed that long 
term follow up analysis should be guaranteed till adulthood to determine whether 
there will be other emerging clinical symptoms and developmental-behavioral 
disorders for such carriers.
