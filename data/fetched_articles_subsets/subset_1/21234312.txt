Aim. In this study we presented our experience of 18 years on the etiology, risk 
factors, prophylactic and acute treatment, the effect of treatment to recurrence 
rate of patients with stroke. Methods. The population included 108 patients who 
had been treated for stroke at Pediatric Neurology Department of Ankara 
University with the diagnosis of arterial ischemic stroke and sinovenous 
thrombosis between January 1992 and August 2010. Forty-one girls (38%) and 67 
boys (62%) with mean symptom age 3.1 ± 4.04 years, (0-18 years old) were 
followed up with a mean period of 4.9 ± 3.78 years (0-17 years). Results. 30 
patients had no risk factors, 34 patients had only one risk factor and 44 
patients had multiple risk factors. Recurrence was seen in three patients. There 
was no any statistical correlation between the recurrence of stroke and the 
existence of risk factors (P = .961). Seventeen patients received prophylactic 
treatment; 2 of them without any risk factors, 3 had one risk factor, 12 
patients, who constituted the majority of our patients, had multiple risk 
factors (P = .024). Conclusion. With this study we showed that the right 
prophylaxis for right patients reduces the rate of recurrence.
