OBJECTIVE: As genetic variation accounts for two-thirds of the variation in 
external apical root resorption (EARR) concurrent with orthodontic treatment, we 
analyzed the association of selected genetic and treatment-related factors with 
EARR concurrent with orthodontic treatment.
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: This case-control study of 134 unrelated, 
orthodontically treated Caucasian individuals was conducted in part at an 
Indiana Private Practice, Indiana University and the University of Kentucky.
METHODS: Utilizing a research data bank containing information from ~1450 
orthodontically treated patients, pre- and post-treatment radiographs from 460 
individuals were evaluated for EARR of the four permanent maxillary incisors. 
Sixty-seven unrelated Caucasians with moderate to severe EARR were identified 
and were age-/sex-matched with orthodontically treated Caucasian controls 
yielding 38 females and 29 males per group. Factors tested for an association 
with EARR included the following: 1) treatment duration, 2) extraction of 
maxillary premolars, 3) numerous cephalometric measurements, and 4) DNA 
polymorphisms within/near candidate genes in a pathway previously implicated in 
EARR such as the purinergic-receptor-P2X, ligand-gated ion channel 7 (P2RX7; 
rs208294, rs1718119, and rs2230912), caspase-1 (CASP1; rs530537, rs580253, and 
rs554344), interleukin-1 beta (IL1B; rs1143634), interleukin-1 alpha (IL1A; 
rs1800587), and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA; rs419598) genes. 
Stepwise logistic regression was utilized to identify the factors significantly 
associated (significance taken at or less than the layered Bonferroni correction 
alpha) with the occurrence of EARR.
RESULTS: A long length of treatment and the presence of specific genotypes for 
P2RX7 SNP rs208294 were significantly associated with EARR.
CONCLUSION: EARR occurrence was associated with both genetic and 
treatment-related variables, which together explained 25% of the total variation 
associated with EARR in the sample tested.
