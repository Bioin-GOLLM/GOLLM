PURPOSE: Despite the revealed role of immunological dysfunctions in the 
development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through animal and 
postmortem investigations, direct evidence regarding the impact of genetic 
factors on microglia response and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in AD individuals is 
lacking. This study aims to elucidate this mechanism by integrating 
transcriptomics and TSPO, Aβ PET imaging in clinical AD cohort.
METHODS: We analyzed 85 patients with PET/MR imaging for microglial activation 
(TSPO, [18F]DPA-714) and Aβ ([18F]AV-45) within the prospective Alzheimer's 
Disease Immunization and Microbiota Initiative Study Cohort (ADIMIC). 
Immune-related differentially expressed genes (IREDGs), identified based on 
AlzData, were screened and verified using blood samples from ADIMIC. Correlation 
and mediation analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between 
immune-related genes expression, TSPO and Aβ PET imaging.
RESULTS: TSPO uptake increased significantly both in aMCI (P < 0.05) and AD 
participants (P < 0.01) and showed a positive correlation with Aβ deposition 
(r = 0.42, P < 0.001). Decreased expression of TGFBR3, FABP3, CXCR4 and CD200 
was observed in AD group. CD200 expression was significantly negatively 
associated with TSPO PET uptake (r =-0.33, P = 0.013). Mediation analysis 
indicated that CD200 acted as a significant mediator between TSPO uptake and Aβ 
deposition (total effect B = 1.92, P = 0.004) and MMSE score (total effect 
B =-54.01, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: By integrating transcriptomics and TSPO PET imaging in the same 
clinical AD cohort, this study revealed CD200 played an important role in 
regulating neuroinflammation, Aβ deposition and cognitive dysfunction.
