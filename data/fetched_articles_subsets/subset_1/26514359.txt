Central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CNS-HBs) occur sporadically or as a 
component of von Hippel-Lindau-VHL syndrome. CNS-HBs share some molecular 
similarities with pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PPGLs) and renal cell 
carcinomas (RCCs). Recently, hypoxia-inducible factors, particularly somatic 
HIF2A mutations, have been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis 
of PPGLs. Somatic mutations in HIF2A have been reported in PPGLs associated with 
polycythemia, which have been reported to also be present in patients with RCCs 
and HBs. However, whether CNS-HBs is associated with the presence of a HIF2A 
mutation is currently uknown. We analyzed somatic HIF2A and VHL mutations in a 
series of 28 sporadic CNS-HBs. We also investigated the expression of HIF target 
proteins and hypoxia-associated factor (HAF). Two sporadic CNS-HBs were found to 
have somatic HIF2A mutations. One tumor had 2 HIF2A missense mutations, one of 
which was previously described in a PPGL (c.1121 T>A, F374Y). The second patient 
had coexistence of somatic truncated mutations (c.1669 C>T, Q557*) in HIF2A 
together with a VHL mutation. Neither of the two patients had polycythemia at 
the time of diagnosis. We demonstrate that the novel truncated mutation in HIF2A 
(Q557*) affects HIF-2α prolyl hydroxylation with its reduced ubiquitination but 
intact transcriptional activity, resulting in an activating effect. Both CNS-HB 
samples showed positive expression of VEGFR2/CA9/Glut1 and HAF. Our data support 
the unique central role of the VHL/HIF-2α signaling pathway in the molecular 
pathogenesis of CNS-HBs and show for the first time the presence of HIF2A 
mutations in sporadic HB.
