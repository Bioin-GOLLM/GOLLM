Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder 
worldwide. Many factors have been shown to contribute to its pathogenesis 
including genetic and environmental factors. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 
(UCHL1) is also known to be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. We herein 
modeled the study of UCHL1 in Drosophila melanogaster and investigated its 
functions in PD. The specific knockdown of the Drosophila ortholog of UCHL1 
(dUCH) in dopaminergic neurons (DA neurons) led to the underdevelopment and/or 
degeneration of these neurons, specifically in DL1 DA neuron cluster in the 
larval brain lobe and PPM2, PPM3, PPL2ab, and VUM DA neuron clusters in the 
adult brain. These defects were followed by a shortage of dopamine in the brain, 
which subsequently resulted in locomotor dysfunction. The degeneration of DA 
neurons in dUCH knockdown adult brain, which occurred progressively and severely 
during the course of aging, mimics the epidemiology of PD. DA neuron and 
locomotor defects were rescued when dUCH knockdown flies were treated with 
vitamin C, a well-known antioxidant. These results suggest that dUCH knockdown 
fly is a promising model for studying the pathogenesis and epidemiology of PD as 
well as the screening of potential antioxidants for PD therapeutics.
