Several models of activation mechanisms were proposed for G protein-coupled 
receptors (GPCRs), yet no direct methods exist for their elucidation. The 
availability of constitutively active mutants has given an opportunity to study 
active receptor conformations within acceptable limits using models such as the 
angiotensin II type 1 (AT1)1 receptor mutant N111G-hAT1 which displays an 
important constitutive activity. Recently, by using methionine proximity assay, 
we showed for the hAT1 receptor that TMD III, VI, and VII form the 
ligand-binding pocket of the C-terminal amino acid of an antagonistic AngII 
analogue. In the present contribution, we investigated whether the same residues 
would also constitute the ligand-binding contacts in constitutively activated 
mutant (CAM) receptors. For this purpose, the same Met mutagenesis strategy was 
carried out on the N111G double mutants. Analysis of 43 receptors mutants in the 
N111G-hAT1 series, photolabeled and CNBr digested, showed that there were only 
subtle structural changes between the wt-receptor and its constitutively active 
form.
