An Azorean family with Hb H disease (10% Hb H) was studied in order to elucidate 
its molecular basis. DNA studies on the patient only revealed a 4.2 kb 
"leftward" deletion of paternal origin which implies the co-inheritance of a 
nondeletional alpha-thalassemia determinant. Restriction endonuclease and 
oligonucleotide analysis allowed the exclusion of five point mutations: 
initiation codon (at both alpha 1- and alpha 2-globin genes), IVS-I donor splice 
junction pentanucleotide deletion, codon 125 CTG----CCG substitution, and Saudi 
Arabian polyadenylation signal mutation. These findings suggest that the 
molecular basis of this form of Hb H disease is probably different from those 
described previously.
