Cancer-associated inflammation is a molecular key feature in pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma. Oncogenic KRAS in conjunction with persistent inflammation is 
known to accelerate carcinogenesis, although the underlying mechanisms remain 
poorly understood. Here, we outline a novel pathway whereby the transcription 
factors NFATc1 and STAT3 cooperate in pancreatic epithelial cells to promote 
Kras(G12D)-driven carcinogenesis. NFATc1 activation is induced by inflammation 
and itself accelerates inflammation-induced carcinogenesis in Kras(G12D) mice, 
whereas genetic or pharmacologic ablation of NFATc1 attenuates this effect. 
Mechanistically, NFATc1 complexes with STAT3 for enhancer-promoter 
communications at jointly regulated genes involved in oncogenesis, for example, 
Cyclin, EGFR and WNT family members. The NFATc1-STAT3 cooperativity is operative 
in pancreatitis-mediated carcinogenesis as well as in established human 
pancreatic cancer. Together, these studies unravel new mechanisms of 
inflammatory-driven pancreatic carcinogenesis and suggest beneficial effects of 
chemopreventive strategies using drugs that are currently available for 
targeting these factors in clinical trials.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our study points to the existence of an oncogenic NFATc1-STAT3 
cooperativity that mechanistically links inflammation with pancreatic cancer 
initiation and progression. Because NFATc1-STAT3 nucleoprotein complexes control 
the expression of gene networks at the intersection of inflammation and cancer, 
our study has significant relevance for potentially managing pancreatic cancer 
and other inflammatory-driven malignancies.
