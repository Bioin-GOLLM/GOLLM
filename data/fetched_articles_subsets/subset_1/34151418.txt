BACKGROUND: Incidence rates of pediatric cancers in the United States are 
typically reported in 5-year age groups, obscuring variation by single year of 
age. Additionally, racial and ethnic variation in incidence is typically 
presented in broad categories rather than by narrow age ranges.
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 data 
(2000-2017) were examined to calculate frequencies and age-adjusted incidence 
rates among individuals aged birth to 39 years. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated as the measure of association 
for rate comparisons by race and Hispanic origin overall and by single year of 
age.
RESULTS: Several histologic types showed substantial variation in 
race/ethnicity-specific and overall rates by single year of age. Overall, Black 
children and young adults experienced substantially decreased incidence of acute 
lymphoid leukemia (IRR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.49-0.55) compared to Whites, and this 
decreased incidence was strongest at ages 1 through 7 years and 16 through 20 
years. Hispanic individuals experienced decreased overall incidence of Hodgkin 
lymphoma (IRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.48-0.52) and astrocytoma (IRR, 0.54; 95% CI, 
0.52-0.56) and increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (IRR, 1.46; 95% 
CI, 1.42-1.51) compared to non-Hispanic Whites, and the increased risk was 
strongest at ages 10 through 23 years. Substantial decreased risk across many 
tumor types was also observed for Asian/Pacific Islanders and American 
Indian/Alaska Natives.
CONCLUSIONS: Examination of incidence rates for pediatric cancers by narrow age 
groups may provide insights regarding etiological differences in subgroups. 
Additionally, variation in age-specific incidence rates by race and ethnicity 
may enable hypothesis generation on drivers of disparities observed.
