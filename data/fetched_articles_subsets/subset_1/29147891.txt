Preeclamptic women are reported to have inadequate plasma volume expansion 
coupled with a suppressed secretion of aldosterone; however, the specific 
mechanism of preeclampsia remains unclear. We demonstrated that the presence of 
long-term angiotensin II type 1 receptor autoantibody (AT1-AA) reduces 
aldosterone production by triggering a Ca2+ overload in H295R cells. AT1-AA was 
discovered in preeclamptic women and reported to activate AT1R, and consequently 
elevate intracellular Ca2+. We found that AT1-AA significantly prolonged the 
time of intracellular Ca2+ elevation. Besides promoting aldosterone production 
as a second messenger, Ca2+ overload shows a cytotoxic effect. Our data reveals 
that long-term presence of AT1-AA triggered a Ca2+ overload and consequent 
impairment of aldosterone production, which could be prevented by a PKC 
inhibitor, GÃ¶ 6983, or a calcium channel inhibitor, nifedipine. These findings 
have clinical significance because AT1R blockers are not recommended for 
treatment of preeclampsia due to their potential harm to the fetus. Our findings 
also emphasize a potential clinical benefit of immunoadsorption or 
neutralization of AT1-AA in preeclamptic women.
