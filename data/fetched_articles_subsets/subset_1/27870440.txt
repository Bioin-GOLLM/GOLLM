Despite consistent observations of sex differences in depression and related 
emotional disorders, we do not yet know how these sex differences modulate the 
effects of genetic polymorphisms implicated in risk for these disorders. This 
Mini-Review focuses on genetic polymorphisms of the serotonergic system to 
illustrate how sex differences might modulate the neurobiological pathways 
involved in the development of depression. We consider the interacting role of 
environmental factors such as early-life stress. Given limited current knowledge 
about this topic, we highlight methodological considerations, challenges, and 
guidelines for future research. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
