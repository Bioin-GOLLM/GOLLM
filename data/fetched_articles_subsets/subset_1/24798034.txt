The synthetic challenges in glycobiology and glycochemistry hamper the 
development of glycobiomaterials for biomedicine. Here we report the use of 
molecular self-assembly to sidestep the laborious synthesis of complex glycans 
for promoting the proliferation of murine embryonic stem (mES) cells. Our study 
shows that the supramolecular assemblies of a small molecule conjugate of 
nucleobase, amino acids, and saccharide, as a de novo glycoconjugate, promote 
the proliferation of mES cells and the development of zygotes into blastocysts 
of mouse. Molecular engineering confirms that each motif (i.e., adenine, 
Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) domain, and glucosamine) is indispensable for the observed 
activity of the conjugate. As the first example of using assemblies of the 
molecular conjugates of multiple fundamental biological building blocks to 
control cell behaviors, this work illustrates an unprecedented approach to use 
supramolecular assemblies as multifunctional mimics of glycoconjugates.
