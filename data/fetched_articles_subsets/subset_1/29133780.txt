SIRT1 is the most evolutionarily conserved mammalian sirtuin, and it plays a 
vital role in the regulation of metabolism, stress responses, genome stability, 
and ageing. As a stress sensor, SIRT1 deacetylase activity is significantly 
increased during stresses, but the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully clear. 
Here, we show that SIRT1 is dynamically modified with O-GlcNAc at Ser 549 in its 
carboxy-terminal region, which directly increases its deacetylase activity both 
in vitro and in vivo. The O-GlcNAcylation of SIRT1 is elevated during genotoxic, 
oxidative, and metabolic stress stimuli in cellular and mouse models, thereby 
increasing SIRT1 deacetylase activity and protecting cells from stress-induced 
apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism for the activation of SIRT1 
under stress conditions and suggest a novel potential therapeutic target for 
preventing age-related diseases and extending healthspan.
