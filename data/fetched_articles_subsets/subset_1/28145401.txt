L-plastin is a calcium-regulated actin-bundling protein that is expressed in 
cells of hematopoietic origin and in most metastatic cancer cells. These cell 
types are mobile and require the constant remodeling of their actin 
cytoskeleton, where L-plastin bundles filamentous actin. The calcium-dependent 
regulation of the actin-bundling activity of L-plastin is not well understood. 
We have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of the EF-hand 
calcium-sensor headpiece domain. Unexpectedly, this domain does not bind 
directly to the four CH-domains of L-plastin. A novel switch helix is present 
immediately after the calcium-binding region and it binds tightly to the EF-hand 
motifs in the presence of calcium. We demonstrate that this switch helix plays a 
major role during actin-bundling. Moreover a peptide that competitively inhibits 
the association between the EF-hand motifs and the switch helix was shown to 
deregulate the actin-bundling activity of L-plastin. Overall, these findings may 
help to develop new drugs that target the L-plastin headpiece and interfere in 
the metastatic activity of cancer cells.
