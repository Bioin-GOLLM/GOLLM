Signaling through the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) on the osteoblast 
influences bone remodeling in rodents. In the B2AR gene, three polymorphisms 
influence receptor function. We show that these polymorphisms are not associated 
with fracture risk or bone mineral density in the UCP, Rotterdam Study, and 
GEFOS cohorts.
INTRODUCTION: Signaling through the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) on the 
osteoblast influences bone remodeling in rodents. In the B2AR gene, three 
polymorphisms are known to influence receptor function in vitro and in vivo 
(rs1042713, rs1042714, and rs1800888). We examined the role of these 
polymorphisms in the B2AR gene on human bone metabolism.
METHODS: We performed nested case-control studies to determine the association 
of these polymorphisms with fracture risk in the Utrecht Cardiovascular 
Pharmacogenetics (UCP) cohort and in three cohorts of the Rotterdam Study. We 
also determined the association of these polymorphisms with bone mineral density 
(BMD) in the GEFOS Consortium. UCP contains drug-dispensing histories from 
community pharmacies linked to national registrations of hospital discharges in 
the Netherlands. The Rotterdam Study is a prospective cohort study investigating 
demographics and risk factors of chronic diseases. GEFOS is a large 
international collaboration studying the genetics of osteoporosis. Fractures 
were defined by ICD-9 codes 800-829 in the UCP cohort (158 cases and 2617 
unmatched controls) and by regular X-ray examinations, general practitioner, and 
hospital records in the Rotterdam Study (2209 cases and 8559 unmatched 
controls). BMD was measured at the femoral neck and lumbar spine using 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in GEFOS (N = 32,961).
RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the two nested case-control studies showed pooled odds 
ratios of 0.98 (0.91-1.05, p = 0.52), 1.04 (0.97-1.12, p = 0.28), and 1.16 
(0.83-1.62, p = 0.38) for the associations between rs1042713, rs1042714, and 
rs1800888 per minor allele and fractures, respectively. There were no 
significant associations of the polymorphisms and BMD in GEFOS.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, polymorphisms in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene 
are not associated with fracture risk or BMD.
