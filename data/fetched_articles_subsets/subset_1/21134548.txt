BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of fine needle aspiration biopsies of the thyroid 
have inconclusive results. We conducted a prospective trial to determine whether 
clinical and molecular markers could be used in combination to improve the 
accuracy of thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy.
METHODS: Clinical, tumor genotyping for common somatic mutations (BRAF V600E, 
NRAS, KRAS, RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3, and NTRK1), and the gene expression levels of 6 
candidate diagnostic markers were analyzed by univariate and multivariate 
methods in 341 patients to determine whether they could distinguish reliably 
benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms, and a scoring model was derived.
RESULTS: By a multivariate analysis, fine needle aspiration biopsy cytology 
classification, the presence of a NRAS mutation, and the tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase 1 expression level were associated jointly with malignancy. 
The overall accuracy of the scoring model, including these 3 variables, to 
distinguish benign from malignant thyroid tumors was 91%, including 67% for the 
indeterminate and 77% for the suspicious FNA subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Fine needle aspiration biopsy cytology classification, the presence 
of NRAS mutation, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 messenger RNA 
expression levels in combination provide a greater diagnostic accuracy than fine 
needle aspiration biopsy cytology alone to allow selection of more definitive 
initial operative treatment. The sensitivity of the scoring model, however, was 
too low to avoid the need for diagnostic thyroidectomies for indeterminate fine 
needle aspiration biopsy findings.
