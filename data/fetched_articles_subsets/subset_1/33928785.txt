BACKGROUND: Phospholamban (PLN) is a critical regulator of calcium cycling and 
contractility in the heart. The loss of arginine at position 14 in PLN (R14del) 
is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy with a high prevalence of ventricular 
arrhythmias. How the R14 deletion causes dilated cardiomyopathy is poorly 
understood, and there are no disease-specific therapies.
METHODS: We used single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover PLN R14del disease 
mechanisms in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). We used both 
2-dimensional and 3-dimensional functional contractility assays to evaluate the 
impact of modulating disease-relevant pathways in PLN R14del hiPSC-CMs.
RESULTS: Modeling of the PLN R14del cardiomyopathy with isogenic pairs of 
hiPSC-CMs recapitulated the contractile deficit associated with the disease in 
vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the induction of the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) pathway in PLN R14del compared with isogenic control hiPSC-CMs. 
The activation of UPR was also evident in the hearts from PLN R14del patients. 
Silencing of each of the 3 main UPR signaling branches (IRE1, ATF6, or PERK) by 
siRNA exacerbated the contractile dysfunction of PLN R14del hiPSC-CMs. We 
explored the therapeutic potential of activating the UPR with a small molecule 
activator, BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein) inducer X. PLN R14del hiPSC-CMs 
treated with BiP protein inducer X showed a dose-dependent amelioration of the 
contractility deficit in both 2-dimensional cultures and 3-dimensional 
engineered heart tissues without affecting calcium homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that the UPR exerts a protective 
effect in the setting of PLN R14del cardiomyopathy and that modulation of the 
UPR might be exploited therapeutically.
