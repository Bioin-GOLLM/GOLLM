BACKGROUND: Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a rare autosomal recessive 
disease caused by a mutation in the AGXT gene, resulting in deficiency of the 
alanineglyoxylate:aminotransferase enzyme. It is characterized by accumulation 
of oxalate in the kidneys and other organs.
CASE PRESENTATION: A Syrian woman with a history of nephrolithiasis and 
heterozygosity for factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations presented with 
postpartum renal failure. She required initiation of renal replacement therapy 
at 14 weeks postpartum. Kidney biopsy showed severe acute and chronic 
crystalline deposition consistent with oxalate nephropathy. Genetic testing 
revealed a Gly170Arg mutation in the AGXT gene, confirming the diagnosis of PH1.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of PH should be considered in patients with severe, 
recurrent calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Early treatment with pyridoxine 
reduces urinary oxalate excretion and can delay progression to end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). After ESRD, intensive dialysis is needed to prevent systemic 
oxalate accumulation and deposition. Combined liver and kidney transplantation 
is curative. In our patient, we anticipate that liver transplantation will cure 
both the hyperoxaluria and the hypercoagulable state.
