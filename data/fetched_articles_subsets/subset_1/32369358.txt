Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma is an aggressive pediatric cancer for which no 
effective chemotherapeutic drugs exist. Analysis of the genomic landscape of 
this disease has led to the identification of the serine/threonine kinase ALK2 
as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. In this work, we adopted an 
open science approach to develop a series of potent type I inhibitors of ALK2 
which are orally bio-available and brain-penetrant. Initial efforts resulted in 
the discovery of M4K2009, an analogue of the previously reported ALK2 inhibitor 
LDN-214117. Although highly selective for ALK2 over the TGF-βR1 receptor ALK5, 
M4K2009 is also moderately active against the hERG potassium channel. Varying 
the substituents of the trimethoxyphenyl moiety gave rise to an equipotent 
benzamide analogue M4K2149 with reduced off-target affinity for the ion channel. 
Additional modifications yielded 2-fluoro-6-methoxybenzamide derivatives 
(26a-c), which possess high inhibitory activity against ALK2, excellent 
selectivity, and superior pharmacokinetic profiles.
