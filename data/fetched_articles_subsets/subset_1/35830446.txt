OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the relationship between genotypes and 
clinical phenotypes of Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) to support 
risk estimation and therapeutic decisions.
DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES: The data of our study were collected from PubMed, Embase, Web of 
Science, Cochrane, CBM, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WAN FANG 
and VIP databases since inception to August 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 3257 patients from 32 studies were included according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among all the cases, the mutation frequencies 
of LRP5, FZD4, NDP, TSPAN12, ZNF408 and KIF11 were 13.6%, 11.5%, 4.6%, 6.7%, 
1.6%, and 5.7%, respectively. We found that the patients with NDP and FZD4 
suffer more severe symptoms, among which 86.4% patients of NDP and 78.6% 
patients of FZD4 were in the advanced stage of FEVR. Retinal detachment is the 
most frequent symptom with patients of LRP5 and NDP mutations, accounting for 
51.9% and 64.5%, respectively. For the patients with the mutation of TSPAN12, 
retinal fold is the most common clinical manifestation, and suffer the mildest 
clinical phenotypes compared with the other three genes.
CONCLUSION: The results of the meta-analysis indicate that different types of 
genetic mutations occur at different frequencies. In addition, the clinical 
manifestations of FEVR are related to the type of gene mutation. Therefore, 
targeted treatment strategies and follow-up recommendations should be adopted 
for different pathogenic genes of FEVR.
