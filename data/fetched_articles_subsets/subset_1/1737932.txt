L and H chain cDNAs of M195, a murine mAb that binds to the CD33 Ag on normal 
and leukemic myeloid cells, were cloned. The cDNAs were used in the construction 
of mouse/human IgG1 and IgG3 chimeric antibodies. In addition, humanized 
antibodies were constructed which combined the complementarity-determining 
regions of the M195 antibody with human framework and constant regions. The 
human framework was chosen to maximize homology with the M195 V domain sequence. 
Moreover, a computer model of M195 was used to identify several framework amino 
acids that are likely to interact with the complementarity-determining regions, 
and these residues were also retained in the humanized antibodies. Unexpectedly, 
the humanized IgG1 and IgG3 M195 antibodies, which have reshaped V regions, have 
higher apparent binding affinity for the CD33 Ag than the chimeric or mouse 
antibodies.
