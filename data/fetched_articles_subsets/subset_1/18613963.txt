BACKGROUND: The emergence of high pathogenicity strains of Influenza A virus in 
a variety of human and animal hosts, with wide geographic distribution, has 
highlighted the importance of rapid identification and subtyping of the virus 
for outbreak management and treatment. Type A virus can be classified into 
subtypes according to the viral envelope glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and 
neuraminidase. Here we review the existing specificity and amplification of 
published primers to subtype neuraminidase genes and describe a new broad 
spectrum primer pair that can detect all 9 neuraminidase subtypes.
RESULTS: Bioinformatic analysis of 3,337 full-length influenza A neuraminidase 
segments in the NCBI database revealed semi-conserved regions not previously 
targeted by primers. Two degenerate primers with M13 tags, NA8F-M13 and 
NA10R-M13 were designed from these regions and used to generate a 253 bp cDNA 
product. One-step RT-PCR testing was successful in 31/32 (97%) cases using a 
touchdown protocol with RNA from over 32 different cultured influenza A virus 
strains representing the 9 neuraminidase subtypes. Frozen blinded clinical 
nasopharyngeal aspirates were also assayed and were mostly of subtype N2. The 
region amplified was direct sequenced and then used in database searches to 
confirm the identity of the template RNA. The RT-PCR fragment generated includes 
one of the mutation sites related to oseltamivir resistance, H274Y.
CONCLUSION: Our one-step RT-PCR assay followed by sequencing is a rapid, 
accurate, and specific method for detection and subtyping of different 
neuraminidase subtypes from a range of host species and from different 
geographical locations.
