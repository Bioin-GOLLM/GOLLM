The question of how proneural bHLH transcription factors recognize and regulate 
their target genes is still relatively poorly understood. We previously showed 
that Scute (Sc) and Atonal (Ato) target genes have different cognate E box 
motifs, suggesting that specific DNA interactions contribute to differences in 
their target gene specificity. Here we show that Sc and Ato proteins (in 
combination with Daughterless) can activate reporter gene expression via their 
cognate E boxes in a non-neuronal cell culture system, suggesting that the 
proteins have strong intrinsic abilities to recognize different E box motifs in 
the absence of specialized cofactors. Functional comparison of E boxes from 
several target genes and site-directed mutagenesis of E box motifs suggests that 
specificity and activity require further sequence elements flanking both sides 
of the previously identified E box motifs. Moreover, the proneural cofactor, 
Senseless, can augment the function of Sc and Ato on their cognate E boxes and 
therefore may contribute to proneural specificity.
