Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped gram-negative bacterium. Its infection is 
mainly transmitted via oral-oral and fecal-oral routes usually during early 
childhood. It can achieve persistent colonization by manipulating the host 
immune responses, which also causes mucosal damage and inflammation. H. pylori 
gastritis is an infectious disease and results in chronic gastritis of different 
severity in near all patients with infection. It may develop from acute/chronic 
inflammation, chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and 
intraepithelial neoplasia, eventually to gastric cancer. This review attempts to 
cover recent studies which provide important insights into how H. pylori causes 
chronic inflammation and what the characteristic is, which will immunologically 
explain H. pylori gastritis.
