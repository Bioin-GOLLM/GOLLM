Drug resistance has remained an important issue in the treatment and prevention 
of various diseases, including cancer. Herein, we found that USP24 not only 
repressed DNA-damage repair (DDR) activity by decreasing Rad51 expression to 
cause the tumor genomic instability and cancer stemness, but also increased the 
levels of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-gp, ABCG2, and ezrin to 
enhance the pumping out of Taxol from cancer cells, thus resulted in drug 
resistance during cancer therapy. A novel USP24 inhibitor, NCI677397, was 
screened for specific inhibiting the catalytic activity of USP24. This inhibitor 
was identified to suppress drug resistance via decreasing genomic instability, 
cancer stemness, and the pumping out of drugs from cancer cells. Understanding 
the role and molecular mechanisms of USP24 in drug resistance will be beneficial 
for the future development of a novel USP24 inhibitor. Our studies provide a new 
insight of USP24 inhibitor for clinically implication of blocking drug 
resistance during chemotherapy.
