Large brain size is one of the defining characteristics of modern humans. Seckel 
syndrome (MIM 210600), a disorder of markedly reduced brain and body size, is 
associated with defective ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling. Only a single 
hypomorphic mutation of ATR has been identified in this genetically 
heterogeneous condition. We now report that mutations in the gene encoding 
pericentrin (PCNT)--resulting in the loss of pericentrin from the centrosome, 
where it has key functions anchoring both structural and regulatory 
proteins--also cause Seckel syndrome. Furthermore, we find that cells of 
individuals with Seckel syndrome due to mutations in PCNT (PCNT-Seckel) have 
defects in ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling, providing the first evidence 
linking a structural centrosomal protein with DNA damage signaling. These 
findings also suggest that other known microcephaly genes implicated in either 
DNA repair responses or centrosomal function may act in common developmental 
pathways determining human brain and body size.
