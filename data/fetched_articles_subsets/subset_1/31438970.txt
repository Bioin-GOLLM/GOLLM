BACKGROUND: Spaceflight or microgravity conditions cause myocardial atrophy and 
dysfunction, contributing to post-flight orthostatic intolerance. However, the 
underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood and preventive approaches 
are limited. This study investigated whether and how losartan, a blocker of 
angiotensin-II receptor, preserved cardiomyocyte size and prevented myocardial 
dysfunction during microgravity.
METHOD: Adult male mice were suspended with their tails to simulate 
microgravity. Echocardiography was performed to assess myocardial function. 
Heart weight and cardiomyocyte size were measured. NADPH oxidase activation was 
determined by analyzing membrane translocation of its cytosolic subunits 
including p47phox, p67phox and Rac1. Heart tissues were also assayed for 
oxidative stress, p47phox phosphorylation (Ser345), MuRF1 protein levels and 
angiotensin-II production.
RESULTS: Tail-suspension for 28Â days increased angiotensin-II production in 
hearts, decreased cardiomyocyte size and heart weight, and induced myocardial 
dysfunction. Administration of losartan preserved cardiomyocyte size and heart 
weight, and prevented myocardial dysfunction in tail-suspended mice. These 
cardioprotective effects of losartan were associated with inhibition of p47phox 
phosphorylation (Ser345), NADPH oxidase and oxidative stress in tail-suspended 
mouse hearts. Additionally, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, also reduced 
oxidative stress, preserved cardiomyocyte size and heart weight, and improved 
myocardial function in tail-suspended mice. Furthermore, losartan but not 
apocynin attenuated tail-suspension-induced up-regulation of MuRF1 protein in 
mouse hearts.
CONCLUSIONS: Administration of losartan preserves cardiomyocyte size and 
prevents myocardial dysfunction under microgravity by blocking p47phox 
phosphorylation and NADPH oxidase activation, and by inhibiting MuRF1 
expression. Thus, losartan may be a useful drug to prevent microgravity-induced 
myocardial abnormalities.
