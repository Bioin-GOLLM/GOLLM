UTX/KDM6A, a histone H3K27 demethylase and a key component of the COMPASS 
complex, is frequently lost or mutated in cancer; however, its tumor suppressor 
function remains largely uncharacterized in multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we show 
that the conditional deletion of the X-linked Utx in germinal center (GC) 
derived cells collaborates with the activating BrafV600E mutation and promotes 
induction of lethal GC/post-GC B cell malignancies with MM-like plasma cell 
neoplasms being the most frequent. Mice that developed MM-like neoplasms showed 
expansion of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and extramedullary organs, 
serum M proteins, and anemia. Add-back of either wild-type UTX or a series of 
mutants revealed that cIDR domain, that forms phase-separated liquid 
condensates, is largely responsible for the catalytic activity-independent tumor 
suppressor function of UTX in MM cells. Utx loss in concert with BrafV600E only 
slightly induced MM-like profiles of transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and 
H3K27 acetylation, however, it allowed plasma cells to gradually undergo full 
transformation through activation of transcriptional networks specific to MM 
that induce high levels of Myc expression. Our results reveal a tumor suppressor 
function of UTX in MM and implicate its insufficiency in the transcriptional 
reprogramming of plasma cells in the pathogenesis of MM.
