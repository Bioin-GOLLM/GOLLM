Protein-encapsulated gold nanoclusters have shown many advantages over other 
gold nanocluster systems, including green synthesis, biocompatibility, high 
water solubility, and the ease of further conjugation. In this article, we 
systematically investigated the effects of the protein size and amino acid 
content on the formation and fluorescent properties of gold nanoclusters using 
four model proteins (bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, trypsin, and pepsin). We 
discovered that the balance of amine and tyrosine/tryptophan containing residues 
was critical for the nanocluster formation. Protein templates with low cysteine 
contents caused blue shifts in the fluorescent emissions and difference in 
fluorescent lifetimes of the gold nanoclusters. Furthermore, the protein size 
was found to be a critical factor for the photostability and long-term stability 
of gold nanoclusters. The size of the protein also affected the Au nanocluster 
behaviour after immobilization.
