Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer proteins (PITPs) stimulate PtdIns-4-P 
synthesis and signaling in eukaryotic cells, but to what biological outcomes 
such signaling circuits are coupled remains unclear. Herein, we show that two 
highly related StART-like PITPs, PITPNA and PITPNB, act in a redundant fashion 
to support development of the embryonic mammalian neocortex. PITPNA/PITPNB do so 
by driving PtdIns-4-P-dependent recruitment of GOLPH3, and likely ceramide 
transfer protein (CERT), to Golgi membranes with GOLPH3 recruitment serving to 
promote MYO18A- and F-actin-directed loading of the Golgi network to apical 
processes of neural stem cells (NSCs). We propose the primary role for 
PITP/PtdIns-4-P/GOLPH3/CERT signaling in NSC Golgi is not in regulating bulk 
membrane trafficking but in optimizing apically directed membrane trafficking 
and/or apical membrane signaling during neurogenesis.
