Pesticide resistance in insects is an example of adaptive evolution occurring in 
pest species and is driven by the artificial introduction of pesticides. The 
diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), has 
evolved resistance to various insecticides. Understanding the genetic changes 
underpinning the resistance to pesticides is necessary for the implementation of 
pest control measures. We sequenced the genome of six resistant and six 
susceptible DBM individuals separately and inferred the genomic regions of 
greatest divergence between strains using FST and θπ. Among several genomic 
regions potentially related to insecticide resistance, CYP6B6-like was observed 
with significant divergence between the resistant and susceptible strains, with 
a missense mutation located near the substrate recognition site (SRS) and four 
SNPs in the promoter. To characterize the relative effects of directional 
selection via insecticide tolerance ('strain') as compared to acute exposure to 
insecticide ('treatment'), four pairwise comparisons were carried out between 
libraries to determine the differentially expressed genes. Most 
resistance-related differentially expressed genes were identified from the 
comparison of the strains and enriched in pathways for exogenous detoxification 
including cytochrome P450 and the ABC transporter. Further confirmation came 
from the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, which indicated that 
genes in the significant module associated with chlorantraniliprole resistance 
were enriched in pathways for exogenous detoxification, and that CYP6B6-like 
represented a hub gene in the "darkred" module. Furthermore, RNAi knock-down of 
CYP6B6-like increases P. xylostella sensitivity to chlorantraniliprole. Our 
study thus provides a genetic foundation underlying selection for pesticide 
resistance and plausible mechanisms to explain fast evolved adaptation through 
genomic divergence and altered gene expression in insects.
