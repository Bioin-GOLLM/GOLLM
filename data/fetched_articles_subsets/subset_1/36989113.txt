The extra-embryonic tissues that form the placenta originate from a small 
population of trophectoderm cells with stem cell properties, positioned at the 
embryonic pole of the mouse blastocyst. During the implantation stages, the 
polar trophectoderm rapidly proliferates and transforms into extra-embryonic 
ectoderm. The current model of trophoblast morphogenesis suggests that tissue 
folding reshapes the trophoblast during the blastocyst to egg cylinder 
transition. Instead of through folding, here we found that the tissue scale 
architecture of the stem cell compartment of the trophoblast lineage is 
reorganized via inversion of the epithelial polarity axis. Our findings show the 
developmental significance of polarity inversion and provide a framework for the 
morphogenetic transitions in the peri-implantation trophoblast.
