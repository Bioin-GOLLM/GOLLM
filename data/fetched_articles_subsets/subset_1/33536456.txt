Kinetoplastids are heterotrophic flagellated protists, including important 
parasites of humans and animals (trypanosomatids), and ecologically important 
free-living bacterial consumers (bodonids). Phylogenies have shown that the 
earliest-branching kinetoplastids are all parasites or obligate endosymbionts, 
whose highly-derived state makes reconstructing the ancestral state of the group 
challenging. We have isolated new strains of unusual free-living flagellates 
that molecular phylogeny shows to be most closely related to endosymbiotic and 
parasitic Perkinsela and Ichthyobodo species that, together with unidentified 
environmental sequences, form the clade at the base of kinetoplastids. These 
strains are therefore the first described free-living prokinetoplastids, and 
potentially very informative in understanding the evolution and ancestral states 
of morphological and molecular characteristics described in other 
kinetoplastids. Overall, we find that these organisms morphologically and 
ultrastructurally resemble some free-living bodonids and diplonemids, and 
possess nuclear genomes with few introns, polycistronic mRNA expression, high 
coding density, and derived traits shared with other kinetoplastids. Their 
genetic repertoires are more diverse than the best-studied free-living 
kinetoplastids, which is likely a reflection of their higher metabolic 
potential. Mitochondrial RNAs of these new species undergo the most extensive U 
insertion/deletion editing reported so far, and limited deaminative C-to-U and 
A-to-I editing, but we find no evidence for mitochondrial trans-splicing.
