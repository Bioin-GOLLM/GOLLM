Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. Heart failure, which contributes significantly to the incidence and 
prevalence of cardiovascular-related diseases, can be the result of a myriad of 
diverse aetiologies including viral infections, coronary heart disease and 
genetic abnormalities--just to name a few. Interestingly, almost every type of 
heart failure is characterized by the loss of cardiac myocytes, either via 
necrosis, apoptosis or autophagy. While the former for a long time mainly has 
been characterized by passive loss of cells and only the latter two have been 
regarded as active processes, a new view is now emerging, whereby all three 
forms of cell death are regarded as different types of programmed cell death 
which can be induced via different stimuli and pathways, most of which are 
probably not well understood (Kung et al., Circulation Research 
108(8):1017-1036, 2011). Here, we focus on the sarcomeric Z-disc, Z-disc 
transcriptional coupling and its role in pro-survival pathways as well as in 
striated muscle specific forms of cell death (sarcomeroptosis) and mechanically 
induced apoptosis or mechanoptosis.
