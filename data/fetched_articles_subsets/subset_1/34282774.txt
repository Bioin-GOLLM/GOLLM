Mastocytosis represents a heterogeneous group of neoplastic mast cell disorders. 
The basic classification into a skin-limited disease and a systemic form with 
multi-organ involvement remains valid. Systemic mastocytosis is a disease often 
hard to diagnose, characterized by different symptoms originating from either 
the release of mast cell mediators or organ damage due to mast cell 
infiltration. Gastrointestinal symptoms represent one of the major causes of 
morbidity, being present in 60-80% of patients. A high index of suspicion by 
clinicians and pathologists is required to reach the diagnosis. Gastrointestinal 
mastocytosis can be a challenging diagnosis, as symptoms simulate other more 
common gastrointestinal diseases. The endoscopic appearance is generally 
unremarkable or nonspecific and gastrointestinal mast cell infiltration can be 
focal and subtle, requiring an adequate sampling with multiple biopsies by the 
endoscopists. Special stains, such as CD117, tryptase, and CD25, should be 
performed in order not to miss the gastrointestinal mast cell infiltrate. A 
proper patient's workup requires a multidisciplinary approach including 
gastroenterologists, endoscopists, hematologists, oncologists, and pathologists. 
The aim of this review is to analyze the clinicopathological features of 
gastrointestinal involvement in systemic mastocytosis, focusing on the relevance 
of a multidisciplinary approach.
