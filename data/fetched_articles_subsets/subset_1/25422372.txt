Epithelial cells from diverse tissues, including the enterocytes that line the 
intestinal tract, remodel their apical surface during differentiation to form a 
brush border: an array of actin-supported membrane protrusions known as 
microvilli that increases the functional capacity of the tissue. Although our 
understanding of how epithelial cells assemble, stabilize, and organize apical 
microvilli is still developing, investigations of the biochemical and physical 
underpinnings of these processes suggest that cells coordinate cytoskeletal 
remodeling, membrane-cytoskeleton cross-linking, and extracellular adhesion to 
shape the apical brush border domain.
