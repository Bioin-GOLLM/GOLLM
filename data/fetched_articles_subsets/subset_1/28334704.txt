BACKGROUND/AIM: The McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a potentially severe 
disorder hallmarked by fibrous bone dysplasia, café-au-lait skin spots, and 
endocrine hyperfunction. It is caused by postzygotic activating mutations at the 
R201 codon of the GNAS gene, leading to a state of somatic mosaicism. Our aim 
was to improve the mutation detection rate and to quantify the presence of R201 
GNAS mutations in different DNA samples from MAS patients.
METHODS: Real-time COLD- and MAMA-PCR TaqMan techniques were combined to search 
for R201 mutations in the DNA of blood or affected tissues from 16 previously 
molecularly characterized MAS patients, from a further 84 subjects with MAS 
signs who were R201 negative at RFLP analysis, and from 36 controls. The ability 
of this new method to provide quantitative data was tested in the serial 
dilution of wild-type, R201H, or R201C cloned plasmid DNA samples; the mutant 
abundance was measured by spectrophotometry.
RESULTS: A linear correlation between the true and the relative mutant abundance 
was observed until 2.5%, indicating a reliable quantification of R201 mutations. 
The assay's sensitivity was 0.05%, similar to that of previously described 
molecular methods.
CONCLUSION: The real-time COLD-MAMA-PCR approach is a rapid, efficient, and 
inexpensive molecular technique for the identification of mutant alleles poorly 
represented in DNA samples. .
