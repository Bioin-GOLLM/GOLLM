Polarized epithelial cells contain apical and basolateral surfaces with distinct 
protein compositions. To establish and maintain this asymmetry, newly made 
plasma membrane proteins are sorted in the trans Golgi network for delivery to 
apical or basolateral surfaces. Signals for basolateral sorting are generally 
located in the cytoplasmic domain of the protein, whereas signals for apical 
sorting can be in any part of the protein and can depend on N-linked 
glycosylation of the protein. Signals for constitutive transcytosis to the 
apical surface have not been reported. In this study, we used the polymeric 
immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which is biosynthetically delivered to the 
basolateral surface. There the pIgR can bind a ligand and, with or without bound 
ligand, the pIgR can then be transcytosed to the apical surface. We found that 
the glycosylation of the pIgR did not affect the biosynthetic transport of the 
pIgR. However, glycosylation had an effect on pIgR apical transcytosis. 
Importantly, analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the pIgR suggested that a short 
peptide segment was sufficient to transcytose the pIgR or a neutral reporter 
from the basolateral to the apical surface. This apical transcytosis sorting 
signal was not involved in polarized biosynthetic traffic of the pIgR.
