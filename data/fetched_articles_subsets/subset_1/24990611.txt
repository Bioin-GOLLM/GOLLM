Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survival approaches 90%. New strategies 
are needed to identify the 10-15% who evade cure. We applied targeted, 
sequencing-based genotyping of 25 000 to 34 000 preselected potentially 
clinically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify host 
genome profiles associated with relapse risk in 352 patients from the Nordic 
ALL92/2000 protocols and 426 patients from the German Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster 
(BFM) ALL2000 protocol. Patients were enrolled between 1992 and 2008 (median 
follow-up: 7.6 years). Eleven cross-validated SNPs were significantly associated 
with risk of relapse across protocols. SNP and biologic pathway level analyses 
associated relapse risk with leukemia aggressiveness, glucocorticosteroid 
pharmacology/response and drug transport/metabolism pathways. Classification and 
regression tree analysis identified three distinct risk groups defined by end of 
induction residual leukemia, white blood cell count and variants in 
myeloperoxidase (MPO), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), lamin B1 (LMNB1) and matrix 
metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) genes, ATP-binding cassette transporters and 
glucocorticosteroid transcription regulation pathways. Relapse rates ranged from 
4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6-6.3%) for the best group (72% of patients) 
to 76% (95% CI: 41-90%) for the worst group (5% of patients, P<0.001). 
Validation of these findings and similar approaches to identify SNPs associated 
with toxicities may allow future individualized relapse and toxicity risk-based 
treatments adaptation.
