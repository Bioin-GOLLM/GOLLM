Mammary tumours (MT) are one of the most prevalent malignancies in female dogs 
and women. Currently, molecular analyzes have shown that each tumour type 
presents its own genetic signature. In this context, liquid biopsy allows a 
comprehensive genetic characterisation of the tumour, enabling early diagnosis 
and personalised treatment of patients. In women, deleterious mutations 
inherited in BRCA2 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, 
resistance to therapies and worse prognosis. In female dogs, there are many 
divergent data on the involvement of BRCA2 gene with mammary carcinogenesis and 
what its pathogenic potential is. Therefore, the objective was to identify BRCA2 
gene variants in 20 plasma DNA samples, from 10 newly diagnosed dogs with 
mammary cancer (RD), five control (CTR) and five mastectomized patients. Eleven 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, most of them in the exon 
11 and two indels (deletion/insertion) in the BRCA2 gene. However, there was no 
statistically significant difference in the SNPs/indels detected between the 
groups. In addition, only one SNP (p.T1425P) and one deletion (p.L2307del) were 
considered deleterious using in silico computational models. Interestingly, most 
common variants were present in the plasma of all groups, except for the 
Ile2614Thr, Ile2614Val, Thr1425Pro and p.L2307del variants. Thus, we observed 
that SNPs are common in the BRCA2 gene of female dogs with MT, with a similar 
condition identified in women with breast cancer. Liquid biopsy approach in dogs 
with MT is useful for genetic and therapeutic proposals.
