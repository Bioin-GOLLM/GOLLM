Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the 
ribosome and thereby plays a key role in protein synthesis. Human eEF1A is 
subject to extensive post-translational methylation, but several of the 
responsible enzymes remain unknown. Using a wide range of experimental 
approaches, we here show that human methyltransferase (MTase)-like protein 13 
(METTL13) contains two distinct MTase domains targeting the N terminus and Lys55 
of eEF1A, respectively. Our biochemical and structural analyses provide detailed 
mechanistic insights into recognition of the eEF1A N terminus by METTL13. 
Moreover, through ribosome profiling, we demonstrate that loss of METTL13 
function alters translation dynamics and results in changed translation rates of 
specific codons. In summary, we here unravel the function of a human MTase, 
showing that it methylates eEF1A and modulates mRNA translation in a 
codon-specific manner.
