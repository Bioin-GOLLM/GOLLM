A total of 51 goats, including seven clinical cases, from the first herd in 
Greece reported to have scrapie was examined to discern an association between 
scrapie susceptibility and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the prion protein 
(PrP). Each animal was evaluated for clinical signs of the disease, 
histopathological lesions associated with scrapie, the presence of detectable 
protease-resistant PrP in the brain and PrP genotype. Eleven different PrP 
genotypes encoding at least five unique predicted mature PrP amino acid 
sequences were found. These genotypes included the amino acid polymorphisms at 
codons 143 (H-->R) and 240 (S-->P) and 'silent' nucleotide alterations at codons 
42 (a-->g) and 138 (c-->t). Additionally, novel caprine amino acid polymorphisms 
were detected at codons 21 (V-->A), 23 (L-->P), 49 (G-->S), 154 (R-->H), 168 
(P-->Q) and 220 (Q-->H) and new silent mutations were found at codons 107 
(g-->a) and 207 (g-->a). The following variants were found in scrapie-affected 
goats: VV(21), LL(23), GG(49,) SS(49), HH(143), HR(143), RR(154), PP(168), 
PP(240), SP(240) and SS(240). All scrapie-affected animals carried the 
HH(143)RR(154) genotype, with the exception of two goats (HR(143)), both of 
which had detectable protease-resistant PrP but showed no clinical signs or 
histopathological lesions characteristic of scrapie.
