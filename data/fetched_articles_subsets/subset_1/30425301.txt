PURPOSE: We aimed to assess the biological and clinical significance of the 
human cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin M/E, encoded by the CTS6 gene, in 
diseases of human hair and skin.
METHODS: Exome and Sanger sequencing was performed to reveal the genetic cause 
in two related patients with hypotrichosis. Immunohistochemical, biophysical, 
and biochemical measurements were performed on patient skin and 3D-reconstructed 
skin from patient-derived keratinocytes.
RESULTS: We identified a homozygousÂ variant c.361C>T (p.Gln121*), resulting in a 
premature stop codon in exon 2 of CST6 associated with hypotrichosis, eczema, 
blepharitis, photophobia and impaired sweating. Enzyme assays using recombinant 
mutant cystatin M/E protein, generated by site-directed mutagenesis, revealed 
that this p.Gln121* variant was unable to inhibit any of its three target 
proteases (legumain and cathepsins L and V). Three-dimensional protein structure 
prediction confirmed the disturbance of the protease/inhibitor binding sites of 
legumain and cathepsins L and V in the p.Gln121* variant.
CONCLUSION: The herein characterized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis syndrome 
indicates an important role of human cystatin M/E in epidermal homeostasis and 
hair follicle morphogenesis.
