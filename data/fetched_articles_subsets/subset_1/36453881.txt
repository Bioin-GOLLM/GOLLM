Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention or cure strategies 
must inhibit transmitted/founder and reservoir viruses. Establishing sensitivity 
of circulating viruses to bNAbs and genetic patterns affecting neutralization 
variability may guide rational bNAbs selection for clinical development. We 
analyzed 326 single env genomes from nine individuals followed longitudinally 
following acute HIV-1 infection, with samples collected at ~1 week after the 
first detection of plasma viremia; 300 to 1,709 days postinfection but prior to 
initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) (median = 724 days); and ~1 year post 
ART initiation. Sequences were assessed for phylogenetic relatedness, potential 
N- and O-linked glycosylation, and variable loop lengths (V1 to V5). A total of 
43 env amplicons (median = 3 per patient per time point) were cloned into an 
expression vector and the TZM-bl assay was used to assess the neutralization 
profiles of 15 bNAbs targeting the CD4 binding site, V1/V2 region, V3 supersite, 
MPER, gp120/gp41 interface, and fusion peptide. At 1 μg/mL, the neutralization 
breadths were as follows: VRC07-LS and N6.LS (100%), VRC01 (86%), PGT151 (81%), 
10-1074 and PGT121 (80%), and less than 70% for 10E8, 3BNC117, CAP256.VRC26, 
4E10, PGDM1400, and N123-VRC34.01. Features associated with low sensitivity to 
V1/V2 and V3 bNAbs were higher potential glycosylation sites and/or relatively 
longer V1 and V4 domains, including known "signature" mutations. The study shows 
significant variability in the breadth and potency of bNAbs against circulating 
HIV-1 subtype C envelopes. VRC07-LS, N6.LS, VRC01, PGT151, 10-1074, and PGT121 
display broad activity against subtype C variants, and major determinants of 
sensitivity to most bNAbs were within the V1/V4 domains. IMPORTANCE Broadly 
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have potential clinical utility in HIV-1 
prevention and cure strategies. However, bNAbs target diverse epitopes on the 
HIV-1 envelope and the virus may evolve to evade immune responses. It is 
therefore important to identify antibodies with broad activity in high 
prevalence settings, as well as the genetic patterns that may lead to 
neutralization escape. We investigated 15 bNAbs with diverse biophysical 
properties that target six epitopes of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein for their 
ability to inhibit viruses that initiated infection, viruses circulating in 
plasma at chronic infection before antiretroviral treatment (ART), or viruses 
that were archived in the reservoir during ART in subtype C infected individuals 
in South Africa, a high burden country. We identify the antibodies most likely 
to be effective for clinical use in this setting and describe mutational 
patterns associated with neutralization escape from these antibodies.
