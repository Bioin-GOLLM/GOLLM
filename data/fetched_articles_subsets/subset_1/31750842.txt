Covering: 2000 to 2019The discovery of new natural products that have some 
combination of unprecedented chemical structures, biological activities of 
therapeutic interest for urgent medical needs, and new molecular targets 
provides the fuel that sustains the vitality of natural products chemistry 
research. Unfortunately, finding these important new compounds is neither 
routine or trivial and a major challenge is finding effective discovery 
paradigms. This review presents examples that illustrate the effectiveness of a 
chemical genetics approach to marine natural product (MNP) discovery that 
intertwines compound discovery, molecular target identification, and phenotypic 
response/biological activity. The examples include MNPs that have complex 
unprecedented structures, new or understudied molecular targets, and potent 
biological activities of therapeutic interest. A variety of methods to identify 
molecular targets are also featured.
