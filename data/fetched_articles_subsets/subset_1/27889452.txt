Repetitive genomic regions include tandem sequence repeats and interspersed 
repeats, such as endogenous retroviruses and LINE-1 elements. Repressive 
heterochromatin domains silence expression of these sequences through mechanisms 
that remain poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that the retinoblastoma 
protein (pRB) utilizes a cell-cycle-independent interaction with E2F1 to recruit 
enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to diverse repeat sequences. These include 
simple repeats, satellites, LINEs, and endogenous retroviruses as well as 
transposon fragments. We generated a mutant mouse strain carrying an F832A 
mutation in Rb1 that is defective for recruitment to repetitive sequences. Loss 
of pRB-EZH2 complexes from repeats disperses H3K27me3 from these genomic 
locations and permits repeat expression. Consistent with maintenance of H3K27me3 
at the Hox clusters, these mice are developmentally normal. However, 
susceptibility to lymphoma suggests that pRB-EZH2 recruitment to repetitive 
elements may be cancer relevant.
