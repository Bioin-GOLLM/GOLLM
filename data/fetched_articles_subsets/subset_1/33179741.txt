Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a sideways curvature of the spine, is the 
most common pediatric musculoskeletal disorder, affecting ~3% of the population 
worldwide. However, its genetic bases and tissues of origin remain largely 
unknown. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated 
nucleotide variants in non-coding sequences that control genes with important 
roles in cartilage, muscle, bone, connective tissue and intervertebral disks 
(IVDs) as drivers of AIS susceptibility. Here, we set out to define the 
expression of AIS-associated genes and active regulatory elements by performing 
RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing against H3 lysine 27 
acetylation in these tissues in mouse and human. Our study highlights genetic 
pathways involving AIS-associated loci that regulate chondrogenesis, IVD 
development and connective tissue maintenance and homeostasis. In addition, we 
identify thousands of putative AIS-associated regulatory elements which may 
orchestrate tissue-specific expression in musculoskeletal tissues of the spine. 
Quantification of enhancer activity of several candidate regulatory elements 
from our study identifies three functional enhancers carrying AIS-associated 
GWAS SNPs at the ADGRG6 and BNC2 loci. Our findings provide a novel genome-wide 
catalog of AIS-relevant genes and regulatory elements and aid in the 
identification of novel targets for AIS causality and treatment.
