Emicizumab is increasingly the front-line treatment for patients with Hemophilia 
A with or without inhibitors. Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome of muscle necrosis 
and release of intracellular muscle constituents into the circulation. Creatine 
kinase (CK) levels are typically markedly elevated, and muscle pain and 
myoglobinuria may be present. The severity of illness ranges from asymptomatic 
elevations in serum muscle enzymes to life-threatening disease associated with 
extreme enzyme elevations, electrolyte imbalances, acute kidney injury and 
disseminated intravascular coagulation. We present a case of an African American 
male with severe hemophilia A and history of factor VIII inhibitor, maintained 
on emicizumab prophylaxis, who developed rhabdomyolysis with a symptomatic 
hyperCKemia. To date, there is no known link between rhabdomyolysis to 
emicizumab. This report brings to light the possibility of symptomatic 
rhabdomyolysis as a potential side effect of emicizumab after moderate 
exertional activity.
