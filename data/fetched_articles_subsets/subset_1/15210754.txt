The A2A adenosine receptor plays a critical role in the physiologic 
immunosuppressive pathway that protects normal tissues from excessive collateral 
damage by overactive immune cells and their proinflammatory cytokines. In this 
study, we examine and clarify the mechanism of tissue protection by 
extracellular adenosine using A2AR-deficient mice and show that the A2AR 
inhibits TLR-induced transcription of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo. The 
observed increase in proinflammatory cytokines mRNA in A2AR-deficient mice was 
associated with enhanced activity of the NF-kappaB transcription factor. These 
observations provide the genetic in vivo evidence for attenuation of 
proinflammatory transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB by a "metabokine" 
adenosine and point to the need to re-evaluate the regulation of other 
transcription factors in hypoxic and adenosine-rich microenvironments of 
inflamed normal tissues and solid tumors.
