BACKGROUND: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) deficiency is a 
severe immunodeficiency with clinical features including hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) due to defective 
NOD2 responses. Management includes immunomodulatory therapies and hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, this cohort is particularly susceptible to 
the chemotherapeutic regimens and acutely affected by graft-vs-host disease 
(GvHD), driving poor long-term survival in transplanted patients. Autologous HSC 
gene therapy could offer an alternative treatment option and would abrogate the 
risks of alloreactivity.
METHODS: Hematopoietic progenitor (Lin-ve) cells from XIAPy/- mice were 
transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding human XIAP cDNA before 
transplantation into irradiated XIAP y/- recipients. After 12 weeks animals were 
challenged with the dectin-1 ligand curdlan and recovery of innate immune 
function was evaluated though analysis of inflammatory cytokines, body weight, 
and splenomegaly. XIAP patient-derived CD14+ monocytes were transduced with the 
same vector and functional recovery was demonstrated using in vitro L18-MDP/NOD2 
assays.
RESULTS: In treated XIAPy/- mice, ~40% engraftment of gene-corrected Lin-ve 
cells led to significant recovery of weight loss, splenomegaly, and inflammatory 
cytokine responses to curdlan, comparable to wild-type mice. Serum IL-6, IL-10, 
MCP-1, and TNF were significantly reduced 2-h post-curdlan administration in 
non-corrected XIAPy/- mice compared to wild-type and gene-corrected animals. 
Appropriate reduction of inflammatory responses was observed in gene-corrected 
mice, whereas non-corrected mice developed an inflammatory profile 9 days 
post-curdlan challenge. In gene-corrected patient CD14+ monocytes, TNF responses 
were restored following NOD2 activation with L18-MDP.
CONCLUSION: Gene correction of HSCs recovers XIAP-dependent immune defects and 
could offer a treatment option for patients with XIAP deficiency.
