Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) compartmentalizes and concentrates 
biomacromolecules into distinct condensates. Liquid-like condensates can 
transition into gel and solid states, which are essential for fulfilling their 
different functions. LLPS plays important roles in multiple steps of autophagy, 
mediating the assembly of autophagosome formation sites, acting as an 
unconventional modulator of TORC1-mediated autophagy regulation, and triaging 
protein cargos for degradation. Gel-like, but not solid, protein condensates can 
trigger formation of surrounding autophagosomal membranes. Stress and 
pathological conditions cause aberrant phase separation and transition of 
condensates, which can evade surveillance by the autophagy machinery. 
Understanding the mechanisms underlying phase separation and transition will 
provide potential therapeutic targets for protein aggregation diseases.
