BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients are at increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) are increased in OSA 
and CAM are also implicated in the development of CVD.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Do CAM (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin) have prognostic value 
in identifying risk of cardiovascular events in OSA?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with suspected OSA referred for a 
polysomnogram provided a fasting blood sample. Plasma levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 
and E-selectin were determined by multiplex Luminex Assay (Milliporesigma ON, 
Canada). Cardiovascular events were determined by deterministic linkage to 
provincial health databases.
RESULTS: 418 patients were included in the analysis. Mostly male (68.2%), mean 
age of 50.7 yrs, median AHI 16.5 events/hour, and mean BMI of 31.7 kg/m2. 36 
cardiovascular events occurred in 8-yrs of follow up. Higher levels of ICAM-1 
were associated with developing CVD (HR = 3.65 95% CI 1.40-9.53, 2nd and 3rd 
tertiles vs. 1st tertile), including in patients with OSA (HR = 3.1 95% CI 
1.16-8.25). E-selectin was significantly associated with cardiovascular events 
in patients with moderate to severe OSA (HR = 3.31 95% CI 0.94-11.72, 2nd and 
3rd tertiles vs. 1st tertile) but not in patients without moderate to severe OSA 
(HR = 0.67 95% CI 0.19-2.38), p-value for interaction = 0.07.
INTERPRETATION: In a suspected OSA cohort, patients with higher levels of ICAM-1 
(>816 ng/ml) were significantly more likely to experience a cardiovascular event 
within 8 years after PSG. In moderate to severe OSA patients, a higher 
E-selectin (>36.4 ng/ml) was significantly associated with cardiovascular 
events.
