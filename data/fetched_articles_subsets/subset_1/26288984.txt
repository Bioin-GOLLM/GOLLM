OBJECTIVE: Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is 
caused by mutations in the SACS gene. SACS encodes sacsin, a protein whose 
function remains unknown, despite the description of numerous protein domains 
and the recent focus on its potential role in the regulation of mitochondrial 
physiology. This study aimed to identify new mutations in a large population of 
ataxic patients and to functionally analyze their cellular effects in the 
mitochondrial compartment.
METHODS: A total of 321 index patients with spastic ataxia selected from the 
SPATAX network were analyzed by direct sequencing of the SACS gene, and 156 
patients from the ATAXIC project presenting with congenital ataxia were 
investigated either by targeted or whole exome sequencing. For functional 
analyses, primary cultures of fibroblasts were obtained from 11 patients 
carrying either mono- or biallelic variants, including 1 case harboring a large 
deletion encompassing the entire SACS gene.
RESULTS: We identified biallelic SACS variants in 33 patients from SPATAX, and 
in 5 nonprogressive ataxia patients from ATAXIC. Moreover, a drastic and 
recurrent alteration of the mitochondrial network was observed in 10 of the 11 
patients tested.
INTERPRETATION: Our results permit extension of the clinical and mutational 
spectrum of ARSACS patients. Moreover, we suggest that the observed 
mitochondrial network anomalies could be used as a trait biomarker for the 
diagnosis of ARSACS when SACS molecular results are difficult to interpret (ie, 
missense variants and heterozygous truncating variant). Based on our findings, 
we propose new diagnostic definitions for ARSACS using clinical, genetic, and 
cellular criteria.
