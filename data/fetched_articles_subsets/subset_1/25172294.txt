BACKGROUND: Mechanisms involved in wound healing play some role in 
carcinogenesis in multiple organs, likely by creating a chronic inflammatory 
milieu. This study sought to assess the role of genetic markers in selected 
inflammation-related genes involved in wound healing (interleukin (IL)-1a, 
IL-1b, IL-1 Receptor type I (IL-1Ra), IL-1 Receptor type II (IL-1Rb), tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 
(TNFRSF)1A, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB)1, NF-kB2, inducible nitric oxide 
synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, hypoxia induced factor (HIF)-1α, 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A and P-53) in risk to oesophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
METHODS: We genotyped 125 tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s in 410 cases 
and 377 age and sex matched disease-free individuals from Nutritional 
Intervention Trial (NIT) cohort, and 546 cases and 556 controls individually 
matched for age, sex and neighbourhood from Shanxi case-control study, both 
conducted in high-risk areas of north-central China (1985-2007). Cox 
proportional-hazard models and conditional logistic regression models were used 
for SNPs analyses for NIT and Shanxi, respectively. Fisher's inverse test 
statistics were used to obtain gene-level significance.
RESULTS: Multiple SNPs were significantly associated with OSCC in both studies, 
however, none retained their significance after a conservative Bonferroni 
adjustment. Empiric p-values for tag SNPs in VEGFA in NIT were highly 
concentrated in the lower tail of the distribution, suggesting this gene may be 
influencing risk. Permutation tests confirmed the significance of this pattern. 
At the gene level, VEGFA yielded an empiric significance (P=0.027) in NIT. We 
also observed some evidence for interaction between environmental factors and 
some VEGFA tag SNPs.
CONCLUSION: Our finding adds further evidence for a potential role for markers 
in the VEGFA gene in the development and progression of early precancerous 
lesions of oesophagus.
