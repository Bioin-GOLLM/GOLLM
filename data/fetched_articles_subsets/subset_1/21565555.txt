This study investigated the association of common polymorphisms of the 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene with recurrent miscarriage (RM) 
among North Indian women. A total of 200 patients with unexplained recurrent 
miscarriages and 300 controls were genotyped for six polymorphic regions of eNOS 
by PCR, re-sequencing and RFLP. The GG genotype of 12862A>G, the G allele of 
Glu298Asp and the aa genotype of intron 4VNTR increased the risk of RM by 
∼1.8-fold, ∼3.5-fold and ∼2-fold, respectively (odds ratio (OR) 1.84, 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) 1.19-2.86, P=0.0066; OR 3.58, 95% CI 2.12-6.03, 
P<0.0001; and OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.04-4.77, P=0.0493). Two haplotypes were found to 
have a significant protective effect against RM (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.82, 
P=0.0009; and OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.19-0.81, P=0.0149) and another was found to 
increase the risk of RM by ∼2-fold (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.16-3.89 P=0.0195). In 
conclusion three common polymorphisms of eNOS gene, 12862A>G, Glu298Asp and 
intron 4VNTR increase the risk of RM in North Indian women. Risk of RM may also 
be modified by the presence of particular haplotypes.
