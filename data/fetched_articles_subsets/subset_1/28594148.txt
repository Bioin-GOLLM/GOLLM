BACKGROUND: As the leading cause of congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy 
represents a heterogenous group of heart muscle disorders. Despite considerable 
progress being made in the genetic diagnosis of cardiomyopathy by detection of 
the mutations in the most prevalent cardiomyopathy genes, the cause remains 
unsolved in many patients. High-throughput mutation screening in the disease 
genes for cardiomyopathy is now possible because of using target enrichment 
followed by next-generation sequencing. The aim of the study was to analyze a 
panel of genes associated with dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy based on 
previously published results in order to identify the subjects at risk.
METHODS: The method of next-generation sequencing by IlluminaHiSeq 2500 platform 
was used to detect sequence variants in 16 individuals diagnosed with dilated or 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Detected variants were filtered and the functional 
impact of amino acid changes was predicted by computational programs.
RESULTS: DNA samples of the 16 patients were analyzed by whole exome sequencing. 
We identified six nonsynonymous variants that were shown to be pathogenic in all 
used prediction softwares: rs3744998 (EPG5), rs11551768 (MGME1), rs148374985 
(MURC), rs78461695 (PLEC), rs17158558 (RET) and rs2295190 (SYNE1). Two of the 
analyzed sequence variants had minor allele frequency (MAF)<0.01: rs148374985 
(MURC), rs34580776 (MYBPC3).
CONCLUSION: Our data support the potential role of the detected variants in 
pathogenesis of dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; however, the possibility 
that these variants might not be true disease-causing variants but are 
susceptibility alleles that require additional mutations or injury to cause the 
clinical phenotype of disease must be considered.
