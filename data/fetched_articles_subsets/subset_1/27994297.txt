BACKGROUND: This observational, cross-sectional study investigates the impact of 
medication usage, physical activity (PA) and nutritional status on 
musculoskeletal health (MSH) in males and females aged 40-65 in the population 
of a post conflict, developing country.
METHODS: Bone Mineral Density (BMD), T-score and Z-score at distal forearm 
regions (measured by DEXA scan), together with isometric hand grip strength 
(dynamometer) were evaluated in a total of 162 subjects (53 Males, average age 
55.15±7.12 and 109 Females, 54.27±5.1). Additionally, bio-anthropometric 
assessments, medication usage, PA level and nutritional status were assessed.
RESULTS: Significant differences (p<0.05) were found in total subjects Body Mass 
Index (BMI), PA, BMD, T-score and Hand grip between genders. 42% of total 
participants met the diagnostic criteria of, out of which 6.8% with T-score 
below -2, while no cases of Osteoporosis was recorded. N05B Anxiolytics and A02B 
Drugs for peptic ulcer and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease medication groups 
consumption turned to have no significant differences (p>0.05) in BMD, T-score, 
and hand grip in total population, except for A02B where p<0.05 were found in 
Hand grip, as well as between female consumers and no consumers in all 
variables. Meanwhile, in total subjects consuming H02AB Glucocorticoids p<0.05 
were observed in BMD and T-score, but not on hand grip.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a low risk for MSH problems amongst the studied 
population in Kosova, while the consumption of H02AB medication group in both 
genders and A02B in females only for extended periods might effect MSH, 
therefore appropriate benefit/risk assessment should be made before prescribing 
these medications, notwithstanding age, gender, PA or nutritional status.
