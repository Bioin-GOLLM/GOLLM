BACKGROUND: Electron transfer flavoprotein is a mitochondrial matrix protein 
composed of alpha- and beta-subunits (ETF alpha and ETF beta, respectively). 
This protein transfers electrons between several mitochondrial dehydrogenases 
and the main respiratory chain via ETF dehydrogenase (ETF-DH). Defects in ETF or 
ETF-DH cause glutaric acidemias type II (GAII).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the molecular basis of ETF alpha 
deficiency in two Japanese children with different clinical phenotypes using 
expression study.
RESULTS: Patient 1 had the severe form of GAII, a compound heterozygote of two 
mutations: 799G to A (alpha G267R) and nonsense 7C to T (alpha R3X). Patient 2 
had the mild form and carried two heterozygous mutations: 764G to T (alpha 
G255V) and 478delG (frameshift). Both patients had one each of missense 
mutations in one allele; the others were either nonsense or truncated. 
Restriction enzyme digestion assay using genomic DNAs from 100 healthy Japanese 
revealed that these mutations were all novel. No signal for ETF alpha was 
detected by immunoblotting in cases of missense mutants, while wild-type cDNA 
resulted in expression of ETF alpha protein. Transfection with wild-type ETF 
alpha cDNA into cultured cells from both patients elevated incorporation of 
radioisotope-labelled fatty acids.
CONCLUSION: These four mutations were pathogenic for GAII and missense 
mutations, alpha G255V and alpha G267R were considered anecdotal for mild and 
severe forms, respectively.
