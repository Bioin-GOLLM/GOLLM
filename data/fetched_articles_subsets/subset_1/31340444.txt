Societal and environmental pressures demand high-quality and resilient cropping 
plants and plant-based foods grown with the use of low or no synthetic chemical 
inputs. Mild strain cross-protection (MSCP), the pre-immunization of a plant 
using a mild strain of a virus to protect against subsequent infection by a 
severe strain of the virus, fits with future-proofing of production systems. New 
examples of MSCP use have occurred recently. New technologies are converging to 
support the discovery and mechanism(s) of action of MSCP strains thereby 
accelerating the popularity of their use.
