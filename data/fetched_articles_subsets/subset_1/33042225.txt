BACKGROUND: Despite evidence for beneficial effects of Qishen Yiqi Drop Pill 
(QSYQ) on congestive heart failure, the majority of studies are based on 
insufficient sample sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic 
effects of QSYQ using a meta-analysis approach. Methodology/Principal Findings. 
All relevant studies published before December 31, 2019, were identified by 
searches of various databases with key search terms. In total, 85 studies 
involving 8,579 participants were included. The addition of QSYQ to routine 
Western medicine increased 6-minute walking distance (SMD = 2.08, 95% CI: 
1.72-2.44, p < 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (SMD = 1.05, 95% CI: 
0.87-1.23, p < 0.001), and cardiac index (SMD = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.92-1.95, p < 
0.001) and reduced brain natriuretic peptide (SMD = -2.28, 95% CI: -2.81 to 
-1.76, p < 0.001), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (SMD = 
-2.49, 95% CI: -3.24 to -1.73, p < 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic 
dimensions (SMD = -0.92, 95% CI: -1.25 to -0.59, p < 0.001), and left 
ventricular end-systolic dimensions (SMD = -0.55, 95% CI: -0.89 to -0.21, p < 
0.001). The results were stable in subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our current meta-analysis indicated that QSYQ combined with Western 
therapy might be effective in CHF patients. Further researches are needed to 
identify which subgroups of CHF patients will benefit most and what kind of 
combination medicines work best.
