Keeping the intact germinal vesicle (GV) is essential for maintaining the 
capacity of mammals including human. It is maintained by very complex procedures 
along with folliculogenesis and is a critical step for getting competent oocyte. 
So far, a few mechanisms involved in folliculogenesis are known but GV arrest 
mechanisms are largely unrevealed. Cyclic AMP, a adenosine derived substance, 
have been used as inhibitor of germinal vesicle breakdown as a putative oocyte 
maturation inhibitor. In this study, we examined the potency of adenosine as GV 
maintainer and a possible signaling mediator for that. A1, A2b, and A3 were 
detected in cumulus cells of cumulus enclosed-oocyte (CEO). Intact of germinal 
vesicle was not kept like in follicle but the spontaneous maturation was 
inhibited by exogenous adenosine. It is inhibited with concentration dependent 
manners. Intracellular calcium level of cumulus was extensively increased after 
adenosine treatment. Based on these results it is suggested that one of the 
pathway for GV arrest by adenosine and its receptors is calcium mediated 
signaling pathway in CEO.
