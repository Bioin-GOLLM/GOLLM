BACKGROUND: . The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused an unexpected 
rebound globally. The World Health Organization has listed three variants 
(B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) as variants of concern. To understand the 
epidemiology and thereby plan appropriate safety measures, differential 
identification of the variants is indeed critical.
OBJECTIVES: . Although whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for variant 
identification, it is time-consuming and relatively expensive. Therefore, a 
rapid, easy, and cost-effective platform targeting multiple regions of the 
genome is required. Here, we assessed the usefulness of the Novaplex™ SARS-CoV-2 
Variants I Assay kit in identifying mutations in the variants.
STUDY DESIGN: . We retrospectively examined 30 stored nasal swabs from 
COVID-19-positive patients tested between November 2020 and March 2021. RNA 
extracted from these swabs was subjected to the commercial kit and real-time 
reverse transcription-PCR was performed. To determine the genome sequences of 
SARS-CoV-2 in the collected samples and deduce the consensus sequences among the 
identified variants, genome sequencing libraries were prepared and mapped to the 
reference genome.
RESULTS: . Four of the tested samples were determined as variants. Of them, two 
harbored both H69/V70 deletion and N501Y substitution, whereas two harbored 
E484K substitution alone.
CONCLUSIONS: . The variant with E484K substitution alone ("R.1") has been now 
categorized as a variant of interest in Japan. Additionally, the kit-based assay 
was found to be feasible, convenient, and user-friendly in identifying the 
abovementioned mutations with a turnaround time of only 2 h.
