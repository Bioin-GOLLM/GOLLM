Structural heterogeneity of particles can be investigated by their 
three-dimensional principal components. This paper addresses the question of 
whether, and with what algorithm, the three-dimensional principal components can 
be directly recovered from cryo-EM images. The first part of the paper extends 
the Fourier slice theorem to covariance functions showing that the 
three-dimensional covariance, and hence the principal components, of a 
heterogeneous particle can indeed be recovered from two-dimensional cryo-EM 
images. The second part of the paper proposes a practical algorithm for 
reconstructing the principal components directly from cryo-EM images without the 
intermediate step of calculating covariances. This algorithm is based on 
maximizing the posterior likelihood using the Expectation-Maximization 
algorithm. The last part of the paper applies this algorithm to simulated data 
and to two real cryo-EM data sets: a data set of the 70S ribosome with and 
without Elongation Factor-G (EF-G), and a data set of the influenza virus RNA 
dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP). The first principal component of the 70S 
ribosome data set reveals the expected conformational changes of the ribosome as 
the EF-G binds and unbinds. The first principal component of the RdRP data set 
reveals a conformational change in the two dimers of the RdRP.
