OBJECTIVES: Acquiring central venous pressure (CVP), an important clinical 
parameter, requires an invasive procedure, which poses risk to patients. The aim 
of the study was to develop a non-invasive methodology for determining mean-CVP 
from ultrasound assessment of the jugular venous pulse.
METHODS: In thirty-four adult patients (age = 60 Â± 12 years; 10 males), CVP was 
measured using a central venous catheter, with internal jugular vein (IJV) 
cross-sectional area (CSA) variation along the cardiac beat acquired using 
ultrasound. The resultant CVP and IJV-CSA signals were synchronized with 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals acquired from the patients. Autocorrelation 
signals were derived from the IJV-CSA signals using algorithms in R (open-source 
statistical software). The correlation r-values for successive lag intervals 
were extracted and used to build a linear regression model in which mean-CVP was 
the response variable and the lagging autocorrelation r-values and mean IJV-CSA, 
were the predictor variables. The optimum model was identified using the minimum 
AIC value and validated using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: While the CVP and IJV-CSA signals were poorly correlated (mean r = 
-0.018, SD = 0.357) due to the IJV-CSA signal lagging behind the CVP signal, 
their autocorrelation counterparts were highly positively correlated (mean r = 
0.725, SD = 0.215). Using the lagging autocorrelation r-values as predictors, 
mean-CVP was predicted with reasonable accuracy (r2 = 0.612), with a 
mean-absolute-error of 1.455 cmH2O, which rose to 2.436 cmH2O when 
cross-validation was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Mean-CVP can be estimated non-invasively by using the lagged 
autocorrelation r-values of the IJV-CSA signal. This new methodology may have 
considerable potential as a clinical monitoring and diagnostic tool.
