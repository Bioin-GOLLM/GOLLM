BACKGROUND: Targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) is increasingly used in 
oncology for therapeutic decision-making, but is not yet widely used for 
prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to determine current clinical 
utility of tNGS for prostate cancer management.
METHODS: Seven academic genitourinary medical oncologists recruited and 
consented patients with prostate cancer, largely with unusual clinical and/or 
pathologic features, from 2013 to 2015. UW-OncoPlex was performed on 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumors and/or metastatic 
biopsies. Results were discussed at a multidisciplinary precision tumor board 
prior to communicating to patients. FFPE tumor DNA was extracted for tNGS 
analysis of 194 cancer-associated genes. Results, multidisciplinary discussion, 
and treatment changes were recorded.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients consented and 42 had reportable results. Findings 
included mutations in genes frequently observed in prostate cancer. We also 
found alterations in genes where targeted treatments were available and/or in 
clinical trials. 4/42 (10%) cases, change in treatment directly resulted from 
tNGS and multidisciplinary discussion. In 30/42 (71%) cases additional options 
were available but not pursued and/or were pending. Notably, 10/42 (24%) of 
patients harbored suspected germline mutations in moderate or high-penetrance 
cancer risk genes, including BRCA2, TP53, ATM, and CHEK2. One patient's tumor 
had bi-allelic MSH6 mutation and microsatellite instability. In total, 34/42 
(81%) cases resulted in some measure of treatment actionability. Limitations 
include small size and limited clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeted NGS tumor sequencing may help guide immediate and future 
treatment options for men with prostate cancer. A substantial subset had 
germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes with potential clinical 
management implications for men and their relatives. Prostate 76:1303-1311,
