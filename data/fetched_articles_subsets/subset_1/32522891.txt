Nuclear receptor-related 1 (Nurr1) protein has been identified as an obligatory 
transcription factor in midbrain dopaminergic neurogenesis, but the global set 
of human NURR1 target genes remains unexplored. Here, we identified direct gene 
targets of NURR1 by analyzing genome-wide differential expression of NURR1 
together with NURR1 consensus sites in three human neural stem cell (hNSC) 
lines. Microarray data were validated by quantitative PCR in hNSCs and mouse 
embryonic brains and through comparison to published human data, including 
genome-wide association study hits and the BioGPS gene expression atlas. Our 
analysis identified ~40 NURR1 direct target genes, many of them involved in 
essential protein modules such as synapse formation, neuronal cell migration 
during brain development, and cell cycle progression and DNA replication. 
Specifically, expression of genes related to synapse formation and neuronal cell 
migration correlated tightly with NURR1 expression, whereas cell cycle 
progression correlated negatively with it, precisely recapitulating midbrain 
dopaminergic development. Overall, this systematic examination of 
NURR1-controlled regulatory networks provides important insights into this 
protein's biological functions in dopamine-based neurogenesis.
