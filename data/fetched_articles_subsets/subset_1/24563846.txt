The brain has a central role in the regulation of energy stability of the 
organism. It is the organ with the highest energetic demands, the most 
susceptible to energy deficits, and is responsible for coordinating behavioral 
and physiological responses related to food foraging and intake. Dietary 
interventions have been shown to be a very effective means to extend lifespan 
and delay the appearance of age-related pathological conditions, notably those 
associated with brain functional decline. The present review focuses on the 
effects of these interventions on brain metabolism and cerebral redox state, and 
summarizes the current literature dealing with dietary interventions on brain 
pathology.
