The regiospecific Mannich aminomethylation of 7-hydroxyisoflavonoids using 
bis(N,N-dimethylamino)methane afforded C-8 substituted N,N-dimethylaminomethyl 
adducts, and the regioselective aminomethylation of 
5-hydroxy-7-methoxyisoflavonoids afforded predominantly the C-6 substituted 
N,N-dimethylaminomethyl adducts. Acetylation of these C-6 or C-8 Mannich bases 
with potassium acetate in acetic anhydride provided access to the corresponding 
acetoxymethyl derivatives that were subsequently converted to hydroxymethyl- and 
methoxymethyl-substituted 5-hydroxy- or 7-hydroxyisoflavonoids related to 
naturally occurring flavonoids. The C-8 acetoxymethyl, hydroxymethyl or 
methoxymethyl-substituted isoflavonoids possessed promising inhibitory potency 
in the low micromolar range in a prostate cancer PC-3 cell proliferation assay.
