Phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase gamma (PI3Kγ) is expressed in all the cell types 
that are involved in airway inflammation and disease, including not only 
leukocytes, but also structural cells, where it is expressed at very low levels 
under physiological conditions, while is significantly upregulated after stress. 
In the airways, PI3Kγ behaves as a trigger or a controller, depending on the 
pathological context. In this review, the contribution of PI3Kγ in a plethora of 
respiratory diseases, spanning from acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, 
asthma, cystic fibrosis and response to both bacterial and viral pathogens, will 
be commented.
