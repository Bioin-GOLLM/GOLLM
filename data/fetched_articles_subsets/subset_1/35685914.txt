BACKGROUND: Mutations in the KMT2C gene can cause Kleefstra syndrome-2 (KLEFS2).
CASE: In this study, we analyzed the clinical, genetic testing, and 10-year 
follow-up data of a child with KLEFS2 treated at the Child Healthcare 
Department, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing. The case 
of KLEFS2 presented feeding difficulty and developmental delay, both intervened 
by nutritional support and family rehabilitation. Obvious attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurred in preschool and school-age children and 
was managed by behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions.
CONCLUSION: Features of KLEFS2 include feeding difficulty and developmental 
delays in an early age, as well as ADHD in preschool and school age. 
Satisfactory outcomes are not achieved in early nutritional support for 
correcting malnutrition and pharmaceutical intervention for relieving ADHD, but 
both measures can counter developmental delay.
