Because the vaccine-elicited antibody and neutralizing activity against spike 
protein of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with protection from COVID-19, it is 
important to determine the levels of specific IgG and neutralization titers 
against SARS-CoV-2 elicited by the vaccines. While three widely used vaccine 
brands (Pfizer-BNT162b2, Moderna-mRNA-1273 and Johnson-Ad26.COV2.S) are 
effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and alleviating COVID-19 illness, 
they have different efficacy against COVID-19. It is unclear whether the 
differences are due to varying ability of the vaccines to elicit a specific IgG 
antibody response and neutralization activity against spike protein of the 
virus. In this study, we compared the plasma IgG and neutralization titers 
against spike proteins of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and eight variants in healthy 
subjects who received the mRNA-1273, BNT162b2 or Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. We 
demonstrated that subjects vaccinated with Ad26.COV2.S vaccine had significantly 
lower levels of IgG and neutralizing titers as compared to those who received 
the mRNA vaccines. While the linear regression analysis showed a positive 
correlation between IgG levels and neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 WT 
and the variants, there was an overall reduction in neutralizing titers against 
the variants in subjects across the three groups. These findings suggest that 
people who received one dose of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine have a more limited IgG 
response and lower neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 WT and its 
variants than recipients of the mRNA vaccines. Thus, monitoring the plasma or 
serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titer and neutralization activity is 
necessary for the selection of suitable vaccines, vaccine dosage and regimens.
