Idiopathic congenital nystagmus (ICN) is a genetically heterogeneous eye 
movement disorder which seriously reduces childhood visual acuity. X-linked 
inheritance is the most common pattern, and mutations in FERM domain-containing 
protein 7 (FRMD7) are the major cause. Here, we recruited a four-generation 
Chinese family with X-linked ICN for the causative mutational screening of 
FRMD7. A novel missense variant, c.805 A > C, was identified in the proband. The 
mutation was confirmed in all the affected individuals but was not detected in 
unaffected family members or 100 unrelated Chinese male controls. The mutation 
causes a substitution of lysine to glutamine at position 269 (p.Lys269Gln, 
K269Q). The FRMD7 mutant inhibits the formation and extension of neurites. 
Moreover, the mutation disrupts FRMD7 interaction with 
calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase and neurite formation. 
Together, our data expand the mutation spectrum of FRMD7 causing ICN and provide 
an insight into the pathogenesis of nystagmus.
