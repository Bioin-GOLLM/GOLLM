MPS VI (mucopolysaccharidosis type VI) is a lysosomal storage disease in which 
deficient activity of the enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase [ASB 
(arylsulfatase B)] impairs the stepwise degradation of the GAG 
(glycosaminoglycan) dermatan sulfate. Clinical studies of ERT (enzyme 
replacement therapy) by using rhASB (recombinant human ASB) have been reported 
with promising results. The release of GAG into the urine is currently used as a 
biomarker of disease, reflecting in some cases disease severity and in all cases 
therapeutic responsiveness. Using RNA studies in four Italian patients 
undergoing ERT, we observed that TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) might 
be a biomarker for MPS VI responsive to therapy. In addition to its role as a 
potential biomarker, TNFalpha expression could provide insights into the 
possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the mucopolysaccharidoses.
