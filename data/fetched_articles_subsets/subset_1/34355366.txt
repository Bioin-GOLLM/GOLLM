OBJECTIVE: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) is a heterogeneous group of 
genetic disorders characterized by progressive weakness of pelvic and shoulder 
girdle muscles. The objective is to characterize the phenotypic, pathological, 
radiological, and genetic findings in LGMD2A phenotype (Calpainopathies).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The National Saudi Arabian LGMD cohort database was 
screened for LGMD from January 2000 to January 2021. A descriptive 
cross-sectional study was done on a total of 112 families with LGMD. Screening 
for mutation in Calpain (CAPN3) gene was done. Clinical and genetic features of 
LGMD2A phenotype were the main outcome variables. Epi-info was used for 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: 34 subjects from 22 families (19.64%) had the specific LMGD2A 
phenotype. The mean age of onset was 9.9 Â± 4.5 years (Range 4 to 19 years). The 
major initial symptoms were lower limb weakness, inability to climb stairs, and 
gait disturbance. Gower's sign occurred on an average of 3.75 to 7.25 years 
after onset. Loss of ambulation was observed in 55.8%. Two novel mutations in 
the CAPN3 gene were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LGMD2A was 19.64% among the national Saudi 
Arabian LGMD cohort. The clinical presentation was varied and was consistent 
with other reports from different ethnic groups.
