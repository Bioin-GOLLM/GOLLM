Since the pioneering discovery of the rapid CNS depressant actions of steroids 
by the "father of stress," Hans Seyle 70â€‰years ago, brain-derived 
"neurosteroids" have emerged as powerful endogenous modulators of neuronal 
excitability. The majority of the intervening research has focused on a class of 
naturally occurring steroids that are metabolites of progesterone and 
deoxycorticosterone, which act in a non-genomic manner to selectively augment 
signals mediated by the main inhibitory receptor in the CNS, the GABA(A) 
receptor. Abnormal levels of such neurosteroids associate with a variety of 
neurological and psychiatric disorders, suggesting that they serve important 
physiological and pathophysiological roles. A compelling case can be made to 
implicate neurosteroids in stress-related disturbances. Here we will critically 
appraise how brain-derived neurosteroids may impact on the stress response to 
acute and chronic challenges, both pre- and postnatally through to adulthood. 
The pathological implications of such actions in the development of psychiatric 
disturbances will be discussed, with an emphasis on the therapeutic potential of 
neurosteroids for the treatment of stress-associated disorders.
