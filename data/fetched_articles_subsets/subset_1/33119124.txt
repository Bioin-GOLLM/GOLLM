BACKGROUND: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) 
gene have been linked with the risk of oral carcinoma (OC) in a relatively small 
sample size. Our study aims to investigate the pooled associations by conducting 
a meta-analysis of published studies.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched to 
identify eligible studies published in English before October 2019. The odds 
ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess association. 
The publication bias was detected by Begg's test. Sensitivity and cumulative 
analyses were performed to evaluate the stability of crude results.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis involved eight studies. Significant associations were 
certified between IL-10 gene -1082A/G polymorphism and susceptibility of OC for 
A vs. G (OR=1.817, 95% CI: 1.481-2.230), AA vs. GG (OR=3.436, 95% CI: 
2.281-5.175), dominant genetic model (OR=2.913, 95% CI: 1.939-4.376), and 
recessive genetic model (OR=1.886, 95% CI: 1.372-2.594) in overall population, 
East Asians and South Asians. In addition, the significant association between 
-592A/C polymorphism of the gene and susceptibility of OC were detected in South 
Asians.
CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis results support that the IL-10 gene -1082G allele 
is a risk factor for OC in East Asians and South Asians, and IL-10 gene -592C 
allele is a protective factor for the disease.
