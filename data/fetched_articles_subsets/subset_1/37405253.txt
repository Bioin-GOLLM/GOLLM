Moving a new drug from bench to bedside is a long and arduous process. The 
tactic of drug repurposing, which solves "new" diseases with "old" existing 
drugs, is more efficient and economical than conventional ab-initio way for drug 
development. Information technology has dramatically changed the paradigm of 
biomedical research in the new century, and drug repurposing studies have been 
significantly accelerated by implementing informatics techniques related to 
genomics, systems biology and biophysics during the past few years. A series of 
remarkable achievements in this field comes with the practical applications of 
in silico approaches including transcriptomic signature matching, 
gene-connection-based scanning, and simulated structure docking in repositioning 
drug therapies against breast cancer. In this review, we systematically curated 
these impressive accomplishments with summarization of the main findings on 
potentially repurposable drugs, and provide our insights into the current issues 
as well as future directions of the field. With the prospective improvement in 
reliability, the computer-assisted repurposing strategy will play a more 
critical role in drug research and development.
