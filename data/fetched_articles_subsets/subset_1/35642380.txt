PURPOSE: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an uncommon chronic and occlusive 
cerebrovascular disorder involving the development of abnormal collateral 
vessels. This report aimed to describe a Chinese familial case with a rare 
variant in the RNF213 gene.
METHODS: The present report presents a rare familial case of MMD involving a 
heterozygous c.14429G>A variant in RNF213 and exhibiting different phenotypes.
RESULTS: A 3-year-old Chinese boy and his 10-year-old sister diagnosed severe 
bilateral MMD, while their mother was diagnosed asymptomatic bilateral MMD, 
based on the imaging results of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The boy 
mainly showed numbness at left hand accompanied by dysphasia and dyskinesia, 
while his sister had complex symptoms including dysphasia, dyskinesia at both 
hands and fatigue of limbs. Muscle force was ranked as left (upper limb/lower 
limb: 4/3) and right (upper limb/lower limb: 3/4). Genetic testing indicated a 
heterozygous c.14429G>A variant in RNF213 in 3 patients. The 3 patients shared 
the same amino acid substitution of p.Arg4810Lys caused by c.14429G>A. The 
father of two children also underwent genetic testing for RNF213 and MRI 
examination but found normal in all indices.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing for RNF213 is suggested for MMD screening towards 
family members, and c.14576G>A variant is identified as an important pathogenic 
mutation with family heritability.
