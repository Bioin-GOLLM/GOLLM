X-linked recessive chondrodysplasia punctata (CDPX1) is a rare congenital 
disorder of bone and cartilage development, characterized by punctate 
calcification in areas of endochondral bone formation, leading to stippled 
epiphyses, severe nasal and midfacial hypoplasia, short stature, and 
brachytelephalangy. CDPX1 is caused by mutations in the arylsulfatase E (ARSE) 
gene located on chromosome Xp22.3. Although most affected males have milder 
symptoms, some have significant medical problems including respiratory 
compromise and cervical spinal stenosis due to dysplastic vertebrae. Herein, we 
present the case of a male infant with the characteristic features of CDPX1 and 
severe spinal cord compression. Direct sequencing analysis revealed a novel 
variation (c.430G>A) in the ARSE gene that was thought to be a missense mutation 
(p.Gly144Arg), but proved to be a novel splicing mutation (r.[430g>a; 
430_431ins430+1_430+21) adding seven amino acids between p.Ile143 and p.Gly144 
(p.Ile143_Gly-144insSerMetTyrValPheLysSer). This report expands the spectrum of 
mutations of the ARSE gene and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first 
clinically and genetically confirmed case of CDPX1 with severe spinal cord 
compression in Korea.
