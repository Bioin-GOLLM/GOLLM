BACKGROUND: There has been much interest recently in the effects of various 
cytokine gene expression polymorphisms on graft outcome. However, the results of 
these investigations reveal the outcomes to be organ-specific and 
center-specific. We sought to confirm and add to some of the earlier findings by 
studying the impact of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-10 
(IL-10), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) polymorphisms 
and the interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha-chain variant on posttransplant 
renal allograft outcome.
METHOD: TNF-alpha, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 gene promoter region polymorphisms 
were assayed genotypically by PCR-SSP on 120 patients transplanted at the Albany 
Medical Center. These patients were also typed for the IL-4 receptor alpha-chain 
variant Q576R.
RESULTS: Producers of high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha were 
found to be at increased risk for acute rejection episodes if the allograft was 
mismatched for the molecular products of the class II region of the human major 
histocompatibility complex (HLA-DR). Expression level polymorphisms of the IL-6, 
IFN-gamma, and IL-10 genes were not associated with acute rejection episodes, 
nor was the IL-4 receptor alpha-chain variant Q576R.
CONCLUSIONS: These data would suggest that the production of high levels of the 
cytokine TNF-alpha is especially detrimental to graft survival when the 
recipient's T-helper lymphocytes are being activated by mismatched donor 
HLA-class II antigens. Typing all potential kidney recipients for TNF-alpha, and 
providing well-matched organs for high producers of this cytokines, may be 
expected to increase rejection-free graft survival in these patients.
