Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) constitute a set of heterogeneous 
neurodevelopmental conditions, characterized by a wide genetic variability that 
has led to hypothesize a polygenic origin. The metabolic profiles of patients 
with ASD suggest a possible implication of mitochondrial pathways. Although 
different physiological and biochemical studies reported deficits in 
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in subjects with ASD, the role of 
mitochondrial DNA variations has remained relatively unexplored. In this review, 
we report and discuss very recent evidence to demonstrate the key role of 
mitochondrial disorders in the development of ASD.
