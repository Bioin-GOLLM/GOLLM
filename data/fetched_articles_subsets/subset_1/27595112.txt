We tested the hypothesis that a high fat meal (HFM) would impair cutaneous 
vasodilation, while thermotherapy (TT) would reverse the detrimental effects. 
Eight participants were instrumented with skin heaters and laser-Doppler (LD) 
probes and tested in three trials: control, HFM, and HFM + TT. Participants wore 
a water-perfused suit perfused with 33°C (control and HFM) or 50°C (HFM + TT) 
water. Participants consumed 1 g fat/kg body weight. Blood samples were taken at 
baseline and two hours post-HFM. Blood pressure was measured every 5-10 minutes. 
Microvascular function was assessed via skin local heating from 33°C to 39°C two 
hours after HFM. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated and 
normalized to maximal vasodilation (%CVCmax). HFM had no effect on initial peak 
(48 ± 4 %CVCmax) compared to control (49 ± 4 %CVCmax) but attenuated the plateau 
(51 ± 4 %CVCmax) compared to control (63 ± 4 %CVCmax, P < 0.001). Initial peak 
was augmented in HFM + TT (66 ± 4 %CVCmax) compared to control and HFM (P < 
0.05), while plateau (73 ± 3 % CVCmax) was augmented only compared to the HFM 
trial (P < 0.001). These data suggest that HFM negatively affects cutaneous 
vasodilation but can be minimized by TT.
