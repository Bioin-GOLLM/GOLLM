Previously we used gene-editing to label endogenous EGF receptor (EGFR) with GFP 
and demonstrate that picomolar concentrations of EGFR ligand drive signaling and 
endocytosis of EGFR in tumors in vivo (Pinilla-Macua et al., 2017). We now use 
gene-editing to insert a fluorogen activating protein (FAP) in the EGFR 
extracellular domain. Binding of the tandem dye pair MG-Bis-SA to FAP-EGFR 
provides a ratiometric pH-sensitive model with dual fluorescence excitation and 
a single far-red emission. The excitation ratio of fluorescence intensities was 
demonstrated to faithfully report the fraction of FAP-EGFR located in acidic 
endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Coupling native FAP-EGFR expression with the 
high method sensitivity has allowed development of a high-throughput assay to 
measure the rates of clathrin-mediated FAP-EGFR endocytosis stimulated with 
physiological EGF concentrations. The assay was utilized to screen a phosphatase 
siRNA library. These studies highlight the utility of endogenous pH-sensitive 
FAP-receptor chimeras in high-throughput analysis of endocytosis.
