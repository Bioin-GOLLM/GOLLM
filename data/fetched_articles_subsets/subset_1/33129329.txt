BACKGROUND: The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) tumor suppressor gene 
is frequently lost in a variety of solid and hematopoietic malignancies in 
humans. Dysregulation of WWOX has been implicated as playing a key role in tumor 
cell survival, DNA damage repair, and genomic stability. The purpose of this 
study was to characterize WWOX expression in spontaneous canine mast cell tumors 
(MCTs) and malignant cell lines and investigate the potential contribution of 
WWOX loss on malignant mast cell behavior.
METHODS/RESULTS: WWOX expression is decreased in primary canine MCTs and 
malignant mast cell lines compared to normal canine bone marrow-cultured mast 
cells. In transformed canine mastocytoma cell lines, overexpression of WWOX or 
WWOX knockdown had no effect on mast cell viability. Inhibition of WWOX enhanced 
clonogenic survival following treatment with ionizing radiation in the C2 mast 
cell line. Lastly, immunohistochemistry for WWOX was performed using a canine 
MCT tissue microarray, demonstrating that WWOX staining intensity and percent of 
cells staining for WWOX is decreased in high-grade MCTs compared to low-grade 
MCTs.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that WWOX expression is attenuated or lost in 
primary canine MCTs and malignant mast cell lines. Given the observed increase 
in clonogenic survival in WWOX-deficient C2 mast cells treated with ionizing 
radiation, further investigation of WWOX and its role in mediating the DNA 
damage response in malignant mast cells is warranted.
