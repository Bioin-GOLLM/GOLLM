Structure-based design of vaccines, particularly the iterative optimization used 
so successfully in the structure-based design of drugs, has been a long-sought 
goal. We previously developed a first-generation vaccine antigen called DS-Cav1, 
comprising a prefusion-stabilized form of the fusion (F) glycoprotein, which 
elicits high-titer protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) in mice and macaques. Here we report the improvement of DS-Cav1 through 
iterative cycles of structure-based design that significantly increased the 
titer of RSV-protective responses. The resultant second-generation 
'DS2'-stabilized immunogens have their F subunits genetically linked, their 
fusion peptides deleted and their interprotomer movements stabilized by an 
additional disulfide bond. These DS2 immunogens are promising vaccine candidates 
with superior attributes, such as their lack of a requirement for furin cleavage 
and their increased antigenic stability against heat inactivation. The iterative 
structure-based improvement described here may have utility in the optimization 
of other vaccine antigens.
