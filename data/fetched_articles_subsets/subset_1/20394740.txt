OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to assess the association of common 
sequence variants, and selected interactions, with HDL-c plasma levels.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We analysed 743 individuals (340 men and 403 women) with 
high mean triglyceride and LDL-c levels. The association of five polymorphic 
sites (ABCA1 g.1051G>A, APOA1 g.-75G>A, CETP g.-629C>A, HNF1A g.102A>C, and LIPG 
g.584C>T), apoE isoforms and selected interactions with HDL-c levels were 
evaluated using linear regression models.
RESULTS: After adjusting for triglycerides, sex, and BMI the only genotype with 
a statistically significant effect on HDL-c levels (p-value=0.004) was the CETP 
promoter variant. Further, linear regression model with interactions included 
indicated possible interplay between APOA1 genotype and menopause 
(p-value=0.002) and ABCA1 and APOE isoforms (p-value=0.017) on HDL-c plasma 
concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that not only the CETP variant but also apoE 
isoforms and menopause could operate as potent modulators of HDL-c 
concentrations.
