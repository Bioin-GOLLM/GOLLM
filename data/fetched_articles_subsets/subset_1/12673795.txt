Molecular defects affecting the ATRX gene lead to the ATRX syndrome (alpha 
thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, X-linked), characterized by severe 
mental retardation, microcephaly, distinct facial dysmorphism, and genital 
abnormalities, as well as a wide spectrum of other pathological features. Alpha 
thalassemia is frequent but does not represent a constant characteristic of the 
syndrome. An expanding phenotype of the ATRX gene (a RAD54 homologue encoding a 
putative zinc-finger helicase) has been demonstrated as a result of the 
association of single mutations with specific X-linked mental retardation 
syndromes. To date, mutational analysis of the gene has been based on direct DNA 
sequencing or using methods with a lower detection rate. In this paper, we 
present a broad-range DGGE method for single-step mutation scanning of the 
entire open reading frame (ORF) and canonical splice sites of the gene. Using 
this method, we successfully identified five novel sequence changes in the ATRX 
gene, including four missense mutations (K1733E, R2085C, D2136N, T2169A) and one 
polymorphism (IVS5+35G>A).
