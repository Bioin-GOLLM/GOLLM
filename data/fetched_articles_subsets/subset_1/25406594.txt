Tethering factors regulate the targeting of membrane-enclosed vesicles under the 
control of Rab GTPases. p115, a golgin family tether, has been shown to 
participate in multiple stages of ER/Golgi transport. Despite extensive study, 
the mechanism of action of p115 is poorly understood. SNARE proteins make up the 
machinery for membrane fusion, and strong evidence shows that function of p115 
is directly linked to its interaction with SNAREs. Using a gel filtration 
binding assay, we have demonstrated that in solution p115 stably interacts with 
ER/Golgi SNAREs rbet1 and sec22b, but not membrin and syntaxin 5. These binding 
preferences stemmed from selectivity of p115 for monomeric SNARE motifs as 
opposed to SNARE oligomers. Soluble monomeric rbet1 can compete off p115 from 
coat protein II (COPII) vesicles. Furthermore, excess p115 inhibits p115 
function in trafficking. We conclude that monomeric SNAREs are a major binding 
site for p115 on COPII vesicles, and that p115 dissociates from its SNARE 
partners upon SNAREpin assembly. Our results suggest a model in which p115 forms 
a mixed p115/SNARE helix bundle with a monomeric SNARE, facilitates the binding 
activity and/or concentration of the SNARE at prefusion sites and is 
subsequently ejected as SNARE complex formation and fusion proceed.
