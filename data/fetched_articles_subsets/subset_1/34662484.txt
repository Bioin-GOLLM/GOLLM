CONTEXT: A negative association between a history of allergy and childhood acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been reported in previous studies, but remains 
debated. This work aimed to investigate this association accounting for genetic 
polymorphisms of the Th2 pathway cytokines (IL4, IL10, IL13, and IL4R).
METHODS: Analyses were based on the French case-control study ESTELLE 
(2010-2011). The complete sample included 629 ALL cases and 1421 
population-based controls frequency-matched on age and gender. The child's 
medical history was collected through standardized maternal interview. 
Biological samples were collected, and genotyping data were available for 411 
cases and 704 controls of European origin. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using 
unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders.
RESULTS: In the complete sample, a significant inverse association was observed 
between ALL and reported history of allergic rhinitis or sinusitis (OR = 0.65 
[0.42-0.98]; P = 0.04), but there was no obvious association with allergies 
overall. There was an interaction between genetic polymorphisms in IL4 and IL4R 
(Pinteraction = 0.003), as well as a gene-environment interaction between 
IL4R-rs1801275 and a reported history of asthma (IOR = 0.23; Pint  = 0.008) and 
eczema (IOR = 0.47; Pint  = 0.06). We observed no interaction with the candidate 
polymorphisms in IL4 and IL13.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the association between allergic symptoms 
and childhood ALL could be modified by IL4R-rs1801275, and that this variant 
could also interact with a functional variant in IL4 gene. Although they warrant 
confirmation, these results could help understand the pathological mechanisms 
under the reported inverse association between allergy and childhood ALL.
