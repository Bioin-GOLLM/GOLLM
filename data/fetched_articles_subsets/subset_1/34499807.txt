Nucleoli are well defined for their function in ribosome biogenesis, but only a 
small fraction of the nucleolar proteome has been characterized. Here, we report 
that the proto-oncogene, c-Jun, is targeted to the nucleolus. Using live cell 
imaging in myogenic cells, we document that the c-Jun basic domain contains a 
unique, evolutionarily conserved motif that determines nucleolar targeting. Fos 
family Jun dimer partners, such as Fra2, while nuclear, do not co-localize with 
c-Jun in the nucleolus. A point mutation in c-Jun that mimics Fra2 (M260E) in 
its Nucleolar Localization sequence (NoLS) results in loss of c-Jun nucleolar 
targeting while still preserving nuclear localization. Fra2 can sequester c-Jun 
in the nucleoplasm, indicating that the stoichiometric ratio of heterodimeric 
partners regulates c-Jun nucleolar targeting. Finally, nucleolar localization of 
c-Jun modulates nucleolar architecture and ribosomal RNA accumulation. These 
studies highlight a novel role for Jun family proteins in the nucleolus, having 
potential implications for a diverse array of AP-1-regulated cellular processes.
