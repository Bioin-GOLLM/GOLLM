The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is an old system with new 
fundamental roles in cancer biology which influences cell growth, migration, 
death, and metastasis. RAAS signaling enhances cell proliferation in malignancy 
directly and indirectly by affecting tumor cells and modulating angiogenesis. 
Cancer development may be influenced by the balance between the ACE/Ang II/AT1R 
and the ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas receptor pathways. The interactions between Ang II/AT1R 
and Ang I/AT2R as well as Ang1-7/Mas and alamandine/MrgD receptors in the RAAS 
pathway can significantly impact the development of cancer. Ang I/AT2R, 
Ang1-7/Mas, and alamandine/MrgD interactions can have anticancer effects while 
Ang II/AT1R interactions can be involved in the development of cancer. Evidence 
suggests that inhibitors of the RAAS, which are conventionally used to treat 
cardiovascular diseases, may be beneficial in cancer therapies.Herein, we aim to 
provide a thorough description of the elements of RAAS and their molecular play 
in cancer. Alongside this, the role of RAAS components in sex-dependent cancers 
as well as GI cancers will be discussed with the hope of enlightening new venues 
for adjuvant cancer treatment.
