Malignant melanoma is considered the most lethal skin cancer if it is not 
detected and treated during its early stages. About 10% of melanoma patients 
report a family history of melanoma; however, individuals with features of true 
hereditary melanoma (ie, unilateral lineage, multigenerational, multiple primary 
lesions, and early onset of disease) are in fact quite rare. Although many new 
loci have been implicated in hereditary melanoma, CDKN2A mutations remain the 
most common. Familial melanoma in the presence of multiple atypical nevi should 
raise suspicion for a germline CDKN2A mutation. These patients have a high risk 
of developing multiple primary melanomas and internal organ malignancies, 
especially pancreatic cancer; therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is 
necessary in many cases. The value of dermoscopic examination and total body 
photography performed at regular intervals has been suggested by a number of 
studies, and should therefore be considered for these patients and their 
first-degree relatives. In addition, genetic counseling with the possibility of 
testing can be a valuable adjunct for familial melanoma patients. This must be 
performed with care, however, and only by qualified individuals trained in 
cancer risk analysis.
