BACKGROUND: Early repolarization (ER) is associated with an increased risk for 
death from cardiac causes. Recent evidence supports ER's role as a modifier 
and/or predictor of risk in many cardiac conditions.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of ER among 
genotype-positive patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) and evaluate its utility 
in predicting the risk of symptoms.
METHODS: ER was defined as QRS slurring and/or notching associated with ≥1-mV 
QRS-ST junction (J-point) elevation in at least 2 contiguous leads, excluding 
the anterior precordial leads. The ECG with the most prominent ER was used for 
analysis. Major ER was defined as ≥ 2-mm J-point elevation. Symptoms of LQTS 
included cardiac syncope, documented polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), 
and resuscitated cardiac arrest.
RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients (mean age 41 ± 19 years; 63 female) were 
reviewed, among whom 414 (mean 3.7 ± 1.5) ECGs were analyzed. Of these, 30 
patients (27%) with a history of symptoms. Fifty patients (44%) had ER, and 19 
patients (17%) had major ER. Patients with major ER were not different from 
patients without major ER with respect to age, sex, long QT type, longest QTc 
recorded, number of patients with QTc >500 ms, or use of beta-blockade. 
Univariate and independent predictors of symptom status included the presence of 
major ER, longest QTc recorded >500 ms, and female sex.
CONCLUSION: ER ≥2 mm was the strongest independent predictor of symptom status 
related to LQTS, along with female sex and QTc >500 ms.
