BACKGROUND: PRL-3 is a member of phosphatases of regenerating liver family, 
characterized by phosphatase active domain and C-terminal prenylation motif. 
Overexpression of PRL-3 has been implicated in multiple cancers. Here we 
examined the clinical significance of PRL-3 in gastric cancer together with its 
metastatic biological functions utilizing different structural mutants.
METHODS: PRL-3 expression was analyzed immunohistochemically in 196 gastric 
cancer patients and 21 cases of liver metastasis. A series of wild type PRL-3 or 
its mutant plasmids were expressed in BGC823 cells to investigate the 
relationship between its catalytic activity, cellular localization and 
metastatic potential in vitro.
RESULTS: Positive staining of PRL-3 was observed in 19.4% (38/196) gastric 
cancer tissues compared with 76.2% (16/21) in liver metastasis. Statistical 
analysis revealed that PRL-3 expression correlated with lymph node metastasis 
and vascular invasion (P<0.05). Patients with high PRL-3 expression showed 
poorer 5-year overall survival (P=0.011). Wild type PRL-3 expressing cells 
resulted in enhanced migration and invasion ability, which were greatly crippled 
in form of PRL-3(C104S) or PRL-3(Î”CAAX) mutants accompanied with its alteration 
in subcellular localization.
CONCLUSIONS: Metastasis associated protein PRL-3 may serve as a potential 
prognostic biomarker in human gastric cancer. Both the phosphatase catalytic 
activity and cellular localization are critical for its function.
