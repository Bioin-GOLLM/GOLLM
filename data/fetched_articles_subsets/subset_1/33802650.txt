As an essential modulator of IgG disposition, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) 
governs the pharmacokinetics and functions many therapeutic modalities. In this 
review, we thoroughly reexamine the hitherto elucidated biological and 
thermodynamic properties of FcRn to provide context for our assessment of more 
recent advances, which covers antigen-binding fragment (Fab) determinants of 
FcRn affinity, transgenic preclinical models, and FcRn targeting as an 
immune-complex (IC)-clearing strategy. We further comment on therapeutic 
antibodies authorized for treating SARS-CoV-2 (bamlanivimab, casirivimab, and 
imdevimab) and evaluate their potential to saturate FcRn-mediated recycling. 
Finally, we discuss modeling and simulation studies that probe the quantitative 
relationship between in vivo IgG persistence and in vitro FcRn binding, 
emphasizing the importance of endosomal transit parameters.
