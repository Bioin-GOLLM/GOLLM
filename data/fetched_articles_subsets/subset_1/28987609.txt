Mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a major driver of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The EGFRT790M secondary mutation has become a leading 
cause of clinically-acquired resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib. Herein, we 
present a structure-based design approach to increase the potency and 
selectivity of the previously reported reversible EGFR inhibitor 7, at the 
kinase and cellular levels. Three-step structure-activity relationship 
exploration led to promising compounds 19e and 19h with unique chemical 
structure and binding mode from the other third-generation tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. In a human NSCLC xenograft model, 19e and 19h exhibited 
dose-dependent tumor growth suppression without toxicity. These selective 
inhibitors are promising drug candidates for EGFRT790M-driven NSCLC.
