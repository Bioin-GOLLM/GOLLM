The presence of a patent foramen ovale has been found to be associated with an 
increased risk of ischemic stroke of otherwise unknown origin (cryptogenic 
stroke). The present article will review the evidence regarding this 
association, the technical aspects of PFO detection, and the preventive options 
to decrease the risk of recurrent cerebral events.
