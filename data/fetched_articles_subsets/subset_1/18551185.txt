The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the 
nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. These receptors are also ligand-dependent 
transcription factors responsible for the regulation of cellular events that 
range from glucose and lipid homeostases to cell differentiation and apoptosis. 
The importance of these receptors in lipid homeostasis and energy balance is 
well established. In addition to these metabolic and anti-inflammatory 
properties, emerging evidence indicates that PPARs can function as either tumor 
suppressors or accelerators, suggesting that these receptors are potential 
candidates as drug targets for cancer prevention and treatment. However, 
conflicting results have emerged regarding the role of PPARs on colon 
carcinogenesis. Therefore, further investigation is warranted prior to 
considering modulation of PPARs as an efficacious therapy for colorectal cancer 
chemoprevention and treatment.
