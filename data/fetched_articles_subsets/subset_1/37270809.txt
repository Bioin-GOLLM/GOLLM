BACKGROUND: Depending on the therapy approach and disease background, the 
heterogeneity of muscular tissues complicates the development of targeted gene 
therapy, where either expression in all muscle types or restriction to only one 
muscle type is warranted. Muscle specificity can be achieved using promotors 
mediating tissue specific and sustained physiological expression in the desired 
muscle types but limited activity in non-targeted tissue. Several muscle 
specific promotors have been described, but direct comparisons between them are 
lacking.
OBJECTIVE: Here we present a direct comparison of muscle specific Desmin-, 
MHCK7, microRNA206- and Calpain3 promotor.
METHODS: To directly compare these muscle specific promotors we utilized 
transfection of reporter plasmids using an in vitro model based on electrical 
pulse stimulation (EPS) to provoke sarcomere formation in 2D cell culture for 
quantification of promotor activities in far differentiated mouse and human 
myotubes.
RESULTS: We found that Desmin- and MHCK7 promotors showed stronger reporter gene 
expression levels in proliferating and differentiated myogenic cell lines than 
miR206 and CAPN3 promotor. However, Desmin and MHCK7 promotor promoted gene 
expression also cardiac cells whereas miR206 and CAPN3 promotor expression was 
restricted to skeletal muscle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provides direct comparison of muscle specific promotors 
with regard to expression strengths and specificity as this is important feature 
to avoid undesired transgene expression in non-target muscle cells for a desired 
therapy approach.
