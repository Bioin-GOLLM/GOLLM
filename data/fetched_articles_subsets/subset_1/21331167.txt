Trisomy 14 as a sole chromosome abnormality is associated with older age, a 
heterogenous group of myeloid neoplasms with dysplasia, and a wide spectrum of 
disease progression.

Trisomy 14 is a rare recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in myeloid neoplasms; 
however, its clinicopathologic features have not been well described. We report 
the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features of 16 
cases of myeloid neoplasms with isolated trisomy 14. Our results show that cases 
with isolated trisomy 14 encompass a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms 
including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 44%), 
myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (31%), and acute myeloid leukemia 
(25%). The patients are usually elder (median age 71 years), and there is a male 
predominance (82%). Multilineage dysplasia is noted in all cases. Oncogenic 
mutations of genes involved in cell proliferation and/or survival rarely occur. 
Compared with cases of MDS with diploid karyotype, patients of MDS with isolated 
trisomy 14 demonstrate a similar overall survival and rate of leukemia 
transformation.
