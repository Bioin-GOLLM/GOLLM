INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Increased total serum bilirubin rarely reported in 
mild COVID-19 patients. It occurs mostly in severe cases, particularly in those 
who have liver diseases and admitted to an intensive care unit. The main cause 
of increased liver biochemistries in Covid-19 patients related to used drugs, 
the presence of the ACE2 receptor in the liver, and robust inflammatory 
response. However, limited studies available regarding to jaundice in COVID19 
patients.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case of hyperbilirubinemia in a mild 
asymptomatic COVID-19 patient, the patient was diagnosed by RT-PCR three days 
prior to presentation fever, dark urine, and of acute onset of jaundice. The 
patient was diagnosed by physical examination and laboratory findings, and 
treated successfully by high-quality natural honey.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: A recent studies of COVID-19 increased total serum 
bilirubin have been reported, mostly after the appearance of the COVID-19 
symptoms. The case in the current study was a 48-year-old male patient who was 
diagnosed with mild COVID-19 three days prior to presentation. After 2 days 
increased total serum bilirubin.
CONCLUSION: Honey is a natural medicine to treat Jaundice in mild COVID-19 
patients. However, significant data on larger studies are still lacking to 
decide. Our case guides for the clinical treatment of conjunctival icterus in 
mild COVID-19 patients.
