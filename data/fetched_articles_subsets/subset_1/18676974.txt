Prion diseases are untreatable neurodegenerative disorders characterized by 
accumulation of PrP(Sc), an aggregated isoform of the cellular prion protein 
(PrP(C)). We generated a library of PrP variants with random mutations in the 
helix-3 domain and screened for dominant-negative mutants (DNMs) that would 
inhibit replication of prions (the Rocky Mountain Laboratory strain) in infected 
N2a cells. Two of the identified PrP mutants, Q167R and Q218K, were already 
known to counteract prion replication, thereby validating the effectiveness of 
this approach. In addition, novel DNMs were found efficiently to antagonize 
PrP(Sc) propagation in cells. In contrast to Q167R and Q218K, the newly 
identified DNMs S221P and Y217C resided on the cell surface at a substantially 
lower level, suggesting that robust cell surface display of DNM might not be a 
general prerequisite for efficient prion antagonism. The newly identified DNMs 
point to useful target-selective therapeutic tools for the treatment of prion 
diseases.
