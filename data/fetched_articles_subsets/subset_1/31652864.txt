The present study aimed to identify the molecular markers for genes that 
influence intramuscular fat content (IFC), but not average backfat thickness 
(ABT). A total of 330 Suhuai pigs were slaughtered, and measurements of IFC and 
ABT were obtained. Phenotypic and genetic correlations between IFC and ABT were 
calculated. Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 12 candidate 
genes for IFC were analyzed, including FABP3, LIPE, IGF1, IGF2, LEP, LEPR, MC4R, 
PHKG1, RETN, RYR1, SCD, and UBE3C. Associations of the evaluated SNPs with 
IFCIFC and ABT were performed. Our results showed that the means of IFC and ABT 
were 1.99 ± 0.03 % and 26.68 ± 0.28 mm, respectively. The coefficients of 
variation (CVs) of IFC and ABT were 31.21% and 19.36%, respectively. The 
phenotypic and genetic correlations between IFC and ABT were moderate. Only the 
FABP3 (rs1110770079) was associated with IFC (p < 0.05) but not with ABT. 
Besides, there was a tendency for associations of RYR1 (rs344435545) and SCD 
(rs80912566) with IFC (p < 0.1). Our results indicated that the FABP3 
(rs1110770079) SNP could be used as a marker to improve IFC without changing ABT 
in the Suhuai pig breeding system.
