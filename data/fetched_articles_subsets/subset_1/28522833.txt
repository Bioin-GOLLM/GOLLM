The regulatory control of cardiac endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is 
incompletely characterized. As ER stress signaling upregulates the E3-ubiquitin 
ligase Parkin, we investigated the role of Parkin in cardiac ER stress. Parkin 
knockout mice exposed to aortic constriction-induced cardiac pressure-overload 
or in response to systemic tunicamycin (TM) developed adverse ventricular 
remodeling with excessive levels of the ER regulatory C/EBP homologous protein 
CHOP. CHOP was identified as a Parkin substrate and its turnover was Parkin-dose 
and proteasome-dependent. Parkin depletion in cardiac HL-1 cells increased CHOP 
levels and enhanced susceptibility to TM-induced cell death. Parkin 
reconstitution rescued this phenotype and the contribution of excess CHOP to 
this ER stress injury was confirmed by reduction in TM-induced cell death when 
CHOP was depleted in Parkin knockdown cardiomyocytes. Isogenic Parkin mutant 
iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes showed exaggerated ER stress induced CHOP and 
apoptotic signatures and myocardium from subjects with dilated cardiomyopathy 
showed excessive Parkin and CHOP induction. This study identifies that Parkin 
functions to blunt excessive CHOP to prevent maladaptive ER stress-induced cell 
death and adverse cardiac ventricular remodeling. Additionally, Parkin is 
identified as a novel post-translational regulatory moderator of CHOP stability 
and uncovers an additional stress-modifying function of this E3-ubiquitin 
ligase.
