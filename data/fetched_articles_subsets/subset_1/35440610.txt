The common retinal diseases are age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 
retinitis pigmentosa (RP). They are usually associated with the dysfunction of 
retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and degeneration of underlying Bruch's 
membrane. The RPE cell transplantation is the most promising therapeutic option 
to restore lost vision. This study aimed to construct an ultrathin porous 
fibrous film with properties similar to that of native Bruch's membrane as 
carriers for the RPE cells. Human amniotic membrane powder 
(HAMP)/Polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds containing different concentrations of 
HAMP were fabricated by electrospinning technique. The results showed that with 
increasing the concentration of HAMP, the diameter of fibers increased. 
Moreover, hydrophilicity and degradation rate were improved from 119° to 92° and 
14 to 56% after 28 days immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, 
respectively. All scaffolds had a porosity above 85%. Proper cell adhesion was 
obtained one day after culture and no toxicity was observed. However, after 
seven days, the rate of growth and proliferation of ARPE-19 cells, a culture 
model of RPE, on the PCL-30HAMP scaffold (HAMP concentration in PCL 7.2% by 
weight) was higher compared to other scaffolds. These results indicated that 
PCL-30HAMP fibrous scaffold has a great potential to be used in retinal tissue 
engineering applications.
