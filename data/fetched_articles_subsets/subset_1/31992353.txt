BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of adult 
leukemia. Several studies have demonstrated that oncogenesis in AML is enhanced 
by kinase signaling pathways such as Src family kinases (SFK) including Src and 
Lyn, spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), and bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Recently, 
the multi-kinase inhibitor ArQule 531 (ARQ 531) has demonstrated potent 
inhibition of SFK and BTK that translated to improved pre-clinical in vivo 
activity as compared with the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) models. Given the superior activity of ARQ 531 in 
CLL, and recognition that this molecule has a broad kinase inhibition profile, 
we pursued its application in pre-clinical models of AML.
METHODS: The potency of ARQ 531 was examined in vitro using FLT3 wild type and 
mutated (ITD) AML cell lines and primary samples. The modulation of pro-survival 
kinases following ARQ 531 treatment was determined using AML cell lines. The 
effect of SYK expression on ARQ 531 potency was evaluated using a SYK 
overexpressing cell line (Ba/F3 murine cells) constitutively expressing 
FLT3-ITD. Finally, the in vivo activity of ARQ 531 was evaluated using MOLM-13 
disseminated xenograft model.
RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that ARQ 531 treatment has anti-proliferative 
activity in vitro and impairs colony formation in AML cell lines and primary AML 
cells independent of the presence of a FLT3 ITD mutation. We demonstrate 
decreased phosphorylation of oncogenic kinases targeted by ARQ 531, including 
SFK (Tyr416), BTK, and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), ultimately leading 
to changes in down-stream targets including SYK, STAT5a, and ERK1/2. Based upon 
in vitro drug synergy data, we examined ARQ 531 in the MOLM-13 AML xenograft 
model alone and in combination with venetoclax. Despite ARQ 531 having a less 
favorable pharmacokinetics profile in rodents, we demonstrate modest single 
agent in vivo activity and synergy with venetoclax.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support consideration of the application of ARQ 531 in 
combination trials for AML targeting higher drug concentrations in vivo.
