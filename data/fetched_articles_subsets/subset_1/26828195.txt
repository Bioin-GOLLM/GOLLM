Although mechanisms of acquired resistance of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR)-mutant non-small-cell lung cancers to EGFR inhibitors have been 
identified, little is known about how resistant clones evolve during drug 
therapy. Here we observe that acquired resistance caused by the EGFR(T790M) 
gatekeeper mutation can occur either by selection of pre-existing 
EGFR(T790M)-positive clones or via genetic evolution of initially 
EGFR(T790M)-negative drug-tolerant cells. The path to resistance impacts the 
biology of the resistant clone, as those that evolved from drug-tolerant cells 
had a diminished apoptotic response to third-generation EGFR inhibitors that 
target EGFR(T790M); treatment with navitoclax, an inhibitor of the 
anti-apoptotic factors BCL-xL and BCL-2 restored sensitivity. We corroborated 
these findings using cultures derived directly from EGFR inhibitor-resistant 
patient tumors. These findings provide evidence that clinically relevant 
drug-resistant cancer cells can both pre-exist and evolve from drug-tolerant 
cells, and they point to therapeutic opportunities to prevent or overcome 
resistance in the clinic.
