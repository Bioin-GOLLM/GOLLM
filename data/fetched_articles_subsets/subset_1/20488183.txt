Phosphorylation of H2AX functions to recruit DNA repair complexes to sites of 
DNA damage. Here, we report that H2AX is constitutively acetylated on lysine 36 
(H2AXK36Ac) by the CBP/p300 acetyltransferases. H2AXK36Ac is required for cells 
to survive exposure to ionizing radiation; however, H2AXK36Ac levels are not 
increased by DNA damage. Further, acetylation of H2AX did not affect 
phosphorylation of H2AX or the formation of DNA damage foci. Finally, cells with 
a double mutation in both the H2AX acetylation and phosphorylation sites were 
more radiosensitive than cells containing individual mutations. H2AXK36Ac is 
therefore a novel, constitutive histone modification located within the histone 
core region which regulates radiation sensitivity independently of H2AX 
phosphorylation.
