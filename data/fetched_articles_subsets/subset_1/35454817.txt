Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP NENs) are rare cancers 
consisting of neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 
which have been increasing in incidence in recent years. Few cell lines and 
pre-clinical models exist for studying GEP NECs and NETs, limiting the ability 
to discover novel imaging and treatment modalities. To address this gap, we 
isolated tumor cells from cryopreserved patient GEP NECs and NETs and injected 
them into the flanks of immunocompromised mice to establish patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) models. Two of six mice developed tumors (NEC913 and NEC1452). 
Over 80% of NEC913 and NEC1452 tumor cells stained positive for Ki67. NEC913 PDX 
tumors expressed neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A (CgA), 
synaptophysin (SYP), and somatostatin receptor-2 (SSTR2), whereas NEC1452 PDX 
tumors did not express SSTR2. Exome sequencing revealed loss of TP53 and RB1 in 
both NEC tumors. To demonstrate an application of these novel NEC PDX models for 
SSTR2-targeted peptide imaging, the NEC913 and NEC1452 cells were bilaterally 
injected into mice. Near infrared-labelled octreotide was administered and the 
fluorescent signal was specifically observed for the NEC913 SSTR2 positive 
tumors. These 2 GEP NEC PDX models serve as a valuable resource for GEP NEN 
therapy testing.
