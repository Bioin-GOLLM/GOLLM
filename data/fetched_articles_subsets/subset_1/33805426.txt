Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of disorders characterized by 
clonal expansion of abnormal hematopoietic stem cells leading to 
hyperproliferation of one or more myeloid lineages. The main complications in 
MPNs are high risk of thrombosis and progression to myelofibrosis and leukemia. 
MPN patients with high risk scores are treated by hydroxyurea (HU), 
interferon-α, or ruxolitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Polycythemia vera 
(PV) is an MPN characterized by overproduction of red blood cells (RBCs). ABCG2 
is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily transporters known to play a 
crucial role in multidrug resistance development. Proteome analysis showed 
higher ABCG2 levels in PV RBCs compared to RBCs from healthy controls and an 
additional increase of these levels in PV patients treated with HU, suggesting 
that ABCG2 might play a role in multidrug resistance in MPNs. In this work, we 
explored the role of ABCG2 in the transport of ruxolitinib and HU using human 
cell lines, RBCs, and in vitro differentiated erythroid progenitors. Using 
stopped-flow analysis, we showed that HU is not a substrate for ABCG2. Using 
transfected K562 cells expressing three different levels of recombinant ABCG2, 
MPN RBCs, and cultured erythroblasts, we showed that ABCG2 potentiates 
ruxolitinib-induced cytotoxicity that was blocked by the ABCG2-specific 
inhibitor KO143 suggesting ruxolitinib intracellular import by ABCG2. In silico 
modeling analysis identified possible ruxolitinib-binding site locations within 
the cavities of ABCG2. Our study opens new perspectives in ruxolitinib efficacy 
research targeting cell types depending on ABCG2 expression and polymorphisms 
among patients.
