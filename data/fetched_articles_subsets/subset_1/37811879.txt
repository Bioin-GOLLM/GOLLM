There are >170 naturally occurring RNA chemical modifications, with both known 
and unknown biological functions. Analytical methods for detecting chemical 
modifications and for analyzing their effects are relatively limited and have 
had difficulty keeping pace with the demand for RNA chemical biology and 
biochemistry research. Some modifications can affect the ability of RNA to 
hybridize with its complementary sequence or change the selectivity of base 
pairing. Here, we investigate the use of affinity-based DNA nanoswitches to 
resolve energetic differences in hybridization. We found that a single m3C 
modification can sufficiently destabilize hybridization to abolish a detection 
signal, while an s4U modification can selectively hybridize with G over A. These 
results establish proof of concept for using DNA nanoswitches to detect certain 
RNA modifications and analyzing their effects in base pairing stability and 
specificity.
