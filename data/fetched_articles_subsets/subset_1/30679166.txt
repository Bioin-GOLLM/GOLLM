Progressive cone and cone-rod dystrophies are a clinically and genetically 
heterogeneous group of inherited retinal diseases characterised by cone 
photoreceptor degeneration, which may be followed by subsequent rod 
photoreceptor loss. These disorders typically present with progressive loss of 
central vision, colour vision disturbance and photophobia. Considerable progress 
has been made in elucidating the molecular genetics and genotype-phenotype 
correlations associated with these dystrophies, with mutations in at least 30 
genes implicated in this group of disorders. We discuss the genetics, and 
clinical, psychophysical, electrophysiological and retinal imaging 
characteristics of cone and cone-rod dystrophies, focusing particularly on four 
of the most common disease-associated genes: GUCA1A, PRPH2, ABCA4 and RPGR 
Additionally, we briefly review the current management of these disorders and 
the prospects for novel therapies.
