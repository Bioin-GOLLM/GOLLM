We aim to characterize the clinical features and genetic causes for two affected 
siblings from a Chinese family with cone dystrophy (CD). Two patients and four 
unaffected family members were recruited and received complete ophthalmic 
examinations. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood samples from 
all patients. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach followed by 
intrafamilal cosegregation and in silico analyses were employed to determine the 
genetic defects. Ophthalmic evaluations finalized the clinical diagnosis of CD 
for the two patients in this family, both of whom presented macular atrophy with 
no remarkable changes in the peripheral retina. Comprehensive genetic screening 
approach revealed biallelic missense mutations in the Leber congenital amaurosis 
5 (LCA5) gene, p.[Ala212Pro];[Tyr441Cys], as disease causative for this family. 
Both mutations were novel. The first substitution was predicted to eliminate a 
hydrogen bond and alter the tertiary structure of lebercilin, protein encoded by 
LCA5. We for the first time report novel biallelic LCA5 mutations in causing CD. 
Our study extends the phenotypic and genotypic spectrums for LCA5-associated 
retinopathies and better illustrates its genotype-phenotype correlations, which 
would help with better genetic diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment 
for CD patients.
