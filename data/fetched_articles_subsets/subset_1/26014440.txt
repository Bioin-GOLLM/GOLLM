Dysregulation of MYBL2 has been associated to tumorigenesis and the S427G 
polymorphism could induce partial inactivation of MYBL2, associating it with 
cancer risk. It has previously been shown that MYBL2 was over-expressed in some 
acute myeloid leukemias (AML), portending poor prognosis. However, to date no 
studies have investigated the S427G or other genetic variants of MYBL2 in AML. 
This study analyzed the S427G in 197 AML patients and 179 controls and screened 
the MYBL2 sequence in patients. In contrast to other studies in solid tumors, 
the S427G was not associated with the incidence of AML. This study detected four 
unannotated genetic alterations, of which the Q67X could be involved in MYBL2 
dysfunction. Eight polymorphisms were identified, among which the rs73116571, 
located in a splicing region, was associated with higher incidence in AML and 
weaker MYBL2 expression, suggesting pre-disposition to AML. Additional 
functional studies should be performed to verify these genetic variations as 
possible targets in AML.
