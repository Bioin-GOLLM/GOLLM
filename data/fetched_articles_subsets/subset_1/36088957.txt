Hepatitis B is considered an important public health problem worldwide because 
it is a chronic infection with a risk factor for cirrhosis and cellular 
hepatocellular carcinoma. In Brazil, the Rondônia State ranks first in the 
Northern region regarding the number of deaths due to hepatitis B. In the Amazon 
basin, genotype F is considered specific to the Americas identified in native 
populations. But few data on HBV genotyping and phylogenetic analysis are 
available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotypes and 
subgenotypes of the hepatitis B virus in indigenous people chronic carriers 
residing in cities of Guajará Mirim and Nova Mamoré in state of Rondônia/Brazil, 
on the border with Bolivia. A fragment of 417 bp (S gene) was amplified by PCR 
and submitted to nucleotide sequencing. The genotypes and subgenotypes of the 
HBV strains were determined through phylogenetic inference using genomic 
sequences from 197 representatives of the genotypes (A-H). Of the 41 chronic 
hepatitis B patients enrolled in this study, 27 were HBV-DNA positive. Of the 27 
DNA-HBV positives, 39% (17/41) had individual HBV infection and 27% (10/41) were 
coinfected with HDV. The frequency of genotypes was 40.7% (11/27) for genotype D 
(HBV-D), 33.3% (9/27) for genotype F (HBV-F) and 25.9% (7/27) for genotype A 
(HBV-A) with circulating subgenotypes F2, F4, D2, D3, A1, and A2. We 
characterized the genotypes and subgenotypes of HBV circulating among in 
indigenous in the State of Rondônia shows for the first time the HBV/D genotype 
whit greater frequency circulating in nativos of state Rondônia. In conclusion, 
our findings showed a diversity of HBV genotypes, which is also found in other 
Brazilian geographical regions.
