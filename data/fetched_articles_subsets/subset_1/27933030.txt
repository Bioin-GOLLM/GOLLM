Although the insight phenomenon has attracted great attention from 
psychologists, it is still largely unknown whether its variation in 
well-functioning human adults has a genetic basis. Several lines of evidence 
suggest that genes involved in dopamine (DA) transmission might be potential 
candidates. The present study explored for the first time the association of 
dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) with insight problem solving. Fifteen 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering DRD2 were genotyped in 425 
unrelated healthy Chinese undergraduates, and were further tested for 
association with insight problem solving. Both single SNP and haplotype analysis 
revealed several associations of DRD2 SNPs and haplotypes with insight problem 
solving. In conclusion, the present study provides the first evidence for the 
involvement of DRD2 in insight problem solving, future studies are necessary to 
validate these findings.
