The genome-wide variation of multiple epigenetic modifications in CpG islands 
(CGIs) and the interactions between them are of great interest. Here, we 
optimized an entropy-based strategy to quantify variation of epigenetic 
modifications and explored their interaction across mouse embryonic stem cells, 
neural precursor cells and brain. Our results showed that four epigenetic 
modifications (DNA methylation, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) of CGIs in the 
mouse genome undergo combinatorial variation during neuron differentiation. DNA 
methylation variation was positively correlated with H3K27me3 variation, and 
negatively correlated with H3K4me2/3 variation. We identified 5,194 CGIs 
differentially modified by epigenetic modifications (DEM-CGIs). Among them, the 
differentially DNA methylated CGIs overlapped significantly with the CGIs 
differentially modified by H3K27me3. Moreover, DEM-CGIs may contribute to 
co-regulation of related developmental genes including core transcription 
factors. Our entropy-based strategy provides an effective way of investigating 
dynamic cross-talk among epigenetic modifications in various biological 
processes at the macro scale.
