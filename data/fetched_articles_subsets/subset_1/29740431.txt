OBJECTIVE: Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular 
enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) is a rare syndrome with relapsing 
brainstem/cerebellar symptoms. To examine the pathogenic processes and 
investigate potential biomarkers, we analyzed combined materials of brain and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by comprehensive methodologies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To identify major pathways of perivascular inflammation 
in CLIPPERS, we first compared the CSF proteome (n = 5) to a neurodegenerative 
condition, Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 5). Activation of complement was 
confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on CLIPPERS brain samples (n = 3) and by 
ELISA in the CSF. For potential biomarkers, we used biomarker arrays, and 
compared inflammatory and vessel-associated proteins in the CSF of CLIPPERS 
(n = 5) with another inflammatory relapsing CNS disease, multiple sclerosis 
(RMS, n = 9) and healthy subjects (HS, n = 7).
RESULTS: Two hundred and seven proteins in the CSF discriminated CLIPPERS from 
AD. The complement cascade, immunoglobulins, and matrix proteins were among the 
most frequently represented pathways. Pathway analysis of upstream regulators 
suggested the importance of vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1), IFN-γ, 
interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-10. Differential regulation of more than 10 
complement proteins of the 3 complement pathways in the CSF pointed to the role 
of complement activation. IHC on brain samples confirmed the perivascular 
complement activation, i.e., deposition of C3bc, C3d, and the terminal C5b-9 
complement complex that partially overlapped with accumulation of IgG in the 
vessel wall. Besides endothelial cell damage, reactivity to smooth muscle actin 
was lost in the walls of inflamed vessels, but the glia limitans was preserved. 
The semi-quantitative array indicated that increased level of IL-8/CXCL8 
(p < 0.05), eotaxin/CCL11 (p < 0.01), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 
(p < 0.05) in CSF could distinguish CLIPPERS from HS. The quantitative array 
confirmed elevated concentration of IL-8/CXCL8 and eotaxin/CCL11 compared to HS 
(p < 0.05, respectively) besides increased levels of ICAM-1 (p < 0.05) and 
VCAM-1 (p < 0.001). The increased concentration of VCAM-1 were able to 
differentiate CLIPPERS from RMS (p < 0.01), and a trend of elevated levels of 
ICAM-1 and IL-8/CXCL8 compared to RMS was also observed (p = 0.06, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Complement activation, IgG deposition, and alterations of the 
extracellular matrix may contribute to inflammation in CLIPPERS. VCAM1, ICAM1, 
and IL-8 in the CSF may differentiate CLIPPERS from RMS.
