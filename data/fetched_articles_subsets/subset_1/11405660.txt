A family of analogues of des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8)/D2Nal(8)]-SRIF that contain a 
4-(N-isopropyl)-aminomethylphenylalanine (IAmp) at position 9 was identified 
that has high affinity and selectivity for human somatostatin receptor subtype 1 
(sst1). The binding affinities of des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF 
(c[H-Cys-Lys-Phe-Phe-DTrp-IAmp-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Cys-OH], CH-275) (7), 
des-AA(1,5)-[Tyr(2),DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF (CH-288) (16), 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[Tyr(7),DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF (23), and 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8),IAmp(9),Tyr(11)]-SRIF (25) are about (1)/(7), (1)/(4), 
(1)/(125), and (1)/(4) that of SRIF-28 (1) to sst1, respectively, about 
(1)/(65), (1)/(130), <(1)/(1000), and <(1)/(150) that of 1 to sst3, 
respectively, and about or less than (1)/(1000) that of 1 to the other three 
human SRIF receptor subtypes. A substitution of DTrp(8) by D2Nal(8) in 7 to 
yield des-AA(1,2,5)-[D2Nal(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF (13) and in 16 to yield 
des-AA(1,5)-[Tyr(2),D2Nal(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF (17) was intended to increase 
chemical stability, selectivity, and affinity and resulted in two analogues that 
were less potent or equipotent with similar selectivity, respectively. 
Carbamoylation of the N-terminus as in 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8),IAmp(9),Tyr(11)]-Cbm-SRIF (27) increased affinity 
slightly as well as improved selectivity. Monoiodination of 25 to yield 26 and 
of 27 to yield 28 resulted in an additional 4-fold increase in affinity at sst1. 
Desamination of the N-terminus of 17 to yield 18, on the other hand, resulted in 
significant loss of affinity. Attempts at reducing the size of the ring with 
maintenance of selectivity failed in that 
des-AA(1,4,5,13)-[Tyr(2),DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF (33) and 
des-AA(1,4,5,6,12,13)-[Tyr(2),DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF (34) progressively lost 
affinity for all receptors. Both 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8),IAmp(9),Tyr(11)]-Cbm-SRIF (27) and 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[DCys(3),DTrp(8),IAmp(9),Tyr(11)]-Cbm-SRIF (29) show agonistic 
activity in a cAMP assay; therefore, the structural basis for the agonist 
property of this family of analogues is not contingent upon the chirality of the 
Cys residue at position 3 as shown to be the case in 18-membered ring SRIF 
octapeptides. None of the high affinity structures described here showed 
receptor antagonism. We have prepared the radiolabeled 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8),IAmp(9),(125)ITyr(11)]-SRIF ((125)I-25) and 
des-AA(1,2,5)-[DTrp(8),IAmp(9), (125)ITyr(11)]-Cbm-SRIF ((125)I-27), used them 
as in vitro tracers, and found them to be superior to 
des-AA(1,5)-[(125)ITyr(2),DTrp(8),IAmp(9)]-SRIF ((125)I-16) for the detection of 
sst1 tumors in receptor autoradiography studies.
