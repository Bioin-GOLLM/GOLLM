INTRODUCTION: To investigate the clinical characteristics and disease outcomes 
of a pedigree with compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC22A5 gene.
METHODS: Serum acylcarnitine profiles of patients were analyzed using tandem 
mass spectrometry. DNA samples isolated from patients and their first-degree 
relatives were subjected to high-throughput sequencing, and mutations were 
validated using Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: The proband, a 4-month-old girl, presented with seizure episodes and 
mild cardiac hypertrophy and was diagnosed with primary carnitine deficiency 
(PCD), with carnitine levels of 5.165 mol/L. Her brother, a 6-year-and 
4-month-old boy, was also diagnosed with PCD with serum-free carnitine levels of 
1.014 mol/L (reference values 10-60 mol/L). Compound heterozygous mutations 
(c.760C > T [p.R254X] and c.825G > A [p.W275X]) were detected in the SLC22A5 
gene in both patients and were inherited from the mother and father, 
respectively. Oral L-carnitine significantly improved or resolved the clinical 
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Children with compound mutations in SLC22A5 may present different 
clinical manifestations, particularly at different ages. Early clinical 
manifestations have a greater impact on the organs and may cause irreversible 
damage. PCD can cause epilepsy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Tandem mass 
spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing are recommended to confirm the 
diagnosis. Early L-carnitine supplementation can improve symptoms and reverse 
organ damage in some children. Tandem mass spectrometry should be used to screen 
for newborns with a family history of PCD.
