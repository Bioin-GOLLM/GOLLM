The purpose of this study is to determine whether esophageal varices (EV) can be 
identified through the evaluation of spleen stiffness (SSM) via acoustic 
radiation force impulse (ARFI). A total of 135 patients suffering from cirrhosis 
underwent a clinical exam, laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver 
stiffness (LSM) measurement, SSM evaluation and upper gastrointestinal 
endoscopy. Based on the endoscopy results, the patients were classified into 
three groups: those with no evident EV, those with small EV and those with 
varices needing treatment (VNT). Patients with EV of any grade had significantly 
higher average SSM values over those with no EV (3.37 m/s versus 2.79 m/s, 
p-value < 0.001), while patients with VNT showed an even greater difference 
(3.96 m/s versus 2.93 m/s, p-value < 0.001). SSM proved to be an excellent 
method of predicting patients with VNT.
