Methionine-1 (M1)-linked ubiquitin chains regulate the activity of NF-κB, immune 
homeostasis, and responses to infection. The importance of negative regulators 
of M1-linked chains in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the 
M1-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN is essential for preventing TNF-associated 
systemic inflammation in humans and mice. A homozygous hypomorphic mutation in 
human OTULIN causes a potentially fatal autoinflammatory condition termed 
OTULIN-related autoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS). Four independent OTULIN mouse 
models reveal that OTULIN deficiency in immune cells results in 
cell-type-specific effects, ranging from over-production of inflammatory 
cytokines and autoimmunity due to accumulation of M1-linked polyubiquitin and 
spontaneous NF-κB activation in myeloid cells to downregulation of 
M1-polyubiquitin signaling by degradation of LUBAC in B and T cells. Remarkably, 
treatment with anti-TNF neutralizing antibodies ameliorates inflammation in ORAS 
patients and rescues mouse phenotypes. Hence, OTULIN is critical for 
restraining life-threatening spontaneous inflammation and maintaining immune 
homeostasis.
