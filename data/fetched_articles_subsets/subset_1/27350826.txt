Evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies has shown that 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce the risk of colorectal 
cancer (CRC). The function of NSAIDs and the molecular targets for 
chemopreventive effects on CRC have been extensively studied and their data were 
reported. However, the relation between NSAIDs and the risk factors of CRC have 
not been fully elucidated yet. Thus, relations between NSAIDs and the risk 
factors of CRC, such as overweight and obesity, alcohol, aging, 
hypertriglyceridemia and smoking, are summarized with our data and with recent 
reported data in this review.
