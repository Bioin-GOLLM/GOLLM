We present a high-content analysis (HCA) protocol for monitoring the outgrowth 
capacity of human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). 
We describe steps to perform HCA imaging, followed by quantifying the morphology 
of dendrites and axons within a high-throughput system to evaluate neurons 
obtained through various differentiation approaches. This protocol can be used 
to screen for modulators of neuronal morphogenesis or neurotoxicity. The 
approach can be applied to patient-derived iPSCs to identify patient-specific 
defects and possible therapeutic strategies. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Zink et al. (2020) and Inak et al. 
(2021). The protocol can be used in combination with Zink et al. (2022).
