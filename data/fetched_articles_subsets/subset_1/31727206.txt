Radiotherapy (RT) is an important treatment for non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). However, the major obstacles to successful RT include the low 
radiosensitivity of cancer cells and the restricted radiation dose, which is 
given without damaging normal tissues. Therefore, the sensitizer that increases 
RT efficacy without dose escalation will be beneficial for NSCLC treatment. 
Eurycomalactone (ECL), an active quassinoid isolated from Eurycoma longifolia 
Jack, has been demonstrated to possess anticancer activity. In this study, we 
aimed to investigate the effect of ECL on sensitizing NSCLC cells to X-radiation 
(X-ray) as well as the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that ECL 
exhibited selective cytotoxicity against the NSCLC cells A549 and COR-L23 
compared to the normal lung fibroblast. Clonogenic survival results indicated 
that ECL treatment prior to irradiation synergistically decreased the A549 and 
COR-L23 colony number. ECL treatment reduced the expression of cyclin B1 and 
CDK1/2 leading to induce cell cycle arrest at the radiosensitive G₂/M phase. 
Moreover, ECL markedly delayed the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand 
breaks (DSBs). In A549 cells, pretreatment with ECL not only delayed the 
resolving of radiation-induced γ-H2AX foci but also blocked the formation of 
53BP1 foci at the DSB sites. In addition, ECL pretreatment attenuated the 
expression of DNA repair proteins Ku-80 and KDM4D in both NSCLC cells. 
Consequently, these effects led to an increase in apoptosis in irradiated cells. 
Thus, ECL radiosensitized the NSCLC cells to X-ray via G₂/M arrest induction and 
delayed the repair of X-ray-induced DSBs. This study offers a great potential 
for ECL as an alternative safer radiosensitizer for increasing the RT efficiency 
against NSCLC.
