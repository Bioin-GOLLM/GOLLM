AIMS: Recently, an association between two polymorphisms (1181G>C and 245T>G) of 
the osteoprotegerin (OPG) gene and diabetic Charcot neuroarthropathy was 
suggested on the basis of studies of a limited number of samples derived from 
subjects from one geographical region (Italy). The aim of this study was to 
assess the presence of various osteoprotegerin gene polymorphisms in patients 
with diabetes and Charcot neuroarthropathy compared with subjects with diabetic 
neuropathy but no Charcot foot and healthy controls from another geographical 
region (Poland).
METHODS: DNA was isolated from 54 patients with Charcot neuroarthropathy, 35 
subjects with diabetic neuropathy but no Charcot foot, and 95 healthy controls 
to evaluate OPG gene polymorphisms and their possible contribution to the 
development of Charcot neuroarthropathy.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between the group of subjects 
with neuropathy but no Charcot neuroarthropathy and the control group were found 
for 1217C>T, 950T>C and 245T>G polymorphisms, between the group of patients with 
Charcot neuroarthropathy and the control group for 1181G>C and 950T>C 
polymorphisms, and between the group of subjects with neuropathy but no Charcot 
neuroarthropathy and the group of patients with Charcot neuroarthropathy for 
1217C>T and 245T>G polymorphisms.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that genetic factors, particularly OPG gene 
polymorphisms, may play a role in the development of diabetic Charcot 
neuroarthropathy.
