Long-lived parasites evade host immunity through highly evolved molecular 
strategies. The murine intestinal helminth, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, 
down-modulates the host immune system through release of an immunosuppressive 
TGF-β mimic, TGM1, which is a divergent member of the CCP (Sushi) protein 
family. TGM1 comprises 5 domains, of which domains 1-3 (D1/2/3) bind mammalian 
TGF-β receptors, acting on T cells to induce Foxp3+ regulatory T cells; however, 
the roles of domains 4 and 5 (D4/5) remain unknown. We noted that truncated 
TGM1, lacking D4/5, showed reduced potency. Combination of D1/2/3 and D4/5 as 
separate proteins did not alter potency, suggesting that a physical linkage is 
required and that these domains do not deliver an independent signal. 
Coprecipitation from cells treated with biotinylated D4/5, followed by mass 
spectrometry, identified the cell surface protein CD44 as a coreceptor for TGM1. 
Both full-length and D4/5 bound strongly to a range of primary cells and cell 
lines, to a greater degree than D1/2/3 alone, although some cell lines did not 
respond to TGM1. Ectopic expression of CD44 in nonresponding cells conferred 
responsiveness, while genetic depletion of CD44 abolished enhancement by D4/5 
and ablated the ability of full-length TGM1 to bind to cell surfaces. Moreover, 
CD44-deficient T cells showed attenuated induction of Foxp3 by full-length TGM1, 
to levels similar to those induced by D1/2/3. Hence, a parasite protein known to 
bind two host cytokine receptor subunits has evolved a third receptor 
specificity, which serves to raise the avidity and cell type-specific potency of 
TGF-β signaling in mammalian cells.
