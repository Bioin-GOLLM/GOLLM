OBJECTIVE: Glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA type subunit 1 (GRIA1) is a 
subunit of a ligand-gated ion channel that regulates the secretion of 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by controlling 
the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Few studies have investigated the 
association between the GRIA1 gene and human infertility. This study evaluated 
the association of the GRIA1 rs548294 C > T and rs2195450 G > A polymorphisms 
with the ovarian response to human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) in Iranian 
women.
METHODS: One hundred women with histories of at least 1 year of infertility were 
included. On the second day of menstruation, patients were injected with HMG; on 
the third day, blood samples were collected. After hormonal analysis, the GRIA1 
rs548294 C > T and rs2195450 G > A genotypes of samples were identified via the 
restriction fragment length polymorphism method, and on day 9, the number of 
follicles was assessed via ultrasound.
RESULTS: For the GRIA1 rs548294 C > T and rs2195450 G > A single nucleotide 
polymorphisms, the subjects with CT and GG genotypes, respectively, displayed 
the highest mean FSH level, LH level, and number of follicles on day 9 of the 
menstrual cycle (p< 0.05). Significant positive correlations were observed 
between LH and FSH (p< 0.01), LH and follicle count (p< 0.01), FSH and age (p< 
0.05), follicle count and age (p= 0.048), and FSH and follicle count (p< 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study showed a significant relationship between GRIA1 
polymorphisms and ovarian response to the induction of ovulation. Therefore, 
determining patients' GRIA1 genotype may be useful for improving treatment and 
prescribing suitable doses of ovulation-stimulating drugs.
