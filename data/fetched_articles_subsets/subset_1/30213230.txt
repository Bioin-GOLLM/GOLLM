Development of an α-synuclein (α-Syn) positron emission tomography agent for the 
diagnosis and evaluation of Parkinson disease therapy is a key goal of 
neurodegenerative disease research. BF-227 has been described as an α-Syn binder 
and hence was employed as a lead to generate a library of α-Syn-binding 
compounds. [3H]BF-227 bound to α-Syn and amyloid β peptide (Aβ) fibrils with 
affinities (KD) of 46.0 nM and 15.7 nM, respectively. Affinities of BF-227-like 
compounds (expressed as Ki) for α-Syn and Aβ fibrils were determined, along with 
5 reference compounds (flutafuranol, flutemetamol, florbetapir, BF-227, and 
PiB). Selectivity for α-Syn binding, defined as the Ki(Aβ)/Ki(α-Syn) ratio, was 
0.23 for BF-227. A similar or lower ratio was measured for analogues decorated 
with alkyl or oxyethylene chains attached to the oxygen at the 6 position of 
BF-227, suggesting a lack of involvement of the side chain in fibril binding. 
BF-227-like iodobenzoxazoles had lower affinities and poor α-Syn selectivity. 
However, BF-227-like fluorobenzoxazoles had improved α-Syn selectively having 
Ki(Aβ)/Ki(α-Syn) ranging from 2.2 to 5.1 with appreciable fibril affinity, 
although not sufficient to warrant further investigation. Compounds based on 
fluorobenzoxazoles might offer an approach to obtaining an α-Syn imaging agent 
with an appropriate affinity and selectivity.
