The novel mRNA vaccinations against COVID-19 are gaining worldwide attention for 
their potential efficacy, as well as for the diagnosis of some 
post-vaccination-reported adverse reactions. In this state-of-the-art review 
article, we present the current evidence regarding mainly the diagnosis of 
spontaneous allergic reactions, the skin occurrences, the vascular, blood, 
endocrine and heart events, the respiratory reports, the gastrointestinal, 
hepatic and kidney events, the reproductive and pregnancy issues and the muscle 
events, as well as the ear, eye, neurologic and psychiatric events following 
mRNA vaccination against COVID-19. We further present some evidence regarding 
the mRNA strategies, we provide important information for side effects 
associated with the spike protein based LNP-mRNA vaccine and its adjuvants, as 
well as evidence for all the possible dangerous roles of the spike protein, and 
we discuss our expert opinion on the knowns and the unknowns towards the topic.
