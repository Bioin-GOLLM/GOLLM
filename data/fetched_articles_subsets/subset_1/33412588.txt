Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are widely utilized for transcriptional repression 
in eukaryotes. Here, we characterize, in the protist Tetrahymena thermophila, 
the EZL1 (E(z)-like 1) complex, with components conserved in metazoan Polycomb 
Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). The EZL1 complex is required for 
histone H3 K27 and K9 methylation, heterochromatin formation, transposable 
element control, and programmed genome rearrangement. The EZL1 complex interacts 
with EMA1, a helicase required for RNA interference (RNAi). This interaction is 
implicated in co-transcriptional recruitment of the EZL1 complex. Binding of 
H3K27 and H3K9 methylation by PDD1-another PcG protein interacting with the EZL1 
complex-reinforces its chromatin association. The EZL1 complex is an integral 
part of Polycomb bodies, which exhibit dynamic distribution in Tetrahymena 
development: Their dispersion is driven by chromatin association, while their 
coalescence by PDD1, likely via phase separation. Our results provide a 
molecular mechanism connecting RNAi and Polycomb repression, which coordinately 
regulate nuclear bodies and reorganize the genome.
