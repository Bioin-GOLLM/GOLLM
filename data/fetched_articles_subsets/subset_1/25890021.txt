BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) participates in lipoprotein metabolism and 
immune regulation. This study assessed association between ApoE polymorphisms 
with hyperuricemia and uric acid metabolism in Uygur men, Xinjiang, China.
METHODS: A total of 474 hyperuricemia patients and 518 healthy male controls 
were recruited from the Health Screening Center, Uygur region of Xinjiang, China 
and subjected to ApoE genotyping using a multiplex amplification refractory 
mutation system PCR.
RESULTS: Apolipoprotein E3/3 genotype was the predominant type with a frequency 
of 67.7%, while E2/2 was lower than E4/4 in Uygur males. The frequencies of 
ApoE2, E3, and E4 alleles were 8.5%, 80.1% and 11.4%, respectively. Distribution 
of ApoE genotypes was significantly different in hyperuricemia patients from the 
healthy controls (p<0.001). Particularly, the frequency of ApoE E3/3 was 71.7%, 
E2/3 9.3%, E3/4 9.3%, E4/4 3.2%, E2/4 2.3%, and E2/2 0.2% in patients vs. 68.1%, 
4.6%, 2.9%, 12%, 0.6%, and 4.6% in controls, respectively. Moreover, frequency 
of ApoE E2 allele was greater in the healthy controls than in patients (p<0.001) 
and the highest level of uric acid occurred in those with ApoE2/4 and E3/4 
genotypes, whereas the lowest uric acid level occurred in those with ApoE E2/2 
genotype. In addition, the subjects with the ApoE2 allele had a lower uric acid 
and LDL-C level than those with the ApoE3 allele and ApoE4 allele (p<0.05). The 
risk of developing hyperuricemia in subjects without the ApoE2 allele was 1.7 
fold higher than those subjects with the ApoE2 allele.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed frequencies and distributions of ApoE alleles 
and genotypes in Uygur males, which are different from Han Chinese. ApoE E4 was 
associated with a slightly higher risk of primary hyperuricemia, whereas ApoE E2 
was associated with reduced risk of primary hyperuricemia and LDL-C level.
