BACKGROUND: Altered expression of the cluster differentiation antigen, CD14, may 
affect the proportion of T-helper type 1 (Th1) to Th2 cells, thereby influencing 
the immunoglobulin E (IgE) response and associated inflammatory phenotype in 
allergic conditions. Therefore, the gene encoding CD14 is considered as a 
positional candidate gene for atopy. Recently, a functional C-159 T polymorphism 
has been described in the promoter region of the gene and has been associated 
with increased gene expression and atopic phenotypes in various ethnic 
populations. We evaluated the relationship between the C-159 T polymorphism in 
the promoter of the CD14 gene and the total serum IgE level in Chinese adult 
patients with allergic rhinitis.
METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) analysis was used to determine the C-159 T polymorphism in subjects with 
allergic rhinitis (n = 92) and nonallergic disease controls (n = 72). Total 
serum IgE was also measured.
RESULTS: In the allergic rhinitis group, the frequency of the TT homozygotes was 
significantly higher than for the control group (p < 0.05). In both groups, the 
C-159 T polymorphism is not associated with serum IgE levels.
CONCLUSION: TT homozygotes are more common in adult patients with allergic 
rhinitis among the Chinese population.
