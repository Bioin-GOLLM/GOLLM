Antibiotic resistance arises through mechanisms such as selection of naturally 
occurring resistant mutants and horizontal gene transfer. Recently, oxidative 
stress has been implicated as one of the mechanisms whereby bactericidal 
antibiotics kill bacteria. Here, we show that sublethal levels of bactericidal 
antibiotics induce mutagenesis, resulting in heterogeneous increases in the 
minimum inhibitory concentration for a range of antibiotics, irrespective of the 
drug target. This increase in mutagenesis correlates with an increase in ROS and 
is prevented by the ROS scavenger thiourea and by anaerobic conditions, 
indicating that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics induce mutagenesis by 
stimulating the production of ROS. We demonstrate that these effects can lead to 
mutant strains that are sensitive to the applied antibiotic but resistant to 
other antibiotics. This work establishes a radical-based molecular mechanism 
whereby sublethal levels of antibiotics can lead to multidrug resistance, which 
has important implications for the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics.
