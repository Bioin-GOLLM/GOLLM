Oncolytic vaccinia viruses have promising efficacy and safety profiles in cancer 
therapy. Although antitumor activity can be increased by manipulating viral 
genes, the relative efficacy of individual modifications has been difficult to 
assess without side-by-side comparisons. This study sought to compare the 
initial antitumor activity after intravenous administration of five vaccinia 
virus variants of the same Western Reserve backbone and thymidine kinase gene 
deletion in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice with spontaneous pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumors. Tumors had focal regions of infection at 5 days after all viruses. 
Natural killer (NK) cells were restricted to these sites of infection, but CD8+ 
T cells and tumor cell apoptosis were widespread and varied among the viruses. 
Antitumor activity of virus VV-A34, bearing amino acid substitution A34K151E to 
increase viral spreading, and virus VV-IL2v, expressing a mouse IL2 variant 
(mIL2v) with attenuated IL2 receptor alpha subunit binding, was similar to 
control virus VV-GFP. However, antitumor activity was significantly greater 
after virus VV-A34/IL2v, which expressed mIL2v together with A34K151E mutation 
and viral B18R gene deletion, and virus VV-GMCSF that expressed mouse GM-CSF. 
Both viruses greatly increased expression of CD8 antigens Cd8a/Cd8b1 and 
cytotoxicity genes granzyme A, granzyme B, Fas ligand, and perforin-1 in tumors. 
VV-A34/IL2v led to higher serum IL2 and greater tumor expression of death 
receptor ligand TRAIL, but VV-GMCSF led to higher serum GM-CSF, greater 
expression of leukocyte chemokines and adhesion molecules, and more neutrophil 
recruitment. Together, the results show that antitumor activity is similarly 
increased by viral expression of GM-CSF or IL2v combined with additional genetic 
modifications.
