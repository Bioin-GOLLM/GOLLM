Therapy Induced Senescence (TIS) leads to sustained growth arrest of cancer 
cells. The associated cytostasis has been shown to be reversible and cells 
escaping senescence further enhance the aggressiveness of cancers. Chemicals 
specifically targeting senescent cells, so-called senolytics, constitute a 
promising avenue for improved cancer treatment in combination with targeted 
therapies. Understanding how cancer cells evade senescence is needed to optimise 
the clinical benefits of this therapeutic approach. Here we characterised the 
response of three different NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines to a combination of 
CDK4/6 and MEK inhibitors over 33 days. Transcriptomic data show that all cell 
lines trigger a senescence programme coupled with strong induction of 
interferons. Kinome profiling revealed the activation of Receptor Tyrosine 
Kinases (RTKs) and enriched downstream signaling of neurotrophin, ErbB and 
insulin pathways. Characterisation of the miRNA interactome associates 
miR-211-5p with resistant phenotypes. Finally, iCell-based integration of bulk 
and single-cell RNA-seq data identifies biological processes perturbed during 
senescence and predicts 90 new genes involved in its escape. Overall, our data 
associate insulin signaling with persistence of a senescent phenotype and 
suggest a new role for interferon gamma in senescence escape through the 
induction of EMT and the activation of ERK5 signaling.
