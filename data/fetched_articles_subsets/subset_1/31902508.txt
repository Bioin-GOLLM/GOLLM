Since late 2010, highly virulent PEDV G2-genotype strains have emerged globally 
extracting heavy losses on the pork industries of numerous countries. We 
investigated the characteristics of a field strain of PEDV (PEDV strain SH) 
isolated from a piglet with severe diarrhea on a farm in Shanghai China. Whole 
genome sequencing and analysis revealed that the SH strain belonged to subtype 
G2b and has a unique 12-aa deletion (aa 399-410) including the antigenic epitope 
NEP-1C9 (aa 398-406) of the N protein. PEDV SH strain is highly pathogenic to 
challenged newborn piglets, resulting in 100 % morbidity and mortality. 
Pathological examination revealed significant villus atrophy in the jejuna of 
infected piglets. Mice inoculated with inactivated PEDV SH produced antibodies 
against the N protein, but no antibodies against the deletions. These results 
illustrated that deletion of the NEP-1C9 epitope had no effect on the 
immunogenicity or pathogenicity of PEDV, providing evidence of the necessity to 
monitor the genetic diversity of the virus. Our study also contributes to 
development of candidate for vaccines and diagnostics that could differentiate 
pigs seropositive due to vaccination by conventional strains from wild virus 
infection.
