Cyanobacterial cyclopeptides, including microcystins and nodularins, are 
considered a health hazard to humans due to the possible toxic effects of high 
consumption. From a pharmacological standpoint, microcystins are stable 
hydrophilic cyclic heptapeptides with a potential to cause cellular damage 
following uptake via organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP). Their 
intracellular biological effects involve inhibition of catalytic subunits of 
protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2, glutathione depletion and generation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, certain OATPs are prominently 
expressed in cancers as compared to normal tissues, qualifying MC as potential 
candidates for cancer drug development. In the era of targeted cancer therapy, 
cyanotoxins comprise a rich source of natural cytotoxic compounds with a 
potential to target cancers expressing specific uptake transporters. Moreover, 
their structure offers opportunities for combinatorial engineering to enhance 
the therapeutic index and resolve organ-specific toxicity issues. In this 
article, we revisit cyanobacterial cyclopeptides as potential novel targets for 
anticancer drugs by summarizing existing biomedical evidence, presenting 
structure-activity data and discussing developmental perspectives.
