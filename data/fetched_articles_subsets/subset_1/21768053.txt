BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and dietary aflatoxin B1 
(AFB1) exposure are etiological factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 
countries with hot, humid climates. HCC often harbors a TP53 (tumor protein p53) 
mutation at codon 249 (R249S). In chronic carriers, 1762T/1764A mutations in the 
HBV X gene are associated with increased HCC risk. Both mutations have been 
detected in circulating cell-free DNA (CFDNA) from asymptomatic HBV carriers.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated seasonal variation in R249S and HBV in relation to AFB1 
exposure.
METHODS: R249S was quantitated by mass spectrometry in CFDNA in a 
cross-sectional survey of 473 asymptomatic subjects (237 HBV carriers and 236 
noncarriers) recruited in three villages in the Gambia over a 10-month period. 
1762T/1764A HBV mutations were detected by quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction. In addition, the HBV S gene was sequenced in 99 subjects positive for 
HBV surface antigen (HBsAg).
RESULTS: We observed a seasonal variation of serum R249S levels. Positivity for 
R249S and average concentration were significantly higher in HBsAg-positive 
subjects surveyed during April-July (61%; 5,690 ± 11,300 R249S copies/mL serum) 
than in those surveyed October-March [32% and 480 ± 1,030 copies/mL serum (odds 
ratio = 3.59; 95% confidence interval: 2.05, 6.30; p < 0.001)]. Positivity for 
HBV e antigen (HBeAg) (a marker of HBV replication) and viral DNA load also 
varied seasonally, with 15-30% of subjects surveyed between April and June HBeAg 
positive, compared with < 10% surveyed during other months. We detected 
1762T/1764A mutations in 8% of carriers, half of whom were positive for R249S. 
We found HBV genotype E in 95 of 99 HBsAg-positive subjects.
CONCLUSION: R249S is detectable in CFDNA of asymptomatic subjects. Evidence of 
temporal and quantitative variations suggests an interaction among AFB1 
exposure, HBV positivity, and replication on TP53 mutation formation or 
persistence.
