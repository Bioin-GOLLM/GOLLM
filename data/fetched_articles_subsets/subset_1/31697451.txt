RASopathies are a group of phenotypically overlapping disorders that arise from 
dysregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. These disorders include Noonan syndrome, 
Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, and neurofibromatosis-Type 1. 
While somatic mutations in the three human Ras genes (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS) are 
a common finding in a variety of cancers, germline mutations in each of the 
these genes cause developmental RASopathy phenotypes with mutations in specific 
genes typically correlating with specific phenotypes. We present the case of a 
germline heterozygous NRAS mutation producing a severe phenotype involving 
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, severe intellectual disability, and numerous 
melanocytic nevi in addition to more typical manifestations of Noonan syndrome. 
Additionally, the specific p.G12R NRAS mutation in this case is a common somatic 
mutation in cancer cells, and analysis of previously reported NRAS-RASopathy 
cases suggests that mutations at traditionally oncogenic codons are associated 
with elevated cancer risk not present with mutations at other sites.
