We report a case of an apparently sporadic paraganglioma of the tongue with a 
germ-line mutation in a female patient with asymptomatic Graves' disease. The 
tongue is an unusual primary location. Genetic testing is mandatory in all 
cases. Thyroid gland dysfunction and autoimmune phenomena could be associated 
with some paragangliomas.
