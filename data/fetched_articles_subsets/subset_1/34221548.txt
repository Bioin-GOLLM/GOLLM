Stroke can occur at any age or stage in life. Although it is commonly thought of 
as a disease amongst the elderly, it is important to highlight the fact that it 
also affects infants and children. In both populations, strokes have a high rate 
of morbidity and mortality. Arguably, it is more detrimental in the pediatric 
population given the occurrence at a younger age and therefore, a longer 
duration of disability, potentially over the entire lifespan. The high rate of 
morbidity and mortality in pediatrics is attributed to significant delays in 
diagnosis, as well as misdiagnosis. Acute stroke management is time dependent. 
Patients who receive acute treatment with either intravenous (IV) tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy, have improved mortality 
and functional outcomes. Additionally, the earlier treatment is initiated, the 
higher the likelihood of preserving penumbra, restoring cerebral blood flow and 
potentially reversing symptoms, thereby limiting disability. Prompt 
identification is essential as it leads to improved patient care in such a 
narrow therapeutic window. It enhances the care received during hospitalization 
and reduces the risk of early stroke recurrence. Despite limited data and lack 
of large randomized clinical trials in pediatrics, both IV tPA and mechanical 
thrombectomy have been successfully used. Bridging the gap of acute stroke 
management in the pediatric population is an essential part of minimizing 
adverse outcomes. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of pediatric 
stroke, the diverse etiologies, presentation as well as both acute and 
preventative management.
