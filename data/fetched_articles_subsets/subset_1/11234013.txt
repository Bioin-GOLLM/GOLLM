Cardiac conduction disorders slow the heart rhythm and cause disability in 
millions of people worldwide. Inherited mutations in SCN5A, the gene encoding 
the human cardiac sodium (Na+) channel, have been associated with rapid heart 
rhythms that occur suddenly and are life-threatening; however, a chief function 
of the Na+ channel is to initiate cardiac impulse conduction. Here we provide 
the first functional characterization of an SCN5A mutation that causes a 
sustained, isolated conduction defect with pathological slowing of the cardiac 
rhythm. By analysing the SCN5A coding region, we have identified a single 
mutation in five affected family members; this mutation results in the 
substitution of cysteine 514 for glycine (G514C) in the channel protein. 
Biophysical characterization of the mutant channel shows that there are 
abnormalities in voltage-dependent 'gating' behaviour that can be partially 
corrected by dexamethasone, consistent with the salutary effects of 
glucocorticoids on the clinical phenotype. Computational analysis predicts that 
the gating defects of G514C selectively slow myocardial conduction, but do not 
provoke the rapid cardiac arrhythmias associated previously with SCN5A 
mutations.
