Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of hardening and narrowing arteries, 
leading to cardiovascular disease accounting for the high mortality in the 
United States. For developing effective treatments for atherosclerosis, 
considerable efforts have been devoted to developing in vitro models. Compared 
to animal models, in vitro models can provide great opportunities to obtain data 
more efficiently, economically. Therefore, this review discusses the recent 
progress in in vitro models for atherosclerosis studies, including traditional 
two-dimensional (2D) systems cultured on the tissue culture plate, 2D cell 
sheets, and recently emerged microfluidic chip models with 2D culture. In 
addition, advanced in vitro three-dimensional models such as spheroids, 
cell-laden hydrogel constructs, tissue-engineered blood vessels, and 
vessel-on-a-chip will also be covered. Moreover, the functions of these models 
are also summarized along with model discussion. Lastly, the future perspectives 
of this field are discussed.
