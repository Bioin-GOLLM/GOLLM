Tumor suppressor p53 regulates the expression of p53-induced genes (PIG) that 
trigger apoptosis. PIG3 or TP53I3 is the only known member of the medium chain 
dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily induced by p53 and is used as a proapoptotic 
marker. Although the participation of PIG3 in the apoptotic pathway is proven, 
the protein and its mechanism of action were never characterized. We analyzed 
human PIG3 enzymatic function and found NADPH-dependent reductase activity with 
ortho-quinones, which is consistent with the classification of PIG3 in the 
quinone oxidoreductase family. However, the activity is much lower than that of 
zeta-crystallin, a better known quinone oxidoreductase. In addition, we report 
the crystallographic structure of PIG3, which allowed the identification of 
substrate- and cofactor-binding sites, with residues fully conserved from 
bacteria to human. Tyr-59 in zeta-crystallin (Tyr-51 in PIG3) was suggested to 
participate in the catalysis of quinone reduction. However, kinetics of Tyr/Phe 
and Tyr/Ala mutants of both enzymes demonstrated that the active site Tyr is not 
catalytic but may participate in substrate binding, consistent with a mechanism 
based on propinquity effects. It has been proposed that PIG3 contribution to 
apoptosis would be through oxidative stress generation. We found that in vitro 
activity and in vivo overexpression of PIG3 accumulate reactive oxygen species. 
Accordingly, an inactive PIG3 mutant (S151V) did not produce reactive oxygen 
species in cells, indicating that enzymatically active protein is necessary for 
this function. This supports that PIG3 action is through oxidative stress 
produced by its enzymatic activity and provides essential knowledge for eventual 
control of apoptosis.
