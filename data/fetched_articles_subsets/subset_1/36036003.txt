Oocyte quality is a determinant of a successful pregnancy. The final step of 
oocyte development is oocyte maturation, which is susceptible to environmental 
exposures. Aristolochic acids (AAs), widely existing in Aristolochia and Asarum 
plants that have been used in traditional medicine, can result in a smaller 
ovary and fewer superovulated oocytes after in vivo exposure to mice. However, 
whether AAs affect oocyte maturation and the underlying mechanism(s) are 
unclear. In this study, we focused on the effect of Aristolochic acid I (AAI), a 
major compound of AAs, on the maturation of in vitro cultured mouse oocytes. We 
showed that AAI exposure significantly decreased oocyte quality, including 
elevated aneuploidy, accompanied by aberrant chiasma patterns and spindle 
organization, and decreased first polar body extrusion and fertilization 
capability. Moreover, embryo development potential was also dramatically 
decreased. Further analyses revealed that AAI exposure significantly decreased 
mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis and increased the level of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), implying impaired mitochondrial function. 
Insufficient ATP supply can cause aberrant spindle assembly and excessive ROS 
can cause premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion and thus alterations in 
chiasma patterns. Both aberrant spindles and changed chiasma patterns can 
contribute to chromosome misalignment and thus aneuploidy. Therefore, AAI 
exposure decreases oocyte quality probably via impairing mitochondrial function.
