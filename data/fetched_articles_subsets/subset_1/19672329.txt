Red clover isoflavones are increasingly used in dietary supplements for their 
purported estrogenic effects. However, little is known about their metabolism in 
animals due to a lack of commercially available isotopically-labeled tracers. 
The goal of this research was to establish red clover cell culturing methodology 
for (14)C-biolabeling of isoflavones. When root, leaf, and petiole-derived 
suspension cultures were grown in darkness or light, dark-grown, petiole-derived 
solution cultures produced the highest concentrations of the two major red 
clover isoflavones, formononetin (0.67 mg/g FM inoculum) and biochanin A (0.13 
mg/g FM inoculum). Varying levels and timing of copper chloride elicitor did not 
significantly affect isoflavone accumulation. Approximately 38% of the 
(14)C-sucrose dose accumulated in the cells. Eighteen percent of the initial 
labeled dose was detected in the isoflavone-rich methanolic extract and of that, 
22% accumulated in isoflavones.
