BACKGROUND: The relationship between hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) has been found in various observational studies. Although hypouricemia is 
associated with cardiovascular events, it has not been established as a risk 
factor for CKD. We investigated the relationship between serum uric acid level 
and the loss of kidney function and incident CKD in healthy people.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy people were enrolled in this community-based 
prospective cohort study, the Saitama Cardiometabolic Disease and Organ 
Impairment Study, Japan. The analysis was conducted on 4188 subjects followed up 
for at least 3 years, 3102 for 6 years and 1052 for 9 years. Their data 
including glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline were examined every three 
years. The outcome event was incident CKD or the decrease in eGFR by more than 
25% in three years. Multivariate statistical models were adjusted for the 
baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: The following data was obtained: mean ± SD age, male, 39.6 ± 10.4 
years, female 38.4 ± 10.8 years; eGFR, male, 81.9 ± 16.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, female, 
82.1 ± 17.5 ml/min/1.73 m2; serum uric acid level, male, 5.8 ± 1.2 mg/dl, 
female, 4.1 ± 0.9 mg/dl. Both low and high serum uric acid levels were 
associated with the outcome and eGFR decline in males (multivariate logistic 
additional additive models, linear p = 0.0001, spline p = 0.043; generalized 
additive models, linear p = 0.0001, spline p = 0.012). In subjects with low 
serum uric acid levels (male, <5 mg/dl; female, <3.6 mg/dl), multivariate linear 
mixed models showed that low serum uric acid levels were associated with eGFR 
decline in a time-dependent manner (male, p = 0.0001; female, p = 0.045).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that low as well as high levels of uric acid are 
associated with the loss of kidney function. Hypouricemia is a candidate 
predictor of kidney function decline in healthy people.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: Since 1997, Saitama Health 
Promotion Corporation, a public interest corporation, supported the health of 
individuals, including children and adolescents, living or working in Saitama 
prefecture, primarily by carrying out various types of medical checkups. Only KS 
was employed by Saitama Health Promotion Corporation. He had no competing 
interests in this study. The other authors, EK, TM, YK, and KN, declare that 
they have no competing interests. This did not alter the authors’ adherence to 
PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials. Because of the informed consent 
from the subjects regarding their data being made publicly available was not 
obtained, there were restrictions on data sharing.
