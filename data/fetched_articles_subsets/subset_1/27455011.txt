OBJECTIVE: To detect the disease-causing mutation in a pedigree affected with 
autosomal dominant congenital cataract.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from peripheral blood samples 
from members of the pedigree and 100 healthy controls. Coding regions of 18 
candidate genes were screened with PCR and Sanger sequencing. Identified 
mutations were verified among 100 healthy individuals to exclude single 
nucleotide polymorphisms.
RESULTS: A heterozygous nonsense mutation c.471G>A of the CRYGD gene, which 
resulted in p.Trp157Term, was identified in all three patients. The same 
mutation was not found in the two normal individuals from the family and 100 
healthy controls. The nonsense mutation was predicted to be "disease causing" by 
Mutation t@sting program.
CONCLUSION: The nonsense mutation c.471G>A of the CRYGD gene probably underlies 
the congenital cataract in the pedigree.
