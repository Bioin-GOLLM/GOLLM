SLC26A4 gene mutations lead to Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss 
(DFNB4). The mouse model is well used to study the pathology of Pendred 
syndrome, however, mice with different Slc26a4 mutations exhibit different 
phenotypes, and these mice have severe deafness and inner ear malformations that 
are not imitated less severely Human phenotype. In this study, we generated a 
knock-in mouse model of Pendred syndrome with Slc26a4 L236P mutation to mimic 
the most common mutation found in human. Some L236P mice were observed to have 
significant vestibular dysfunction including torticollis and circling, the giant 
otoconia and destruction of the otoconial membrane was observed in L236P mice. 
Unlike other profoundly deafness in Slc26a4 mouse model, L236P mice present mild 
to profound hearing loss, consistent with the hearing threshold, inner ear hair 
cells also lost from slight to significant. Together, these data demonstrate 
that the L236P mouse phenotype is more similar to the human phenotype and should 
be used as a tool for further research into the human Pendred syndrome.
