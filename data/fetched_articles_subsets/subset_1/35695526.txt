The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intermittent (1-h), 
extended (4-h), and continuous ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) infusion against 
three extensively drug-resistant (XDR) sequence type (ST) 175 P. aeruginosa 
isolates with different susceptibilities to C/T (MIC = 2 to 16 mg/L) in a 7-day 
hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). C/T in continuous infusion achieved the 
largest reduction in total number of bacterial colonies in the overall treatment 
arms for both C/T-susceptible and -resistant isolates. It was also the only 
regimen with bactericidal activity against all three isolates. These data 
suggest that continuous C/T infusion should be considered a potential treatment 
for infections caused by XDR P. aeruginosa isolates, including nonsusceptible 
ones. Proper use of C/T dosing regimens may lead to better clinical management 
of XDR P. aeruginosa infections. IMPORTANCE Ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) is an 
antipseudomonal antibiotic with a high clinical impact in treating infection 
caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, but 
resistance is emerging. Given its time-dependent behavior, C/T continuous 
infusion can improve exposure and therefore the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
target attainment. We compared the efficacy of intermittent, extended, and 
continuous C/T infusion against three XDR ST175 P. aeruginosa isolates with 
different C/T MICs by means of an in vitro dynamic hollow-fiber model. We 
demonstrated that C/T in continuous infusion achieved the largest reduction in 
bacterial density in the overall treatment arms for both susceptible and 
resistant isolates. It was also the only regimen with bactericidal activity 
against all three isolates. Through this study, we want to demonstrate that 
developing individually tailored antimicrobial treatments is becoming essential. 
Our results support the role of C/T level monitoring and of dose adjustments for 
better clinical management and outcomes.
