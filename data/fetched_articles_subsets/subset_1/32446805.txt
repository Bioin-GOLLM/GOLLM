In an effort to improve the presentation of and information within tables and 
figures in clinical urology research, we propose a set of appropriate 
guidelines. We introduce 6 principles (1) include graphs only if they improve 
the reader's ability to understand the study findings; (2) think through how a 
graph might best convey information, do not just select a graph from preselected 
options on statistical software; (3) do not use graphs to replace reporting key 
numbers in the text of a paper; (4) graphs should give an immediate visual 
impression of the data; (5) make it beautiful; and (6) make the labels and 
legend clear and complete. We present a list of quick "dos and don'ts" for both 
tables and figures. Investigators should feel free to break any of the 
guidelines if it would result in a beautiful figure or a clear table that 
communicates data effectively. That said, we believe that the quality of tables 
and figures in the medical literature would improve if these guidelines were to 
be followed. PATIENT SUMMARY: A set of guidelines were developed for presenting 
figures and tables in urology research. The guidelines were developed by a broad 
group of statistical experts with special interest in urology.
