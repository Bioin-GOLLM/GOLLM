During meiosis, Structural Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) complexes underpin 
two fundamental features of meiosis: homologous recombination and chromosome 
segregation. While meiotic functions of the cohesin and condensin complexes have 
been delineated, the role of the third SMC complex, Smc5/6, remains enigmatic. 
Here we identify specific, essential meiotic functions for the Smc5/6 complex in 
homologous recombination and the regulation of cohesin. We show that Smc5/6 is 
enriched at centromeres and cohesin-association sites where it regulates 
sister-chromatid cohesion and the timely removal of cohesin from chromosomal 
arms, respectively. Smc5/6 also localizes to recombination hotspots, where it 
promotes normal formation and resolution of a subset of joint-molecule 
intermediates. In this regard, Smc5/6 functions independently of the major 
crossover pathway defined by the MutLÎ³ complex. Furthermore, we show that Smc5/6 
is required for stable chromosomal localization of the XPF-family endonuclease, 
Mus81-Mms4(Eme1). Our data suggest that the Smc5/6 complex is required for 
specific recombination and chromosomal processes throughout meiosis and that in 
its absence, attempts at cell division with unresolved joint molecules and 
residual cohesin lead to severe recombination-induced meiotic catastrophe.
