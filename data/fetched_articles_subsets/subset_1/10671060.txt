Hereditary multiple exostoses is a dominantly inherited disease characterized by 
multiple benign osteochondromas. The affected individuals have an increased risk 
of developing sarcoma. A large Finnish family with hereditary multiple exostosis 
was analyzed to find the disease-causing mutation. Blood samples were obtained 
from 35 family members, including 21 affected and 14 unaffected individuals. 
Using 2-point linkage analysis the EXT phenotype was shown to be linked to the 
recently cloned EXT2 gene on chromosome 11p11. The coding region of the gene was 
sequenced and a previously unreported splice site mutation found. This G to T 
transversion within a 5-prime splice donor site following exon 6 was shown to 
cause aberrant splicing of RNA. The described change is considered to be a novel 
disease-causing mutation in the EXT2 gene.
