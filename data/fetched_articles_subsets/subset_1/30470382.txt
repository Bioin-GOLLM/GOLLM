OBJECTIVE: To determine whether multiple daily injections of parathyroid 
hormone (PTH) 1-34 are safe and effective as long-term therapy for children with 
hypoparathyroidism.
STUDY DESIGN: Linear growth, bone accrual, renal function, and mineral 
homeostasis were studied in a long-term observational study of PTH 1-34 
injection therapy in 14 children.
METHODS: Subjects were 14 children with hypoparathyroidism attributable to 
autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (N = 5, ages 7-12 years) or calcium 
receptor mutation (N = 9, ages 7-16 years). Mean daily PTH 1-34 dose was 
0.75 ± 0.15 µg/kg/day. Treatment duration was 6.9 ± 3.1 years (range 1.5-10 
years). Patients were evaluated semiannually at the National Institutes of 
Health Clinical Center.
RESULTS: Mean height velocity and lumbar spine, whole body, and femoral neck 
bone accretion velocities were normal throughout the study. In the first 2 
years, distal one-third radius bone accrual velocity was reduced compared with 
normal children (P < .003). Serum alkaline phosphatase correlated with PTH 1-34 
dose (P < .006) and remained normal (235.3 ± 104.8 [SD] U/L, N: 51-332 U/L). 
Mean serum and 24-hour urine calcium levels were 2.05 ± 0.11 mmol/L (N: 
2.05-2.5 mmol/L) and 6.93 ± 1.3 mmol/24 hour (N: 1.25-7.5 mmol/24 hour), 
respectively-with fewer high urine calcium levels vs baseline during calcitriol 
and calcium treatment (P < .001). Nephrocalcinosis progressed in 5 of 12 
subjects who had repeated renal imaging although renal function remained normal.
CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily or thrice-daily subcutaneous PTH 1-34 injections 
provided safe and effective replacement therapy for up to 10 years in children 
with hypoparathyroidism because of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 or 
calcium receptor mutation.
