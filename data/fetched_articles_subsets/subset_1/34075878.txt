High spliceosome activity is a dependency for cancer cells, making them more 
vulnerable to perturbation of the splicing machinery compared to normal cells. 
To identify splicing factors important for prostate cancer (PCa) fitness, we 
performed pooled shRNA screens in vitro and in vivo. Our screens identified 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (HNRNPM) as a regulator of PCa cell 
growth. RNA- and eCLIP-sequencing identified HNRNPM binding to transcripts of 
key homeostatic genes. HNRNPM binding to its targets prevents aberrant exon 
inclusion and backsplicing events. In both linear and circular mis-spliced 
transcripts, HNRNPM preferentially binds to GU-rich elements in long flanking 
proximal introns. Mimicry of HNRNPM-dependent linear-splicing events using 
splice-switching-antisense-oligonucleotides was sufficient to inhibit PCa cell 
growth. This suggests that PCa dependence on HNRNPM is likely a result of 
mis-splicing of key homeostatic coding and non-coding genes. Our results have 
further been confirmed in other solid tumors. Taken together, our data reveal a 
role for HNRNPM in supporting cancer cell fitness. Inhibition of HNRNPM activity 
is therefore a potential therapeutic strategy in suppressing growth of PCa and 
other solid tumors.
