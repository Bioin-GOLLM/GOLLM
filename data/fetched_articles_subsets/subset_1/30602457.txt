Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive malignant brain tumor with 
fatal outcome. Tumor-associated macrophages and microglia (TAMs) have been found 
to be major tumor-promoting immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Hence, 
modulation and reeducation of tumor-associated macrophages and microglia in GBM 
is considered a promising antitumor strategy. Resident microglia and invading 
macrophages have been shown to have distinct origin and function. Whereas yolk 
sac-derived microglia reside in the brain, blood-derived monocytes invade the 
central nervous system only under pathological conditions like tumor formation. 
We recently showed that disruption of the SIRPα-CD47 signaling axis is 
efficacious against various brain tumors including GBM primarily by inducing 
tumor phagocytosis. However, most effects are attributed to macrophages 
recruited from the periphery but the role of the brain resident microglia is 
unknown. Here, we sought to utilize a model to distinguish resident microglia 
and peripheral macrophages within the GBM-TAM pool, using orthotopically 
xenografted, immunodeficient, and syngeneic mouse models with genetically 
color-coded macrophages (Ccr2RFP) and microglia (Cx3cr1GFP). We show that even 
in the absence of phagocytizing macrophages (Ccr2RFP/RFP), microglia are 
effector cells of tumor cell phagocytosis in response to anti-CD47 blockade. 
Additionally, macrophages and microglia show distinct morphological and 
transcriptional changes. Importantly, the transcriptional profile of microglia 
shows less of an inflammatory response which makes them a promising target for 
clinical applications.
