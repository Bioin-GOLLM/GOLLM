BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) involves diverse histologies and 
several remodeling patterns. Ring finger protein 213 (RNF213) c.14576G>A variant 
(rs112735431), recently reported to be associated with ICAS, may be linked with 
negative remodeling (outer diameter - reducing morphological alteration) of 
intracranial arteries. This study investigated the outer diameter of 
atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery (MCA).
METHODS: Patients with unilateral atherosclerotic MCA stenosis/occlusion were 
enrolled in this single-hospital-based case-control study at The University of 
Tokyo Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups by the presence of 
RNF213 c.14576G>A (variant group and wild-type group) and the outer diameter of 
the MCA was measured with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with the wild type and 19 patients with the 
variant type were included. The outer diameter of the stenotic side MCA was 
smaller in the variant group than in the wild-type group (P = 8.3 × 10-6). The 
outer diameter of the normal side MCA was also smaller in the variant group than 
in the wild-type group (P = 5.2 × 10-3). The ratio of stenotic side to normal 
side was also smaller in the variant group than in the wild-type group (P = 1.5 
× 10-5).
CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that RNF213 c.14576G>A is associated with 
negative remodeling of ICAS.
