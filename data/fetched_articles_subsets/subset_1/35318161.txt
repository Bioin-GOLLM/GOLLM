Protein kinase D (PRKD) family kinases are required for formation and function 
of osteoclasts. However, the substrates of PRKD in osteoclasts are unknown. To 
identify PRKD-dependent protein phosphorylation in osteoclasts, we performed a 
quantitative LC-MS/MS phosphoproteomics screen for proteins showing differential 
phosphorylation in osteoclasts after treatment with the PRKD inhibitor 
CRT0066101. We identified 757 phosphopeptides showing significant changes 
following PRKD inhibition. Among the changes, we found a group of 13 proteins 
showing decreased phosphorylation at PRKD consensus phosphorylation motifs. This 
group includes histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), which is a previously validated 
PRKD target. Considering this known interaction, work suggesting HDACs may be 
important regulators of osteoclasts, and studies suggesting potential functional 
redundancy between HDACs, we further investigated the relationship between PRKD 
and class IIa HDACs in osteoclasts. We confirmed that CRT0066101 inhibits 
phosphorylation of endogenous HDAC5 and to a lesser extent HDAC4, whereas HDAC7 
phosphorylation was not affected. Osteoclast cultures from Hdac5 global knockout 
mice displayed impaired differentiation and reduced ability to resorb bone, 
while conditional knockout of Hdac4 in osteoclasts showed no phenotype in vitro 
or in vivo. The inhibitory effect of CRT0066101 was reduced in Hdac5 KO 
osteoclasts. Together these data indicate that the PRKD/HDAC5 axis contributes 
to osteoclast formation in vitro and suggest that this pathway may contribute to 
regulation of skeletal dynamics in vivo.
