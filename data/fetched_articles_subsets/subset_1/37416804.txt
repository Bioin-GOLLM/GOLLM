In Brazil, the use of Eucalyptus is focused on the production of wood or pulp 
for the paper industry but without any general recovery of waste, with leaves 
and branches being left on the ground. One possibility is to use these residues 
as raw materials in the production of industrially relevant and value-added 
compounds such as essential oil. The aim of the present study was to investigate 
the chemical composition, yield, anti-inflammatory/antinociceptive activities, 
and acute toxicity in mice, as well as the antimicrobial effects of essential 
oils from the leaves of 7 varieties of Eucalyptus and hybrids against 
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The extraction of 
oils was carried out using hydrodistillation, and they were analyzed by gas 
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Urocam and Grancam were the plants 
that obtained the highest oil yield, with yields of 3.32 and 2.30%, 
respectively. The main chemical components identified in these plants were 1.8 
cineole and α-pinene. The antinociceptive effect of the 7 oils (50 mg/kg, p.o.) 
was initially assessed in the acetic acid-induced writhing test. In this assay, 
a significant (p < 0.05) antinociceptive/anti-inflammatory effect was observed 
from 4 tested essential oils (E. benthamii, E. saligna, and the hybrids Urocam 
and Grancam) when compared to the vehicle-treated group. This effect was then 
confirmed in the formalin-induced paw licking test. No toxicological effects or 
alterations were observed in motor coordination after the administration of the 
studied oils to the animals. In the antimicrobial evaluation, the seven 
essential oils inhibited the growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans at 
different concentrations. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the 
essential oil from the leaves and branches of Eucalyptus species and varieties 
present potential biomedical applications and represent a source of 
antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory compounds.
