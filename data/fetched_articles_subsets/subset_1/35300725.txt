Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the 
elderly worldwide. However, the complexity of AD pathogenesis leads to 
discrepancies in the understanding of this disease, and may be the main reason 
for the failure of AD drug development. Fortunately, many ongoing preclinical 
and clinical studies will continually open up avenues to unravel disease 
mechanisms and guide strategies for AD diagnosis and drug development. For 
example, immunotherapeutic strategies targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins 
were once deemed almost certainly effective in clinical treatment due to the 
excellent preclinical results. However, the repeated failures of clinical trials 
on vaccines and humanized anti-Aβ and anti-tau monoclonal antibodies have 
resulted in doubts on this strategy. Recently, a new anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 
(Aducanumab) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, which 
brings us back to the realization that immunotherapy strategies targeting Aβ may 
be still promising. Meanwhile, immunotherapies based on other targets such as 
tau, microglia and gut-brain axis are also under development. Further research 
is still needed to clarify the forms and epitopes of targeted proteins to 
improve the accuracy and effectiveness of immunotherapeutic drugs. In this 
review, we focus on the immunotherapies based on Aβ, tau and microglia and their 
mechanisms of action in AD. In addition, we present up-to-date advances and 
future perspectives on immunotherapeutic strategies for AD.
