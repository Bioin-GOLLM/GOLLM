AIMS: This research aims to systematically review the current clinical evidence 
of the efficacy of mobile phone reminders on retention to care among HIV 
patients. This study also seeks to determine an effect size of the intervention 
and presents implications for future studies.
BACKGROUND: Use of mobile technologies is an innovative and affordable approach 
to HIV prevention and care, particularly in resource limited settings. 
Approximately two-thirds of people who are initially diagnosed with HIV are lost 
to follow-up before starting HIV treatment in low and middle-income countries, 
posing serious global health concerns. While mobile text message reminders for 
HIV medication adherence have shown positive health outcomes, it is not well 
understood whether the reminders can also improve patients' retention to care.
METHODS: The authors conducted a meta-analysis of literature in the following 
databases: PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Web of Science. Of the 667 
peer-reviewed research articles reviewed, nine studies were included in the 
final analysis. Stata version 13 was used for the analysis.
RESULTS: Nine studies (5 randomized controlled and 4 before and after studies) 
from 7 countries included 3,004 HIV patients. Random-effect meta-analysis 
(I-squared = 94.1%) found that HIV patients who received mobile phone reminders 
for their follow-up appointments were two times more likely to return to care 
than those who didn't receive reminders (pooled odd ratio (OR)=2.04, 95% CI: 
0.97-4.27). Our sub-group analysis of 5 randomized controlled studies showed a 
significant effect of mobile phone reminders (OR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.11-3.74). Six 
studies in Africa showed that HIV patients (mostly women) receiving mobile phone 
reminders were three times more likely to return to care than those who received 
no reminders (OR=2.92, 95% CI: 1.13-7.53).
CONCLUSION: Mobile phone reminders are an effective intervention to improve 
retention to HIV care. Women with HIV living in resource limited settings 
benefit significantly from the intervention. Also, mobile phone reminders using 
text messages are as effective as phone calls to improve retention to HIV care.
