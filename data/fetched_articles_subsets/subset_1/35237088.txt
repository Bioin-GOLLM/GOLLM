BACKGROUND: While the fast extension of combination antiretroviral therapy 
(cART) has resulted in significant increases in life expectancy, disorders such 
as cardiometabolic syndrome (CMetS), which have received less attention, are 
becoming a major concern in HIV/AIDS patients (PLWHA).
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research was to identify biomarkers and 
determine the prevalence of CMetS in PLWHA using the National Cholesterol 
Education Program (NCEP) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) tools.
METHODS: Between January 2019 and February 2021, a hospital-based study of 
HIV-infected patients (n = 288) was conducted. The data were analyzed using 
binary logistic regression. To control the effect of confounders, independent 
variables with a P-value of <.20 in the bivariate logistic regression were 
incorporated into multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance was 
defined as a 95% confidence interval and a P-value of less than .05.
RESULTS: The risk of CMetS increased twofold as age increased each year 
(P = .009), 1.2 times as the age at which cART began increased (P = .015), and 6 
times with 1 or more co-morbidities (P = .028), according to the NCEP tool. 
Furthermore, significant NCEP-CMetS correlations were produced by a rise in 
diastolic blood pressure (P < .001) and cART duration (P = .006). Male gender 
was 99.9% less likely to be related to CMetS using the IDF tool, and the risk of 
CMetS increased fourfold with each unit increase in waist circumference 
(P < .001). Triglycerides and blood type "A" have been found to have substantial 
relationships with CMetS using both techniques.
CONCLUSION: According to the study, CMetS was found to be common in PLWHA. Age, 
time on cART, age when cART started, gender, co-morbidities, waist 
circumference, and diastolic blood pressure were all revealed to be significant 
predictors of CMetS. Triglycerides and blood type "A" were the only biomarkers 
found to be significant with CMetS using both the NCEP and IDF tools.
