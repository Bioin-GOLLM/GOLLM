The need to test anticancer drugs in multiple indications has been addressed by 
basket trials, which are Phase I or II clinical trials involving multiple tumor 
subtypes and a single master protocol. Basket trials typically involve few 
patients per type, making it challenging to rigorously compare responses across 
types. We describe the use of permutation testing to test for differences among 
subgroups using empirical null distributions and the Benjamini-Hochberg 
procedure to control for false discovery. We apply the approach retrospectively 
to tumor-volume changes and progression-free survival in published basket trials 
for neratinib, larotrectinib, pembrolizumab, and imatinib and uncover examples 
of therapeutic benefit missed by conventional binomial testing. For example, we 
identify an overlooked opportunity for use of neratinib in lung cancers carrying 
ERBB2 Exon 20 mutations. Permutation testing can be used to design basket trials 
but is more conservatively introduced alongside established approaches to 
enrollment such as Simon's two-stage design.
