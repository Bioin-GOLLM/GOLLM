Topoisomerase IIIα is a type 1A topoisomerase that forms a complex with RMI1 and 
RMI2 called TRR in human cells. TRR plays an essential role in resolving DNA 
replication and recombination intermediates, often alongside the helicase BLM. 
While the TRR catalytic cycle is known to involve a protein-mediated 
single-stranded (ss)DNA gate, the detailed mechanism is not fully understood. 
Here, we probe the catalytic steps of TRR using optical tweezers and 
fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that TRR forms an open gate in ssDNA of 
8.5 ± 3.8 nm, and directly visualize binding of a second ssDNA or 
double-stranded (ds)DNA molecule to the open TRR-ssDNA gate, followed by 
catenation in each case. Strikingly, dsDNA binding increases the gate size (by 
~16%), while BLM alters the mechanical flexibility of the gate. These findings 
reveal an unexpected plasticity of the TRR-ssDNA gate size and suggest that 
TRR-mediated transfer of dsDNA may be more relevant in vivo than previously 
believed.
