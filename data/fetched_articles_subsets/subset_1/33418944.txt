Bladder cancer is a very heterogeneous disease and the molecular mechanisms of 
carcinogenesis and progression are insufficiently investigated. From the DNA 
sequencing analysis of matched non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) samples from eight patients, we identified 
the tumour-associated gene SLC35F2 to be mutated in the 5' and 3' untranslated 
region (UTR). One mutation in 3'UTR increased the luciferase activity reporter, 
suggesting its influence on the protein expression of SLC35F2. The mRNA level of 
SLC35F2 was increased in MIBC compared with NMIBC. Furthermore, in 
immunohistochemical staining, we observed a strong intensity of SLC35F2 in 
single tumour cells and in the border cells of solid tumour areas with an 
atypical accumulation around the nucleus, especially in the MIBC. This suggests 
that SLC35F2 might be highly expressed in aggressive and invasive tumour cells. 
Moreover, knockdown of SLC35F2 repressed the growth of bladder cancer cells in 
the monolayer and spheroid model and suppressed migration and invasion of 
bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, we suggest that SLC35F2 is involved in 
bladder cancer progression and might provide a new therapeutic approach, for 
example, by the anti-cancer drug YM155, a cargo of the SLC35F2 transporter.
