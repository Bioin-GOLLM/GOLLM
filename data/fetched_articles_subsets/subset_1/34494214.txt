OBJECTIVES: The association of interleukin-6 (IL-6) -174G/C (rs1800795) and IL-6 
-572G/C (rs1800796) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with the risk of 
acquiring rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was inconsistent among previous studies. 
This paper aims to investigate the association between IL-6 promoter 
polymorphism with RA in different ethnics.
METHODS: Relevant studies were searched using Medline and Google Search engines; 
STATA software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) 
were calculated to estimate the potential genetic associations. Subgroup 
analysis and sensitivity analysis were applied to explore the sources of 
heterogeneity. Lastly, we used TSA (trial sequential analysis) software to 
verify the reliability of meta-analysis results.
RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included, involving 8116 subjects (3820 RA 
patients and 4296 controls). We found a tendency to associate RA with the IL-6 
-174G/C allele in Asians (C vs G: OR = 4.56, 95% CI = 1.85-11.23; P < 0.001); 
with IL-6 -572G/C genotype or allele frequencies, there was no statistical 
differences between RA patients and controls (P > 0.05). TSA results indicate 
that the current meta-analysis can draw conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-6-174G/C gene polymorphism were associated with increased risk 
of RA in Asians, but not in Caucasians. There was no association between IL-6 
-572G/C gene polymorphism and the risk of RA. Key Points • Although the 
association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) promoter polymorphism and rheumatic 
arthritis (RA) has been discussed in the previous meta-analysis, their 
conclusions are inconsistent. • In this study, trial sequential analysis (TSA) 
was introduced into the meta-analysis, and the following two important 
conclusions were confirmed: (1) IL-6-174G/C gene polymorphism was associated 
with increased risk of RA in Asians, but not in Caucasians. (2) There was no 
association between IL-6 -572G/C gene polymorphism and the risk of RA.
