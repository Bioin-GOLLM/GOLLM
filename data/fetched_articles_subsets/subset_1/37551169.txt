BACKGROUND: Venomous arthropods have substances in their venom with 
antiproliferative potential for neoplastic cells.
OBJECTIVES: To identify a polypeptide from Myrmeleon bore (antlion) with 
antiproliferative activity against neoplastic cells, and to elucidate the 
molecular mechanism of the activity.
METHODS: We used gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography to purify a 
polypeptide with antiproliferative activity against MG-63 human osteosarcoma 
cells from a proteinaceous extract of antlion. The polypeptide was sequenced and 
the stability of its antiproliferative activity was tested under a range of 
conditions in vitro. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the antiproliferative activity of the 
polypeptide against the MG-63 osteosarcoma cells and MC3T3-E1 mouse calvarial 
osteoblasts, which were used as a non-neoplastic control. We used western 
blotting to compare the levels of expression of heat shock transcription factor 
1 (HSF1), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and 
protein kinase B alpha (ATK1) in MG-63 osteosarcoma cells and their mouse 
homologs in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts after their treatment with the antlion 
antiproliferative polypeptide (ALAPP).
RESULTS: The 85-amino-acid ALAPP has a 56% sequence identity with the human heat 
shock factor binding protein 1 (HSBP1). The antiproliferative activity of the 
polypeptide is relatively insensitive to temperature, pH, and metal ions. ALAPP 
has a strong concentration-dependent antiproliferative activity against MG-63 
osteosarcoma cells compared with its effect on MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. ALAPP 
significantly upregulates the expression of HSF1 in MC3T3-EL osteoblasts, but 
not in MG-63 osteosarcoma. ALAPP significantly downregulated the expression of 
HSP90, CDK4, and AKT1 expression in MG-63 osteosarcoma, but not in the 
osteoblasts.
CONCLUSIONS: ALAPP has significant antiproliferative activity against MG-63 
osteosarcoma cells, but not nonneoplastic MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. We speculate 
that non-neoplastic cells may evade the antiproliferative effect of ALAPP by 
upregulating HSF1 to maintain their HSP90, CDK4, and AKT1 expression at a 
relatively constant level.
