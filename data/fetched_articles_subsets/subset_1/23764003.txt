Despite success with BRAFV600E inhibitors, therapeutic responses in patients 
with metastatic melanoma are short-lived because of the acquisition of drug 
resistance. We identified a mechanism of intrinsic multidrug resistance based on 
the survival of a tumor cell subpopulation. Treatment with various drugs, 
including cisplatin and vemurafenib, uniformly leads to enrichment of 
slow-cycling, long-term tumor-maintaining melanoma cells expressing the 
H3K4-demethylase JARID1B/KDM5B/PLU-1. Proteome-profiling revealed an 
upregulation in enzymes of mitochondrial oxidative-ATP-synthesis (oxidative 
phosphorylation) in this subpopulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration 
blocked the emergence of the JARID1B(high) subpopulation and sensitized melanoma 
cells to therapy, independent of their genotype. Our findings support a 
two-tiered approach combining anticancer agents that eliminate rapidly 
proliferating melanoma cells with inhibitors of the drug-resistant slow-cycling 
subpopulation.
