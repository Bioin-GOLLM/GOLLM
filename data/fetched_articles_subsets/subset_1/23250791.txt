Hippocalcin, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) subclass of the 
calmodulin superfamily, serves as an important calcium sensor for the slow 
afterhyperpolarizing (sAHP) current in the hippocampus, which underlies some 
forms of learning and memory. Hippocalcin is also a calcium sensor for 
hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) and genetically linked to 
neurodegenerative diseases. We report NMR chemical shift assignments of 
Ca(2+)-free hippocalcin (BMRB no. 18627).
