PURPOSE: This report discusses a case of North Carolina macular dystrophy (NCMD) 
in a 7-year-old boy initially diagnosed as congenital toxoplasmosis. Genetic 
testing was performed on the child and his family after the suspicion of NCMD 
was raised by the treating ophthalmologist. This case report highlights the 
similarities between congenital toxoplasmosis and NCMD.
METHODS: DNA was collected from the family with consent and underwent 
comparative genomic hybridization and Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Genetic testing identified a previously reported single base 
substitution (chromosome 6: 99,593,111 (G>C) 
NC_000006.11(GRCh38):g.100040987G>C), which confirms a diagnosis of NCMD.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe this is the first confirmed case of NCMD in Australia. 
This case highlights the similarities between NCMD and more commonly recognized 
conditions, such as ocular toxoplasmosis, and raises the question; How many 
other cases are misdiagnosed as ocular toxoplasmosis?
