Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is highly activated in Alzheimer disease (AD) and is 
associated with neurofibrillary tangles formation. Phosphorylated SET, a potent 
PP2A inhibitor, mediates tau hyperphosphorylation in AD. However, whether CK2 
phosphorylates SET and regulates tau pathological phosphorylation in AD remains 
unclear. Here, we show that CK2 phosphorylating SET at Ser9 induced tau 
hyperphosphorylation in AD. We found that either AÎ² treatment or tau 
overexpression stimulated CK2 activation leading to SET Ser9 
hyperphosphorylation in neurons and animal models, while inhibition of CK2 by 
TBB abolished this event. Overexpression of CK2 in mouse hippocampus via virus 
injection induced cognitive deficit associated with SET Ser9 
hyperphosphorylation. Injection of SET Ser9 phosphorylation mimetic mutant 
induced tau pathology and behavior impairments. Conversely co-injection of 
non-phosphorylated SET S9A with CK2 abolished the CK2 overexpression-induced AD 
pathology and cognitive deficit. Together, our data demonstrate that CK2 
phosphorylates SET at Ser9 leading to SET cytoplasmic translocation and 
inhibition of PP2A resulting in tau pathology and cognitive impairments.
