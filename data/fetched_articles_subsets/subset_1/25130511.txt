BACKGROUND: Antiviral resistance development is a serious complication of human 
cytomegalovirus virostatic therapy caused by mutations in UL 97 and/or UL54 
genes.
OBJECTIVES: To determinate the presence of sensitive and resistant strains in 
patients developing antiviral resistance.
STUDY DESIGN: We used three different molecular biological methods for mutation 
analysis-restriction fragment length polymorphism, sequencing and real-time PCR 
approach.
RESULTS: We describe three allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
patients developing the GCV resistant HCMV strains manifested by virostatic 
treatment failure. In these patients we identified UL97 mutations L595S, A594V 
and A594T and monitored the dynamics of coexisted sensitive/resistant strains. 
We confirmed the presence of mixed HCMV populations and in two patients a 
phenomenon of sensitive strain repopulation which occurred after 6.5 months and 
1 month after removing GCV pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show changes in proportions of sensitive/resistant 
subpopulations over time but other studies would be required to demonstrate the 
beneficial impact of their monitoring on clinical outcome.
