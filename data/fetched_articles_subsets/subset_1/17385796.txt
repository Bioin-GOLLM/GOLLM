OBJECTIVE: The prenatal genetic diagnosis and counseling of oculocutaneous 
albinism type II (OCA2) by detecting mutations in the OCA2 gene
METHODS: DNA samples were extracted from peripheral whole blood and 
amniocentesis-derived cells. Polymerase chain reaction and automatic sequence 
analysis were used to screen the OCA2 gene.
RESULTS: Case 1: Two novel heterozygous mutations (p.N476D and p.Y827H) in the P 
gene were detected in the proband. Molecular prenatal diagnosis on fetal DNA 
revealed N476D. The pregnancy progressed uneventfully to a normal outcome. Case 
2: Mutation analysis of the DNA of family 2 revealed compound heterozygosities 
for two novel P gene mutations (p.N476D and p.G775R). The pregnant female and 
the fetus each presented with a single P gene mutation (p.V443I and G775R, 
respectively). The pregnancy was continued.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of prenatal diagnosis performed in families 
with oculocutaneous albinism type II (OCA2). Also, this report reveals three 
novel mutations of the P gene.
