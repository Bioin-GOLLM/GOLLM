BACKGROUND: It has been shown that low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 1B (LRP1B) mutations correlate with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and 
prognosis in patients with melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, while the 
relationship between LRP1B mutations and TMB in gastric cancer needs further 
study. This study is aimed at exploring the relationship between LRP1B mutations 
and TMB in gastric cancer.
METHODS: Mutation frequency profiles of the genes in patients with gastric 
cancer in TCGA-STAD dataset were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis. The 
relationship among LRP1B mutations, TMB, and patient clinical features in 
gastric cancer was investigated by the chi-square test. The TMB prediction 
capacity based on LRP1B mutation status was evaluated by ROC curves.
RESULTS: LRP1B is one of the top 10 genes with high gene mutation frequency in 
gastric cancer. The mutation status of LRP1B in gastric cancer patients was 
significantly correlated with age and TP53 and MUC16 mutation status. The result 
of ROC curve analysis revealed that the mutation status of LRP1B could be 
considered as an indicator of the degree of TMB in patients with gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study presented the relationship between TMB and LRP1B 
mutations in gastric cancer, providing a novel perspective for gastric cancer 
prognosis and therapy.
