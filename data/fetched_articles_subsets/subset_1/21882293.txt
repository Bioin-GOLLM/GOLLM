DICER1 is crucial for embryogenesis and early development. Forty different 
heterozygous germline DICER1 mutations have been reported worldwide in 42 
probands that developed as children or young adults, pleuropulmonary blastoma 
(PPB), cystic nephroma (CN), ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (especially 
Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor [SLCT]), and/or multinodular goiter (MNG). We report 
DICER1 mutations in seven additional families that manifested uterine cervix 
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (cERMS, four cases) and primitive neuroectodermal 
tumor (cPNET, one case), Wilms tumor (WT, three cases), pulmonary sequestration 
(PS, one case), and juvenile intestinal polyp (one case). One carrier developed 
(age 25 years) a pleomorphic sarcoma of the thigh; another carrier had 
transposition of great arteries (TGA). These observations show that cERMS, 
cPNET, WT, PS, and juvenile polyps fall within the spectrum of DICER1-related 
diseases. DICER1 appears to be the first gene implicated in the etiology of 
cERMS, cPNET, and PS. Young adulthood sarcomas and perhaps congenital 
malformations such as TGA may also be associated.
