Evidence that KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2) Receptors may Perceive an Unknown 
Signal that is not Karrikin or Strigolactone.

The α/β-hydrolases KAI2 and D14 are paralogous receptors for karrikins and 
strigolactones, two classes of plant growth regulators with butenolide moieties. 
KAI2 and D14 act in parallel signaling pathways that share a requirement for the 
F-box protein MAX2, but produce distinct growth responses by regulating 
different members of the SMAX1-LIKE/D53 family. kai2 and max2 mutants share seed 
germination, seedling growth, leaf shape, and petiole orientation phenotypes 
that are not found in d14 or SL-deficient mutants. This implies that KAI2 
recognizes an unknown, endogenous signal, herein termed KAI2 ligand (KL). Recent 
studies of ligand-specificity among KAI2 paralogs in basal land plants and root 
parasitic plants suggest that karrikin and strigolactone perception may be 
evolutionary adaptations of KL receptors. Here we demonstrate that 
evolutionarily conserved KAI2c genes from two parasite species rescue multiple 
phenotypes of the Arabidopsis kai2 mutant, unlike karrikin-, and 
strigolactone-specific KAI2 paralogs. We hypothesize that KAI2c proteins 
recognize KL, which could be an undiscovered hormone.
