Introns of human transfer RNA precursors (pre-tRNAs) are excised by the tRNA 
splicing endonuclease TSEN in complex with the RNA kinase CLP1. Mutations in 
TSEN/CLP1 occur in patients with pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), however, 
their role in the disease is unclear. Here, we show that intron excision is 
catalyzed by tetrameric TSEN assembled from inactive heterodimers independently 
of CLP1. Splice site recognition involves the mature domain and the 
anticodon-intron base pair of pre-tRNAs. The 2.1-Å resolution X-ray crystal 
structure of a TSEN15-34 heterodimer and differential scanning fluorimetry 
analyses show that PCH mutations cause thermal destabilization. While 
endonuclease activity in recombinant mutant TSEN is unaltered, we observe 
assembly defects and reduced pre-tRNA cleavage activity resulting in an 
imbalanced pre-tRNA pool in PCH patient-derived fibroblasts. Our work defines 
the molecular principles of intron excision in humans and provides evidence that 
modulation of TSEN stability may contribute to PCH phenotypes.
