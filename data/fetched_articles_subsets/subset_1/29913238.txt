Beta-thalassemia (β-thalassemia) is a globally genetic diseases, and is most 
prevalent in the Middle East, particularly in Iran. Carrier detection and 
prenatal diagnosis are the best ways to managing it, and to prevent new 
community cases from emerging. We report on a simple method for rapid detection 
of the worst β-thalassemia point mutation in Iran (IVS-II-1 G>A), using a 
nano-based ligation assay, this was performed using probes with labeled magnetic 
nanoparticles and quantum dots. After optimizing the technique, 50 DNA samples 
were genotyped with this method. We found a frequency of 72% for IVSII-1 (G˃A) 
mutation (42% heterozygote, and 30% mutant homozygote) with a highly sensitive 
nano-based ligation genotyping system, offering excellent sensitivity and 
specificity for point mutation detection; it has been demonstrated to be 
inaccurate, sensitive, cost-effective, and rapid technique for single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.
