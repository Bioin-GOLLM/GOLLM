Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is the synthase that generates the second 
messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) upon DNA binding. cGAS was first discovered as 
the cytosolic DNA sensor that detects DNA exposed in the cytoplasm either from 
pathogens or cellular damage. Activated cGAS instigates the signaling cascades 
to activate type I interferon (IFN) expression, critical for host defense and 
autoimmune diseases. In addition, cGAS plays a role in senescence, DNA repair, 
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Recently, various post-translational modifications 
(PTMs) of cGAS have been reported, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, 
acetylation, glutamylation, and sumoylation. These PTMs profoundly affect cGAS 
functions. Thus, here we review the recent reported PTMs of cGAS and how these 
PTMs regulate cGAS enzymatic activity, DNA binding, and protein stability, and 
discuss the potential future directions.
