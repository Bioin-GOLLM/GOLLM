BACKGROUND: Inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene are the main cause of 
Gitelman's syndrome (GS), a renal tubular disorder inherited as an autosomal 
recessive trait. In our cohort of patients, we identified 11 probands from 11 
apparently unrelated Italian families that carry the c.1196_1202dup7bp mutation, 
which appears to be more frequent than other mutations in Italian GS patients. 
Therefore, we characterized in greater detail the SLC12A3 locus and its vicinity 
in those patients that carry this mutation in order to detect a possible shared 
haplotype. Three further probands characterized in France, carrying the same 
mutation, were also included in this study.
METHODS: Sequence or fragment analyses were carried out to investigate seven 
intragenic polymorphisms (rs3217425, rs3816119, rs2304483, rs2278490, rs2278489, 
rs2289116 and rs2289115) that flank the mutation, as well as two extragenic 
markers, D16S3071 and D16S3057, flanking the SLC12A3 locus in the 5' and 3' 
termini, respectively.
RESULTS: A shared haplotype co-segregates with the mutation both in Italian and 
French probands. Moreover, all the Italian families originate from a restricted 
area of Italy. Likewise, the French probands come from an area of France close 
to the north of Italy.
CONCLUSION: It is likely that the c.1196_1202dup7bp mutation in the SLC12A3 gene 
reflects the presence of a common ancestor in an area covering the 
northern-central part of Italy and eastern France. A modified genotyping 
strategy for GS patients originating from this area has to be considered.
