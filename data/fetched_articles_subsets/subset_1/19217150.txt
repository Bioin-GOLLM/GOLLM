A key function of blood vessels, to supply oxygen, is impaired in tumors because 
of abnormalities in their endothelial lining. PHD proteins serve as oxygen 
sensors and may regulate oxygen delivery. We therefore studied the role of 
endothelial PHD2 in vessel shaping by implanting tumors in PHD2(+/-) mice. 
Haplodeficiency of PHD2 did not affect tumor vessel density or lumen size, but 
normalized the endothelial lining and vessel maturation. This resulted in 
improved tumor perfusion and oxygenation and inhibited tumor cell invasion, 
intravasation, and metastasis. Haplodeficiency of PHD2 redirected the 
specification of endothelial tip cells to a more quiescent cell type, lacking 
filopodia and arrayed in a phalanx formation. This transition relied on 
HIF-driven upregulation of (soluble) VEGFR-1 and VE-cadherin. Thus, decreased 
activity of an oxygen sensor in hypoxic conditions prompts endothelial cells to 
readjust their shape and phenotype to restore oxygen supply. Inhibition of PHD2 
may offer alternative therapeutic opportunities for anticancer therapy.
