BACKGROUND: Substance use is heritable, but few common genetic variants have 
been associated with these behaviors. Rare nonsynonymous exonic variants can now 
be efficiently genotyped, allowing exome-wide association tests. We identified 
and tested 111,592 nonsynonymous exonic variants for association with behavioral 
disinhibition and the use/misuse of nicotine, alcohol, and illicit drugs.
METHODS: Comprehensive genotyping of exonic variation combined with 
single-variant and gene-based tests of association was conducted in 7181 
individuals; 172 candidate addiction genes were evaluated in greater detail. We 
also evaluated the aggregate effects of nonsynonymous variants on these 
phenotypes using Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis.
RESULTS: No variant or gene was significantly associated with any phenotype. No 
association was found for any of the 172 candidate genes, even at reduced 
significance thresholds. All nonsynonymous variants jointly accounted for 35% of 
the heritability in illicit drug use and, when combined with common variants 
from a genome-wide array, accounted for 84% of the heritability.
CONCLUSIONS: Rare nonsynonymous variants may be important in etiology of illicit 
drug use, but detection of individual variants will require very large samples.
