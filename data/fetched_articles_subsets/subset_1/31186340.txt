BACKGROUND: The 5α-reductase type 2 (5α-RD2) deficiency caused by mutations in 
the steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2) gene results in variable degrees of 
undervirilisation in patients with 46,XY disorders of sex development. This 
study aims to profile the regional distribution and phenotype-genotype 
characteristics of SRD5A2 in a large Chinese 5α-RD2 deficiency cohort through 
multi-centre analysis.
METHODS: 190 subjects diagnosed with 5α-RD2 deficiency were consecutively 
enrolled from eight medical centres in China. Their clinical manifestations and 
genetic variants were analysed.
RESULTS: Hypospadias (isolated or combined with microphallus and/or 
cryptorchidism) was fairly common in the enrolled subjects (66.32%). 42 
variants, including 13 novel variants, were identified in SRD5A2. Homozygous and 
compound heterozygous mutations presented in 38.42% and 61.58% of subjects, 
respectively, and predominated in exons 1, 4 and 5. The most prevalent variant 
was c.680G > A (52.37%), followed by c.16C > T, (10.79%), c.607G > A, (9.21%) 
and c.737G > A, (8.95%). However, their distributions were different: c.680G > A 
was more common in South China than in North China (62.62% vs 39.16%, p < 
0.001), whereas the regional prevalence of c.16C > T was reversed (6.07% vs 
16.87%, p = 0.001). Furthermore, c.680G > A prevailed in cases with normal 
meatus (68.75%) or distal hypospadias (66.28%), compared with those with 
proximal hypospadias (35.54%, p < 0.001). However, cases with proximal 
hypospadias showed a higher frequency of c.16C > T (20.48%) than those with 
normal meatus (3.13%) or distal hypospadias (3.49%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study profiled variable phenotypic presentation and wide 
mutational spectrum of SRD5A2, revealing its distinctive regional distribution 
in Chinese patients and further shaping the founder effect and 
genotype-phenotype correlation of SRD5A2.
