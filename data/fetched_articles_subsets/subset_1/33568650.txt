Tissue-resident macrophages are highly specialized to their tissue-specific 
microenvironments, activated by various inflammatory signals and modulated by 
genetic and environmental factors. Osteoclasts and microglia are distinct 
tissue-resident cells of the macrophage lineage in bone and brain that are 
responsible for pathological changes in osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), respectively. Osteoporosis is more frequently observed in individuals with 
AD compared to the prevalence in general population. Diagnosis of AD is often 
delayed until underlying pathophysiological changes progress and cause 
irreversible damages in structure and function of brain. As such earlier 
diagnosis and intervention of individuals at higher risk would be indispensable 
to modify clinical courses. Pleiotropy is the phenomenon that a genetic variant 
affects multiple traits and the genetic correlation between two traits could 
suggest a shared molecular mechanism. In this review, we discuss that the 
Pyk2-mediated actin polymerization pathway in osteoclasts and microglia in bone 
and brain, respectively, is the horizontal pleiotropic mediator of shared risk 
factors for osteoporosis and AD.
