The goal of this review article is to provide a resource for longitudinal 
studies, using animal models, directed at understanding and modifying the 
relationship between cognition and brain structure and function throughout life. 
We propose that forthcoming longitudinal studies will build upon a wealth of 
knowledge gleaned from prior cross-sectional designs to identify early 
predictors of variability in cognitive function during aging, and characterize 
fundamental neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the vulnerability to, and 
the trajectory of, cognitive decline. Finally, we present examples of biological 
measures that may differentiate mechanisms of the cognitive reserve at the 
molecular, cellular, and network level.
