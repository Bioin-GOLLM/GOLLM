Recently, the global incidence of gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) 
cancer has remained high. China is also a large country with a high gastric 
cancer (GC) incidence rate, where the cases of GC account for 40% of all cases 
worldwide. More than 90% of GEJ cancers are the adenocarcinoma pathological 
type. Patients with early-stage G/GEJ adenocarcinoma may have a better prognosis 
after surgery. In contrast, patients with advanced metastatic G/GEJ 
adenocarcinoma usually choose comprehensive treatment based on systemic 
pharmacotherapy, but the subsequent long-term survival is not optimistic. The 
discovery of various biomarkers, especially microsatellite instability (MSI), 
programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2), tumor mutational burden (TMB) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), has led to 
the identification of an increasing number of targeted populations and has 
greatly improved the clinical efficacy of treatments for G/GEJ adenocarcinoma. 
The ToGA trial added trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy, showed improved 
survival of patients with HER2-positive advanced G/GEJ adenocarcinoma and 
brought these patients into a new era of HER2-targeted therapy. Moreover, many 
HER2-targeted agents have been developed and studied in patients with advanced 
HER2-positive G/GEJ adenocarcinoma who have demonstrated excellent clinical 
outcomes. However, many patients experience disease progression with 
HER2-targeted therapy; hence, new anti-HER2 drugs keep being developed, 
significantly reducing HER2 resistance. This paper reviews HER2-targeted drugs 
for advanced metastatic G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, potential resistance mechanisms 
and future directions.
