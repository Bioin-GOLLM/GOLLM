Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a fast-growing area of research that 
combine approaches in synthetic biology and material science. Here, we engineer 
B. subtilis to become a living component of a silica material composed of 
self-assembling protein scaffolds for functionalization and cross-linking of 
cells. B. subtilis is engineered to display SpyTags on polar flagella for cell 
attachment to SpyCatcher modified secreted scaffolds. We engineer endospore 
limited B. subtilis cells to become a structural component of the material with 
spores for long-term storage of genetic programming. Silica biomineralization 
peptides are screened and scaffolds designed for silica polymerization to 
fabricate biocomposite materials with enhanced mechanical properties. We show 
that the resulting ELM can be regenerated from a piece of cell containing silica 
material and that new functions can be incorporated by co-cultivation of 
engineered B. subtilis strains. We believe that this work will serve as a 
framework for the future design of resilient ELMs.
