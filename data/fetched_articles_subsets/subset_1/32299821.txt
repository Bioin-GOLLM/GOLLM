PURPOSE: To determine whether a multianalyte liquid biopsy can improve the 
detection and staging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed plasma from 204 subjects (71 healthy, 44 
non-PDAC pancreatic disease, and 89 PDAC) for the following biomarkers: 
tumor-associated extracellular vesicle miRNA and mRNA isolated on a nanomagnetic 
platform that we developed and measured by next-generation sequencing or qPCR, 
circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) concentration measured by qPCR, ccfDNA KRAS 
G12D/V/R mutations detected by droplet digital PCR, and CA19-9 measured by 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. We applied machine learning to training 
sets and subsequently evaluated model performance in independent, user-blinded 
test sets.
RESULTS: To identify patients with PDAC versus those without, we generated a 
classification model using a training set of 47 subjects (20 PDAC and 27 
noncancer). When applied to a blinded test set (N = 136), the model achieved an 
AUC of 0.95 and accuracy of 92%, superior to the best individual biomarker, 
CA19-9 (89%). We next used a cohort of 20 patients with PDAC to train our model 
for disease staging and applied it to a blinded test set of 25 patients 
clinically staged by imaging as metastasis-free, including 9 subsequently 
determined to have had occult metastasis. Our workflow achieved significantly 
higher accuracy for disease staging (84%) than imaging alone (accuracy = 64%; P 
< 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Algorithmically combining blood-based biomarkers may improve PDAC 
diagnostic accuracy and preoperative identification of nonmetastatic patients 
best suited for surgery, although larger validation studies are necessary.
