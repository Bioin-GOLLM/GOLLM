Carotid body tumors represent the most common of head and neck tumors. They 
account for <0.03% of all human tumors. The underlying physiology and 
pathogenesis of this tumor type are not well understood. Several different 
genetic abnormalities have been associated with the development of carotid body 
paragangliomas. We present a case report with an unusual genetic mutation in the 
SDHB gene and a review of the paraganglioma syndromes.
