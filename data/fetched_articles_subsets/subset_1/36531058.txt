With the development of technologies, multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) has 
been detected more frequently. Although large-scale genomics studies have made 
significant progress, the aberrant gene mutation in MPLC is largely unclear. In 
this study, 141 and 44 lesions from single and multiple primary lung 
adenocarcinoma (SP- and MP-LUAD) were analyzed. DNA and RNA were extracted from 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue and sequenced by using the 
next-generation sequencing-based YuanSu450TM gene panel. We systematically 
analyzed the clinical features and gene mutations of these lesions, and found 
that there were six genes differently mutated in MP-LUAD and SP-LUAD lesions, 
including RBM10, CDK4, ATRX, NTRK1, PREX2, SS18. Data from the cBioPortal 
database indicated that mutation of these genes was related to some clinical 
characteristics, such as TMB, tumor type, et al. Besides, heterogeneity analysis 
suggested that different lesions could be tracked back to monophyletic 
relationships. We compared the mutation landscape of MP-LUAD and SP-LUAD and 
identified six differentially mutated genes (RBM10, CDK4, ATRX, NTRK1, PREX2, 
SS18), and certain SNV loci in TP53 and EGFR which might play key roles in 
lineage decomposition in multifocal samples. These findings may provide insight 
into personalized prognosis prediction and new therapies for MP-LUAD patients.
