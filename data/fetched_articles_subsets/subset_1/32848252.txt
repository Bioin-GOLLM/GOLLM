At the end of mitosis, eukaryotic cells must segregate the two copies of their 
replicated genome into two new nuclear compartments1. They do this either by 
first dismantling and later reassembling the nuclear envelope in an 'open 
mitosis' or by reshaping an intact nucleus and then dividing it into two in a 
'closed mitosis'2,3. Mitosis has been studied in a wide variety of eukaryotes 
for more than a century4, but how the double membrane of the nuclear envelope is 
split into two at the end of a closed mitosis without compromising the 
impermeability of the nuclear compartment remains unknown5. Here, using the 
fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (a classical model for closed mitosis5), 
genetics, live-cell imaging and electron tomography, we show that nuclear 
fission is achieved via local disassembly of nuclear pores within the narrow 
bridge that links segregating daughter nuclei. In doing so, we identify the 
protein Les1, which is localized to the inner nuclear envelope and restricts the 
process of local nuclear envelope breakdown to the bridge midzone to prevent the 
leakage of material from daughter nuclei. The mechanism of local nuclear 
envelope breakdown in a closed mitosis therefore closely mirrors nuclear 
envelope breakdown in open mitosis3, revealing an unexpectedly high conservation 
of nuclear remodelling mechanisms across diverse eukaryotes.
