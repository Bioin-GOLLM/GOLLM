Engineered skeletal muscle tissues have been proposed as potential solutions for 
volumetric muscle losses, and biologic scaffolds have been obtained by 
decellularization of animal skeletal muscles. The aim of the present work was to 
analyse the characteristics of a biologic scaffold obtained by decellularization 
of human skeletal muscles (also through comparison with rats and rabbits) and to 
evaluate its integration capability in a rabbit model with an abdominal wall 
defect. Rat, rabbit and human muscle samples were alternatively decellularized 
with two protocols: n.1, involving sodium deoxycholate and DNase I; n.2, 
trypsin-EDTA and Triton X-NH4OH. Protocol 2 proved more effective, removing all 
cellular material and maintaining the three-dimensional networks of collagen and 
elastic fibers. Ultrastructural analyses with transmission and scanning electron 
microscopy confirmed the preservation of collagen, elastic fibres, 
glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. Implantation of human scaffolds in rabbits 
gave good results in terms of integration, although recellularization by muscle 
cells was not completely achieved. In conclusion, human skeletal muscles may be 
effectively decellularized to obtain scaffolds preserving the architecture of 
the extracellular matrix and showing mechanical properties suitable for 
implantation/integration. Further analyses will be necessary to verify the 
suitability of these scaffolds for in vitro recolonization by autologous cells 
before in vivo implantation.
