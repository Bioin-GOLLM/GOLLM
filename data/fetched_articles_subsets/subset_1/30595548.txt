The Parkinson disease (PD) genetic LRRK2 gain-of-function mutations may relate 
to the ER pathological changes seen in PD patients at postmortem. Human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons with the PD pathogenic LRRK2 G2019S 
mutation exhibited neurite collapse when challenged with the ER Ca2+ influx 
sarco/ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (THP). Baseline ER Ca2+ levels 
measured with the ER Ca2+ indicator CEPIA-ER were lower in LRRK2 G2019S human 
neurons, including in differentiated midbrain dopamine neurons in vitro. After 
THP challenge, PD patient-derived neurons displayed increased Ca2+ influx and 
decreased intracellular Ca2+ buffering upon membrane depolarization. These 
effects were reversed following LRRK2 mutation correction by antisense 
oligonucleotides and gene editing. Gene expression analysis in LRRK2 G2019S 
neurons identified modified levels of key store-operated Ca2+ entry regulators, 
with no alterations in ER Ca2+ efflux. These results demonstrate PD gene 
mutation LRRK2 G2019S ER calcium-dependent pathogenic effects in human neurons.
