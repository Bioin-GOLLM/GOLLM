In the current model of the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera (PV), the 
JAK2V617F mutation arises in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that maintain the 
disease, while erythroid precursor populations expand, resulting in excessive 
red blood cell production. We examined the role of these specific cell 
populations using a conditional Jak2V617F knockin murine model. We demonstrate 
that the most immature long-term (LT) HSCs are solely responsible for initiating 
and maintaining the disease in vivo and that Jak2V617F mutant LT-HSCs dominate 
hematopoiesis over time. When we induced Jak2V617F expression in erythropoietin 
receptor expressing precursor cells, the mice developed elevated hematocrit, 
expanded erythroid precursors, and suppressed erythropoietin levels. However, 
the disease phenotype was significantly attenuated compared with mice expressing 
Jak2V617F in LT-HSCs. In addition to developing a PV phenotype, all mice 
transplanted with Jak2V617F LT-HSCs underwent myelofibrotic transformation over 
time. These findings recapitulate the development of post-PV myelofibrosis in 
human myeloproliferative neoplasms. In aggregate, these results demonstrate the 
distinct roles of LT-HSCs and erythroid precursors in the pathogenesis of PV.
