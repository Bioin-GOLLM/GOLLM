Activating BRAF mutants and fusions signal as RAS-independent constitutively 
active dimers with the exception of BRAF V600 mutant alleles which can function 
as active monomers1. Current RAF inhibitors are monomer selective, they potently 
inhibit BRAF V600 monomers but their inhibition of RAF dimers is limited by 
induction of negative cooperativity when bound to one site in the dimer1-3. 
Moreover, acquired resistance to these drugs is usually due to molecular lesions 
that cause V600 mutants to dimerize4-8. We show here that PLX8394, a new RAF 
inhibitor9, inhibits ERK signaling by specifically disrupting BRAF-containing 
dimers, including BRAF homodimers and BRAF-CRAF heterodimers, but not CRAF 
homodimers or ARAF-containing dimers. Differences in the amino acid residues in 
the amino (N)-terminal portion of the kinase domain of RAF isoforms are 
responsible for this differential vulnerability. As a BRAF-specific dimer 
breaker, PLX8394 selectively inhibits ERK signaling in tumors driven by dimeric 
BRAF mutants, including BRAF fusions and splice variants as well as BRAF V600 
monomers, but spares RAF function in normal cells in which CRAF homodimers can 
drive signaling. Our work suggests that drugs with these properties will be safe 
and useful for treating tumors driven by activating BRAF mutants or fusions.
