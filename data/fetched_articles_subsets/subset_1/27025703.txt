Here, we applied optoRAF, an optogenetic tool for light-controlled clustering 
and activation of RAF proteins that mimics the natural occurring RAS-mediated 
dimerization. This versatile tool allows studying the effect on BRAF and CRAF 
homodimer- as well as heterodimer-induced RAF signaling. Vemurafenib and 
dabrafenib are two clinically approved inhibitors for BRAF that efficiently 
suppress the kinase activity of oncogenic BRAF (V600E). However in wild-type 
BRAF expressing cells, BRAF inhibitors can exert paradoxical activation of 
wild-type CRAF. Using optoRAF, vemurafenib was identified as paradoxical 
activator of BRAF and CRAF homo- and heterodimers. Dabrafenib enhanced activity 
of light-stimulated CRAF at low dose and inhibited CRAF signaling at high dose. 
Moreover, dabrafenib increased the protein level of CRAF proteins but not of 
BRAF proteins. Increased CRAF levels correlate with elevated RAF signaling in a 
dabrafenib-dependent manner, independent of light activation.
