BACKGROUND: mTOR signaling is an essential nutrient and energetic sensing 
pathway. Here we describe AIMTOR, a sensitive genetically encoded BRET 
(Bioluminescent Resonance Energy Transfer) biosensor to study mTOR activity in 
living cells.
RESULTS: As a proof of principle, we show in both cell lines and primary cell 
cultures that AIMTOR BRET intensities are modified by mTOR activity changes 
induced by specific inhibitors and activators of mTORC1 including amino acids 
and insulin. We further engineered several versions of AIMTOR enabling 
subcellular-specific assessment of mTOR activities. We then used AIMTOR to 
decipher mTOR signaling in physio-pathological conditions. First, we show that 
mTORC1 activity increases during muscle cell differentiation and in response to 
leucine stimulation in different subcellular compartments such as the cytosol 
and at the surface of the lysosome, the nucleus, and near the mitochondria. 
Second, in hippocampal neurons, we found that the enhancement of neuronal 
activity increases mTOR signaling. AIMTOR further reveals mTOR-signaling 
dysfunctions in neurons from mouse models of autism spectrum disorder.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results demonstrate that AIMTOR is a sensitive and 
specific tool to investigate mTOR-signaling dynamics in living cells and 
phenotype mTORopathies.
