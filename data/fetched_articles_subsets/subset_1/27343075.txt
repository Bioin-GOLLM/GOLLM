BACKGROUND: Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) is an important veterinary 
pathogen that can cause severe diseases in a wide range of mammals and birds. 
The global regulator crp gene has been found to regulate the virulence of some 
bacteria, and crp mutants have been demonstrated to be effective attenuated 
vaccines against Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Here, we first 
characterized the crp gene in P. multocida, and we report the effects of a crp 
deletion.
RESULTS: The P. multocida crp mutant exhibited a similar lipopolysaccharide and 
outer membrane protein profile but displayed defective growth and serum 
complement resistance in vitro compared with the parent strain. Furthermore, crp 
deletion decreased virulence but did not result in full attenuation. The 50 % 
lethal dose (LD50) of the Δcrp mutant was 85-fold higher than that of the parent 
strain for intranasal infection. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that 
92 genes were up-regulated and 94 genes were down-regulated in the absence of 
the crp gene. Finally, we found that intranasal immunization with the Δcrp 
mutant triggered both systematic and mucosal antibody responses and conferred 
60 % protection against virulent P. multocida challenge in ducks.
CONCLUSION: The deletion of the crp gene has an inhibitory effect on bacterial 
growth and bacterial resistance to serum complement in vitro. The P. multocida 
crp mutant was attenuated and conferred moderate protection in ducks. This work 
affords a platform for analyzing the function of crp and aiding the formulation 
of a novel vaccine against P. multocida.
