Binding of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) to its cognate receptor 
(PDGFR) promotes lens epithelial cell (LEC) proliferation and migration. After 
cataract surgery, these LEC behaviors have been proposed as an influential cause 
of posterior capsule opacification (PCO). Stimulated PDFGR undergoes 
dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation providing docking sites for a 
SH2-domain-containing noncatalytic region of tyrosine kinase (Nck). Nck is an 
adaptor protein acting as a linker of the proximal and downstream signaling 
events. However, the functions of Nck1 protein in LEC have not been investigated 
so far. We reported here a crucial role of Nck1 protein in regulating 
PDGFR-mediated LEC activation using LEC with a silenced expression of Nck1 
protein. The knockdown of Nck1 suppressed PDGF-BB-stimulated LEC proliferation 
and migration and disrupted the cell cycle progression especially G1/S 
transition. LEC lacking Nck1 protein failed to exhibit actin polymerization and 
membrane protrusions. The downregulation of Nck1 protein in LEC impaired 
PDGFR-induced phosphorylation of intracellular signaling proteins, including 
Erk1/2, Akt, CREB and ATF1, which resulted in inhibition of LEC responses. 
Therefore, these data suggest that the loss of Nck1 expression may disturb LEC 
activation and Nck1 may potentially be a drug target to prevent PCO and 
lens-related disease.
