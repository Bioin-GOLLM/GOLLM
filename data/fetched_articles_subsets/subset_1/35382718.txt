BACKGROUND: Wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) is characterized by the 
presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Although there are some clinical 
drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibiting CNV, 
two major side effects limit their application, including the excessive activity 
of anti-VEGF and frequent intraocular injections. To explore better treatment 
strategies, researchers developed a hypoxic modulator retinal pigment epithelium 
(RPE)- specific adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing endostatin to 
inhibit CNV. However, the mechanism of endostatin is complex. Instead, soluble 
fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) can inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis 
through two simple and clear mechanisms, giving rise to sequestration of VEGF 
and forming an inactive heterodimer with the membrane-spanning isoforms of the 
VEGF receptor Flt-1 and kinase insert domain-containing receptor.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we chose sFlt-1 as a safer substitute to treat wAMD by 
inhibiting VEGFinduced angiogenesis.
METHODS: The AAV2/8-Y733F-REG-RPE-sFlt-1 vector was delivered by intravitreal 
injection to the eyes of mice. AAV2/8-Y733F vector is a mutant of the AAV2/8 
vector, and the REG-RPE promoter is a hypoxia-regulated RPE-specific promoter. 
Two animal models were used to evaluate the function of the vector.
RESULTS: In the cobalt chloride-induced hypoxia model, the results demonstrated 
that the AAV2/8- Y733F-REG-RPE-sFlt-1 vector induced the expression of the 
sFlt-1 gene in RPE cells through hypoxia. In the laser-induced CNV model, the 
results demonstrated that the AAV2/8-Y733F-REG-RPE-sFlt- 1 vector reduced 
laser-induced CNV.
CONCLUSION: Hypoxia regulated, RPE-specific AAV vector-mediated sFlt-1 gene is a 
hypoxiaregulated antiangiogenic vector for wAMD.
