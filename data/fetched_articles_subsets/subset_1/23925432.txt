Human islet transplantation is an effective and promising therapy for type I 
diabetes. However, long-term insulin independence is both difficult to achieve 
and inconsistent. De novo or early administration of incretin-based drugs is 
being explored for improving islet engraftment. In addition to its 
glucose-dependent insulinotropic effects, incretins also lower postprandial 
glucose excursion by inhibiting glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, 
and can protect beta-cell function. Incretin therapy has so far proven 
clinically safe and tolerable with little hypoglycemic risk. The present review 
aims to highlight the new frontiers in research involving incretins from both in 
vitro and in vivo animal studies in the field of islet transplant. It also 
provides an overview of the current clinical status of incretin usage in islet 
transplantation in the management of type I diabetes.
