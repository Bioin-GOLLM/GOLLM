Among eutherian (placental) mammals, placental embedding into the maternal 
endometrium exhibits great differences, from being deeply invasive (e.g., 
humans) to noninvasive (e.g., cattle). The degree of invasion of placental 
trophoblasts is positively correlated with the rate of cancer malignancy. 
Previously, we have shown that fibroblasts from different species offer 
different levels of resistance to the invading trophoblasts as well as to cancer 
cell invasion. Here we present a comparative genomic investigation revealing 
cis-regulatory elements underlying these interspecies differences in 
invasibility. We identify transcription factors that regulate proinvasibility 
and antiinvasibility genes in stromal cells. Using an in vitro invasibility 
assay combined with CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout, we found that the transcription 
factors GATA2 and TFDP1 strongly influence the invasibility of endometrial and 
skin fibroblasts. This work identifies genomic mechanisms explaining species 
differences in stromal invasibility, paving the way to therapies targeting 
stromal characteristics to regulate placental invasion, wound healing, and 
cancer dissemination.
