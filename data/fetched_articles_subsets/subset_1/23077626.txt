BACKGROUND: The CYP2E1 and GSTM1 genes encode metabolic enzymes that have key 
functions in drug modification and elimination.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the possible effects of CYP2E1 
and GSTM1 polymorphisms in 71 leprosy patients and in 110 individuals from the 
general population. The GSTM1*0 null allele and INDEL CYP2E1*1D mutant genotypes 
were analyzed by conventional PCR, while CYP2E1 SNPs (1053C>T, 1293G>C and 
7632T>A) were determined by RT-PCR. In leprosy patients, the GSTM1*0 and 
CYP2E1*5 alleles and the combined alleles GSTM1*0/CYP2E1*6 and GSTM1*0/CYP2E1*5 
were significantly related to a baciloscopic index (BI) (BI<3), while the 
CYP2E1*6 allele was related to a better clinical evolution in the leprosy 
spectrum.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Therefore, GSTM1*0, CYP2E1*5 and CYP2E1*6 may be 
possible protection factors for leprosy patients.
