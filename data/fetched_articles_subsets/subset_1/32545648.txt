Molecular signaling pathways play a significant role in the regulation of 
biological mechanisms, and their abnormal expression can provide the conditions 
for cancer development. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) is a key member of the STAT proteins and its oncogene role in cancer has 
been shown. STAT3 is able to promote the proliferation and invasion of cancer 
cells and induces chemoresistance. Different downstream targets of STAT3 have 
been identified in cancer and it has also been shown that microRNA (miR), long 
non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and other molecular pathways are able to function as 
upstream mediators of STAT3 in cancer. In the present review, we focus on the 
role and regulation of STAT3 in gastric cancer (GC). miRs and lncRNAs are 
considered as potential upstream mediators of STAT3 and they are able to affect 
STAT3 expression in exerting their oncogene or onco-suppressor role in GC cells. 
Anti-tumor compounds suppress the STAT3 signaling pathway to restrict the 
proliferation and malignant behavior of GC cells. Other molecular pathways, such 
as sirtuin, stathmin and so on, can act as upstream mediators of STAT3 in GC. 
Notably, the components of the tumor microenvironment that are capable of 
targeting STAT3 in GC, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, are discussed in 
this review. Finally, we demonstrate that STAT3 can target oncogene factors to 
enhance the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells.
