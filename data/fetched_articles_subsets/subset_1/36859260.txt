BACKGROUND: Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a common nonlethal skeletal dysplasia 
caused by pathogenic variations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 
(FGFR3) gene, and HCH has similar clinical manifestations with achondroplasia 
(ACH), which can be screened during the fetal period by prenatal ultrasound 
testing and diagnosed by genetic testing.
CASE PRESENTATION: we report the special case of a patient with obvious growth 
retardation and rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, accompanied by other 
manifestations, including an enlarged head and short hands at 1 year old. 
However, several multiple color ultrasound exams identified shortened limbs 
(< 3rd percentile), an increased biparietal diameter (> 95th percentile) and a 
low nasal bridge in the fetal period. Due to the high incidence rate of ACH, 
genetic testing for the hotspot FGFR3 gene c.1138 g > A pathogenic variations 
was performed immediately in the third trimester. Unfortunately, the 
definitive diagnosis could not be made before birth due to the negative result 
of hotspot gene exam. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed at 1 year 
identified FGFR3 gene c.1620C > A variations positivity, and the patient was 
finally diagnosed as HCH.
CONCLUSION: Our report extends the understanding of the limitations of prenatal 
genetic diagnostic testing, especially the hot spot pathogenic variations test 
should be not the only clinical diagnostic basis. Moreover, this case also 
emphasizes that further gene analysis for patients with significant conflict 
between the clinical manifestation and the prenatal genetic panel examination 
findings should be reconducted timely to spare the family from a delayed 
diagnosis or a misdiagnosis.
