When microorganisms invade a host, the innate immune system first recognizes the 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns of these microorganisms through pattern 
recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known transmembrane 
PRRs existing in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Upon ligand recognition, 
TLRs initiate a cascade of signaling events; promote the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine, type I interferon, and chemokine expression; and play an essential 
role in the modulation of the host's innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, it 
is of great significance to improve our understanding of antimicrobial immune 
responses by studying the role of TLRs and their signal molecules in the host's 
defense against invading microbes. This paper aims to summarize the specificity 
of TLRs in recognition of conserved microbial components, such as lipoprotein, 
lipopolysaccharide, flagella, endosomal nucleic acids, and other bioactive 
metabolites derived from microbes. This set of interactions helps to elucidate 
the immunomodulatory effect of TLRs and the signal transduction changes involved 
in the infectious process and provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat 
microbial infections.
