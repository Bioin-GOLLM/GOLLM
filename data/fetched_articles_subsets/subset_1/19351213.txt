BACKGROUND AND AIM: The human serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) transporter, 
encoded by the SLC6A4 gene on chromosome 17q11.1-q12, is the cellular reuptake 
site for serotonin and a site of action for several drugs with central nervous 
system effects, including both therapeutic agents (e.g. antidepressants) and 
drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine). It is known that the serotonin transporter plays 
an important role in the metabolic cycle of a broad range of antidepressants, 
antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antiemetics, and antimigraine drugs. The 
identification and characterization of variations that increase the response to 
common medications is a challenging and increasingly important task with regard 
to prediction of drug response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to 
establish a high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) screening 
method for two polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene, focusing on the 
SLC6A4 variations rs140701 and rs2066713.
METHODS: We developed a classical restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) PCR protocol as a reference, followed by a new protocol established for 
the LightCycler real-time PCR method. To validate the method, the allele 
frequencies in 169 individuals (112 women, 57 men) were determined and compared 
with published data. The population was divided into two groups: one group 
comprised 87 individuals with various mental disorders and the other consisted 
of 82 healthy persons.
RESULTS: No difference was found in the prevalence of the two SNPs between the 
two populations. Subsequently, the determined allele frequencies were compared 
with previously published data. We found that 68% of the whole study population 
(groups I and II) carried a mutated allele of the rs140701 variation. With 
regard to the rs2066713 polymorphism, we found an allele frequency of 61% in the 
population. Both results are consistent with published data.
CONCLUSION: The developed protocol for RT-PCR analysis of both variations turned 
out to be reliable and economical, and thus suitable for routine laboratory use.
