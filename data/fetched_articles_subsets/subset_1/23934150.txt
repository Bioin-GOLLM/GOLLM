The N-terminal acetylation of Sir3 is essential for heterochromatin 
establishment and maintenance in yeast, but its mechanism of action is unknown. 
The crystal structure of the N-terminally acetylated BAH domain of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae Sir3 bound to the nucleosome core particle reveals that the 
N-terminal acetylation stabilizes the interaction of Sir3 with the nucleosome. 
Additionally, we present a new method for the production of protein-nucleosome 
complexes for structural analysis.
