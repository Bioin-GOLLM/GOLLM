BACKGROUND: To inform effective genomic medicine strategies, it is important to 
examine current approaches and gaps in well-established applications. Lynch 
syndrome (LS) causes 3-5% of colorectal cancers (CRCs). While guidelines 
commonly recommend LS tumour testing of all CRC patients, implementation in 
health systems is known to be highly variable. To provide insights on the 
heterogeneity in practice and current bottlenecks in a high-income country with 
universal healthcare, we characterise the approaches and gaps in LS testing and 
referral in seven Australian hospitals across three states.
METHODS: We obtained surgery, pathology, and genetics services data for 1,624 
patients who underwent CRC resections from 01/01/2017 to 31/12/2018 in the 
included hospitals.
RESULTS: Tumour testing approaches differed between hospitals, with 0-19% of 
patients missing mismatch repair deficiency test results (total 211/1,624 
patients). Tumour tests to exclude somatic MLH1 loss were incomplete at five 
hospitals (42/187 patients). Of 74 patients with tumour tests completed 
appropriately and indicating high risk of LS, 36 (49%) were missing a record of 
referral to genetics services for diagnostic testing, with higher missingness 
for older patients (0% of patients aged ≤ 40 years, 76% of patients aged > 70 
years). Of 38 patients with high-risk tumour test results and genetics services 
referral, diagnostic testing was carried out for 25 (89%) and identified a LS 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant for 11 patients (44% of 25; 0.7% of 1,624 
patients).
CONCLUSIONS: Given the LS testing and referral gaps, further work is needed to 
identify strategies for successful integration of LS testing into clinical care, 
and provide a model for hereditary cancers and broader genomic medicine. 
Standardised reporting may help clinicians interpret tumour test results and 
initiate further actions.
