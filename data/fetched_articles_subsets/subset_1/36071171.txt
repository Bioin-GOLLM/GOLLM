Many genetic variants affect disease risk by altering context-dependent gene 
regulation. Such variants are difficult to study mechanistically using current 
methods that link genetic variation to steady-state gene expression levels, such 
as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address this challenge, we 
developed the cistrome-wide association study (CWAS), a framework for 
identifying genotypic and allele-specific effects on chromatin that are also 
associated with disease. In prostate cancer, CWAS identified regulatory elements 
and androgen receptor-binding sites that explained the association at 52 of 98 
known prostate cancer risk loci and discovered 17 additional risk loci. CWAS 
implicated key developmental transcription factors in prostate cancer risk that 
are overlooked by eQTL-based approaches due to context-dependent gene 
regulation. We experimentally validated associations and demonstrated the 
extensibility of CWAS to additional epigenomic datasets and phenotypes, 
including response to prostate cancer treatment. CWAS is a powerful and 
biologically interpretable paradigm for studying variants that influence traits 
by affecting transcriptional regulation.
