Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. However, it is not well known 
how metabolism affects cancer progression. We identified that metabolic enzyme 
acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1) suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC) progression by 
regulating palmitic acid (PA) reprogramming. ACOX1 is highly downregulated in 
CRC, which predicts poor clinical outcome in CRC patients. Functionally, ACOX1 
depletion promotes CRC cell proliferation in vitro and colorectal tumorigenesis 
in mouse models, whereas ACOX1 overexpression inhibits patient-derived xenograft 
growth. Mechanistically, DUSP14 dephosphorylates ACOX1 at serine 26, promoting 
its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby leading to an 
increase of the ACOX1 substrate PA. Accumulated PA promotes β-catenin cysteine 
466 palmitoylation, which inhibits CK1- and GSK3-directed phosphorylation of 
β-catenin and subsequent β-Trcp-mediated proteasomal degradation. In return, 
stabilized β-catenin directly represses ACOX1 transcription and indirectly 
activates DUSP14 transcription by upregulating c-Myc, a typical target of 
β-catenin. Finally, we confirmed that the DUSP14-ACOX1-PA-β-catenin axis is 
dysregulated in clinical CRC samples. Together, these results identify ACOX1 as 
a tumor suppressor, the downregulation of which increases PA-mediated β-catenin 
palmitoylation and stabilization and hyperactivates β-catenin signaling thus 
promoting CRC progression. Particularly, targeting β-catenin palmitoylation by 
2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) can efficiently inhibit β-catenin-dependent tumor growth 
in vivo, and pharmacological inhibition of DUSP14-ACOX1-β-catenin axis by 
Nu-7441 reduced the viability of CRC cells. Our results reveal an unexpected 
role of PA reprogramming induced by dephosphorylation of ACOX1 in activating 
β-catenin signaling and promoting cancer progression, and propose the inhibition 
of the dephosphorylation of ACOX1 by DUSP14 or β-catenin palmitoylation as a 
viable option for CRC treatment.
