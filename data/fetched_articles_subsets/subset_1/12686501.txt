Human integrin alpha4beta1 (VLA-4) is thought to play a key role in immune 
responses. Only two variants of alpha4-subunit (alpha4-tex and alpha4-mas) have 
been described until now, and the information regarding these variants is 
scanty. In this study, we measured the frequency of both variants in healthy 
blood donors (n=252). Surprisingly, the frequency of alpha4-mas (3061G, 0.31) 
was lower than that of alpha4-tex (3061A, 0.69). In addition, we sequenced and 
analyzed the mRNA of the entire alpha4-subunit in eight unselected healthy blood 
donors. These studies revealed three new variants, including a C to A 
transversion at position 269 in the promoter region of exon 1 (accession no. 
AJ504733); a G to A transversion at position 2273 in exon 16 (accession no. 
AJ510246, AJ510247), and a T to C exchange at position 3311 in exon 26 
(accession no. AJ510248, AJ510249). None of these variants led to amino acid 
(AA) substitutions. Interestingly, homozygosity of the new variant 269A was not 
found.
