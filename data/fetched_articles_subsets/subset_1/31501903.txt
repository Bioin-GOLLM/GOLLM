Axon pathfinding and synapse formation are essential processes for nervous 
system development and function. The assembly of myelinated fibres and nodes of 
Ranvier is mediated by a number of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily including neurofascin, encoded by the NFASC gene, and its 
alternative isoforms Nfasc186 and Nfasc140 (located in the axonal membrane at 
the node of Ranvier) and Nfasc155 (a glial component of the paranodal axoglial 
junction). We identified 10 individuals from six unrelated families, exhibiting 
a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized with a spectrum of central 
(intellectual disability, developmental delay, motor impairment, speech 
difficulties) and peripheral (early onset demyelinating neuropathy) neurological 
involvement, who were found by exome or genome sequencing to carry one 
frameshift and four different homozygous non-synonymous variants in NFASC. 
Expression studies using immunostaining-based techniques identified absent 
expression of the Nfasc155 isoform as a consequence of the frameshift variant 
and a significant reduction of expression was also observed in association with 
two non-synonymous variants affecting the fibronectin type III domain. Cell 
aggregation studies revealed a severely impaired Nfasc155-CNTN1/CASPR1 complex 
interaction as a result of the identified variants. Immunofluorescence staining 
of myelinated fibres from two affected individuals showed a severe loss of 
myelinated fibres and abnormalities in the paranodal junction morphology. Our 
results establish that recessive variants affecting the Nfasc155 isoform can 
affect the formation of paranodal axoglial junctions at the nodes of Ranvier. 
The genetic disease caused by biallelic NFASC variants includes 
neurodevelopmental impairment and a spectrum of central and peripheral 
demyelination as part of its core clinical phenotype. Our findings support 
possible overlapping molecular mechanisms of paranodal damage at peripheral 
nerves in both the immune-mediated and the genetic disease, but the observation 
of prominent central neurological involvement in NFASC biallelic variant 
carriers highlights the importance of this gene in human brain development and 
function.
