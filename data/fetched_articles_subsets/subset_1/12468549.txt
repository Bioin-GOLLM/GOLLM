Nuclear hormone receptors coordinately regulate the activity of genetic networks 
through the recruitment of transcriptional co-regulators, including 
co-repressors and co-activators. Allosteric modulation of the ligand-binding 
domain by hormonal activators shifts the co-factor binding preference by defined 
structural changes in overlapping docking sites. We report here that mutations 
at conserved residues within the docking motif of the retinoic acid receptor 
alpha cause defects in dimerization, co-regulator association, and 
transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, although a minimal co-repressor 
receptor interaction domain is sufficient for receptor binding, flanking 
sequences appear to stabilize this interaction without interfering with ligand 
sensitivity. However, ligand sensitivity is changed by the K262A mutation, which 
requires much higher concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid to promote 
co-repressor dissociation. Consequently, K262A functions as a dominant-negative 
mutant at low concentrations of all-trans-retinoic acid. As a result, 
transcriptional activation is mechanistically linked to co-repressor release.
