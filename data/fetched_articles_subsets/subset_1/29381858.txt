The human innate immune system launches a metal-withholding response to starve 
invading microbial pathogens of essential metal nutrients. Zn(II)-sequestering 
proteins of the human S100 family contribute to this process and include 
calprotectin (CP, S100A8/S100A9 oligomer, calgranulin A/B oligomer), S100A12 
(calgranulin C), and S100A7 (psoriasin). This Perspective highlights recent 
advances in the Zn(II) coordination chemistry of these three proteins, as well 
as select studies that evaluate Zn(II) sequestration as an antimicrobial 
mechanism.
