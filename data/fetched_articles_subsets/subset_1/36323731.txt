The present research shows the antitumor activity of a protein-polysaccharide 
complex Venetin-1 obtained from the coelomic fluid of Dendrobaena veneta 
earthworms against A549 cancer cells. The investigations are a continuation of 
experiments on the antitumor activity of coelomic fluid obtained from this 
species. The Venetin-1 nanoparticle was obtained after thermal treatment of the 
coelomic fluid, separation from coelomocytes, filtration, and lyophilization. 
The preparation showed a selective effect on cancer cells, whereas normal cells 
were unaffected. Venetin-1 was effective against the lung cancer cells at doses 
of 31.3 and 62.5 µg/ml, and the results were imaged using light microscopy and 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cells died mainly via the apoptosis 
pathway. Necrotic cells appeared sporadically in the microscopic view. SEM 
imaging revealed complete destruction of the A549 cells after the incubation 
with Venetin-1. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses showed changes in the 
topography, peak force error images, and Young's modulus (elasticity) of the 
A549 cells after the incubation with Venetin-1. The transmission electron 
cryomicroscopy (Cryo-TEM) analysis indicated a polymeric nature of the analyzed 
preparation. The samples of Venetin-1 showed a very homogeneous size profile 
with the microparticle size of approximately 58.23 nm. A significant decrease in 
Venetin-1 binding to sphingomyelin was observed. Venetin-1 lost its pore-forming 
activity or deactivation of the pore-forming activity occurred. This confirms 
the absence of hemolytic capacity of Venetin-1 towards red blood cells. The 
conducted analyses show the suitability of the obtained complex for biomedical 
research. The next step will consist in analyses of the effect of Venetin-1 on 
the immune system in mice.
