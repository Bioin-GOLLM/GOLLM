In 2015, germline mutations in PPP2R1A were found to cause neurodevelopmental 
disorders (NDDs). To date, fewer than 50 cases of PPP2R1A-related NDDs have been 
reported. Here, we report the first Korean case of PPP2R1A-related NDD harboring 
a novel de novo missense PPP2R1A variant with previously unreported clinical 
features. The proband, a 12-month-old female, presented with developmental 
delay, intractable epilepsy, microcephaly, and feeding difficulties. Brain 
magnetic resonance imaging showed a Dandy-Walker continuum with corpus callosum 
hypoplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, and brainstem and diffuse cerebral 
atrophy. Next-generation sequencing-based targeted gene panel testing for NDDs 
revealed a novel heterozygous missense variant of PPP2R1A:c.650A>G, 
p.(Gln217Arg). Sanger sequencing confirmed it as de novo, as neither parent 
carried this variant. These findings expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectra 
of PPP2R1A variants.
