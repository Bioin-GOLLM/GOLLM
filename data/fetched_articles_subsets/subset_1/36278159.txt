Background: Immunotherapy is changing the way we treat cancer. Immunogenic cell 
death (ICD) has received considerable attention in the treatments of various 
cancer types, due to the long-lasting antitumor responses elicited in human 
body. However, to date, no relevant bibliometric research has been reported. 
Methods: Publications related to ICD in cancer research were collected from the 
Web of Science Core Collection. Using CiteSpace, VOSviewer and an online 
platform, the analyses of co-author, co-citation, and co-occurrence of terms 
retrieved from literatures were carried out. Results: A total of 1,577 
publications were included in this study. The global research literatures on ICD 
in cancer research have been increasing from 2005 to 2021. China, the United 
States and France dominated in this area and had close collaborations with many 
countries. Six of the top 10 most contributive institutions were from France. 
When it comes to author analysis, Kroemer G, Zitvogel L, Kepp O, Garg AD and 
Galluzzi L were in both the top 10 most productive authors and top 10 most 
co-cited authors lists. The co-occurring author keywords could be grouped into 
three clusters: "biomarkers of ICD", "nanoparticles" and "combination therapy". 
In terms of promising hotspots, keywords (author keywords and KeyWords Plus) 
with recent citation bursts could be summarized into two aspects: "tumor 
microenvironment" and "nanoparticles". Conclusion: Increased attention has been 
paid to ICD in cancer treatment. However, there are still many unresolved 
domains in the field of ICD, such as clinical application and molecular 
mechanisms of this cell death process. ICD-inducing modalities combined with 
nanotechnology could potentiate the current immunotherapies, and will be 
hotspots for future research.
