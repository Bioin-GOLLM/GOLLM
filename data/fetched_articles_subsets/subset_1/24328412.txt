Tamoxifen reduces the rate of breast cancer recurrence by approximately a half. 
Tamoxifen is metabolized to more active metabolites by enzymes encoded by 
polymorphic genes, including cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Tamoxifen is a 
substrate for ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins. We review tamoxifen's 
clinical pharmacology and use meta-analyses to evaluate the clinical 
epidemiology studies conducted to date on the association between CYP2D6 
inhibition and tamoxifen effectiveness. Our findings indicate that the effect of 
both drug-induced and/or gene-induced inhibition of CYP2D6 activity is likely to 
be null or small, or at most moderate in subjects carrying two reduced function 
alleles. Future research should examine the effect of polymorphisms in genes 
encoding enzymes in tamoxifen's complete metabolic pathway, should 
comprehensively evaluate other biomarkers that affect tamoxifen effectiveness, 
such as the transport enzymes, and focus on subgroups of patients, such as 
premenopausal breast cancer patients, for whom tamoxifen is the only guideline 
endocrine therapy.
