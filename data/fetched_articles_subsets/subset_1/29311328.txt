Genetically engineered pigs play an indispensable role in the study of rare 
monogenic diseases. Pigs harboring a gene responsible for a specific disease can 
be efficiently generated via somatic cell cloning. The generation of somatic 
cell-cloned pigs from male cells with mutation(s) in an X chromosomal gene is a 
reliable and straightforward method for reproducing X-linked genetic diseases 
(XLGDs) in pigs. However, the severe symptoms of XLGDs are often accompanied by 
impaired growth and reproductive disorders, which hinder the reproduction of 
these valuable model animals. Here, we generated unique chimeric boars composed 
of mutant cells harboring a lethal XLGD and normal cells. The chimeric boars 
exhibited the cured phenotype with fertility while carrying and transmitting the 
genotype of the XLGD. This unique reproduction system permits routine production 
of XLGD model pigs through the male-based breeding, thereby opening an avenue 
for translational research using disease model pigs.
