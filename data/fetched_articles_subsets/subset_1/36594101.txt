Cardiovascular and metabolic disease (CVMD) is becoming increasingly prevalent 
in developed and developing countries with high morbidity and mortality. In 
recent years, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has attracted intensive 
research interest due to its purported role as a potential biomarker and 
critical player in CVMDs, including atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, 
myocardial infarction, hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, heart failure, type 2 
diabetes, obesity, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This review summarizes the 
recent developments in investigating the role of FGF21 in CVMDs and explores the 
mechanism whereby FGF21 regulates the development of CVMDs. Novel molecular 
targets and related pathways of FGF21 (adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated 
protein kinase, silent information regulator 1, autophagy-related molecules, and 
gut microbiota-related molecules) are highlighted in this review. Considering 
the poor pharmacokinetics and biophysical properties of native FGF21, the 
development of new generations of FGF21-based drugs has tremendous therapeutic 
potential. Related preclinical and clinical studies are also summarized in this 
review to foster clinical translation. Thus, our review provides a timely and 
insightful overview of the physiology, biomarker potential, molecular targets, 
and therapeutic potential of FGF21 in CVMDs.
