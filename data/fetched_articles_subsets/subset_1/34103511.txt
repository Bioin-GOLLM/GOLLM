To understand the underlying mechanisms of progressive neurophysiological 
phenomena, neural interfaces should interact bi-directionally with brain 
circuits over extended periods of time. However, such interfaces remain limited 
by the foreign body response that stems from the chemo-mechanical mismatch 
between the probes and the neural tissues. To address this challenge, we 
developed a multifunctional sensing and actuation platform consisting of 
multimaterial fibers intimately integrated within a soft hydrogel matrix 
mimicking the brain tissue. These hybrid devices possess adaptive bending 
stiffness determined by the hydration states of the hydrogel matrix. This 
enables their direct insertion into the deep brain regions, while minimizing 
tissue damage associated with the brain micromotion after implantation. The 
hydrogel hybrid devices permit electrophysiological, optogenetic, and behavioral 
studies of neural circuits with minimal foreign body responses and tracking of 
stable isolated single neuron potentials in freely moving mice over 6 months 
following implantation.
