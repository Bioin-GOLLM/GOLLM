Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children. 
Differences are found among ethnic groups in the results of the treatment of 
pediatric ALL. In general, children with a high level of native American 
ancestry tend to respond less positively to ALL treatments, which may be related 
to specific genomic variants found in native American groups. Despite the 
evidence, few data are available on the distribution of the pharmacogenomic 
variants relevant to the treatment of ALL in traditional Amerindian populations, 
such the those of the Amazon region. Given this, the present study investigated 
27 molecular markers related to the treatment of ALL in Amerindians from 
Brazilian Amazonia and compared the frequencies with those recorded previously 
on five continents, that are available in the 1,000 Genomes database. The 
variation in the genotype frequencies among populations was evaluated using 
Fisher's exact test. The False Discovery Rate method was used to correct the 
results of the multiple analyses. Significant differences were found in the 
frequencies of the majority of markers between the Amerindian populations and 
those of other regions around the world. These findings highlight the unique 
genetic profile of the indigenous population of Brazilian Amazonia, which may 
reflect a distinct therapeutic profile for the treatment of ALL in these 
populations.
