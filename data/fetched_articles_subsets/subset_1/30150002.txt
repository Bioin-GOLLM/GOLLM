Linkage mapping - utilizing experimental genetic crosses to examine 
cosegregation of phenotypic traits with genetic markers - is now 100 years old. 
Schistosome parasites are exquisitely well suited to linkage mapping approaches 
because genetic crosses can be conducted in the laboratory, thousands of progeny 
are produced, and elegant experimental work over the last 75 years has revealed 
heritable genetic variation in multiple biomedically important traits such as 
drug resistance, host specificity, and virulence. Application of this approach 
is timely because the improved genome assembly for Schistosoma mansoni and 
developing molecular toolkit for schistosomes increase our ability to link 
phenotype with genotype. We describe current progress and potential future 
directions of linkage mapping in schistosomes.
