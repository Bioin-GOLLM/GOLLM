OBJECTIVE: Synovial fibroblasts in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
contribute substantially to the perpetuation of synovitis and invasion to 
cartilage and bone, and are potential therapeutic targets. Fibroblast activation 
protein (FAP) is highly expressed by RA synovial fibroblasts and the expression 
is relatively specific. We tested whether FAP can serve as a molecular target to 
modulate synovial fibroblasts for therapy in experimental arthritis.
METHODS: mRNA encoding consensus FAP (cFAP) was encapsulated in lipid 
nanoparticles (LNP) and was injected intramuscularly as vaccine prior to 
induction of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and collagen antibody induced 
arthritis (CAIA) in mice. Development of CIA and CAIA was assessed clinically 
and by histology.
RESULTS: cFAP mRNA-LNP vaccine provoked immune response to cFAP and mouse FAP 
(mFAP); prevented onset of CIA in 40% of mice and significantly reduced the 
severity of arthritis. In CAIA, cFAP mRNA-LNP did not prevent onset of arthritis 
but significantly reduced the severity of arthritis.
CONCLUSION: cFAP mRNA-LNP vaccine was able to provoke immune response to mFAP 
and suppress inflammatory arthritis.
