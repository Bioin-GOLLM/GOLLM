The retinal degeneration slow (rds/rds) mouse was used to test photoreceptor 
protection by systemic gene delivery of non-erythropoietic forms of 
erythropoietin (EPO). Two Epo mutants were generated and packaged into 
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) serotype 2/5, controls included 
rAAV2/5.Epo and rAAV2/5.enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Mice were 
injected in the quadriceps at postnatal day seven and analyses were performed at 
postnatal day 90. Hematocrit, serum EPO levels, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) 
thickness were quantified. Hematocrit and serum EPO levels in rAAV2/5.eGFP, 
rAAV2/5.Epo, and rAAV2/5.EpoR103E treated mice were: 46%, 8 mU/ml; 63%, 117 
mU/ml; and 52%, 332 mU/ml, respectively. The ONL from rds/rds mice treated with 
the Epo vectors were approximately twice as thick as the negative controls. This 
demonstrates that the photoreceptors can be protected without performing an 
intraocular injection and without increasing the hematocrit to unsafe levels. 
Intramuscular delivery of rAAV.EpoR103E is an attractive treatment for retinal 
degenerative diseases.
