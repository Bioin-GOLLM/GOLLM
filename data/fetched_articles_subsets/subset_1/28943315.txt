Many infections and stress signals can rapidly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome 
to elicit robust inflammatory responses. This activation requires a priming 
step, which is thought to be mainly for upregulating NLRP3 transcription. 
However, recent studies report that the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated 
independently of transcription, suggesting that the priming process has unknown 
essential regulatory steps. Here, we report that JNK1-mediated NLRP3 
phosphorylation at S194 is a critical priming event and is essential for NLRP3 
inflammasome activation. We show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is disrupted 
in NLRP3-S194A knockin mice. JNK1-mediated NLRP3 S194 phosphorylation is 
critical for NLRP3 deubiquitination and facilitates its self-association and the 
subsequent inflammasome assembly. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking S194 
phosphorylation prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cryopyrin-associated 
periodic syndromes (CAPS). Thus, our study reveals a key priming molecular event 
that is a prerequisite for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inhibiting NLRP3 
phosphorylation could be an effective treatment for NLRP3-related diseases.
