We report on the crystallite growth of nanometric NpO2 and UO2 powders. The AnO2 
nanoparticles (An = U and Np) were synthesized by hydrothermal decomposition of 
the corresponding actinide(iv) oxalates. NpO2 powder was isothermally annealed 
between 950 °C and 1150 °C and UO2 between 650 °C and 1000 °C. The crystallite 
growth was then followed by high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD). The 
activation energies for the growth of crystallites of UO2 and NpO2 were 
determined to be 264(26) kJ mol-1 and 442(32) kJ mol-1, respectively, with a 
growth exponent n = 4. The value of the exponent n and the low activation energy 
suggest that the crystalline growth is rate-controlled by the mobility of the 
pores, which migrate by atomic diffusion along the pore surfaces. We could thus 
estimate the cation self-diffusion coefficient along the surface in UO2, NpO2 
and PuO2. While data for surface diffusion coefficients for NpO2 and PuO2 are 
lacking in the literature, the comparison with literature data for UO2 supports 
further the hypothesis of a surface diffusion controlled growth mechanism.
