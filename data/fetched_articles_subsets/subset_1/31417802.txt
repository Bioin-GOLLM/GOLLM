Six new 1-aroyl-4-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazines have been prepared, using 
coupling reactions between benzoic acids and N-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazine. 
There are no significant hydrogen bonds in the structure of 
1-benzoyl-4-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazine, C18H20N2O2, (I). The mol-ecules of 
1-(2-fluoro-benzo-yl)-4-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazine, C18H19FN2O2, (II), are 
linked by two C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds to form chains of rings, which are linked 
into sheets by an aromatic π-π stacking inter-action. 
1-(2-Chloro-benzo-yl)-4-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazine, C18H19ClN2O2, (III), 
1-(2-bromo-benzo-yl)-4-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazine, C18H19BrN2O2, (IV), and 
1-(2-iodo-benzo-yl)-4-(4-meth-oxyphen-yl)piperazine, C18H19IN2O2, (V), are 
isomorphous, but in (III) the aroyl ring is disordered over two sets of atomic 
sites having occupancies of 0.942 (2) and 0.058 (2). In each of (III)-(V), a 
combination of two C-H⋯π(arene) hydrogen bonds links the mol-ecules into sheets. 
A single O-H⋯O hydrogen bond links the mol-ecules of 
1-(2-hy-droxy-benzo-yl)-4-(4-meth-oxy-phen-yl)piperazine, C18H20N2O3, (VI), into 
simple chains. Comparisons are made with the structures of some related 
compounds.
