Immunoglobulin E (IgE), a key mediator in allergic diseases, is spontaneously 
elevated in mice with disrupted commensal microbiota such as germ-free (GF) and 
antibiotics-treated mice. However, the underlying mechanisms for aberrant IgE 
elevation are still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that food antigens drive 
spontaneous IgE elevation in GF and antibiotics-treated mice by generating T 
helper 2 (TH2)-skewed T follicular helper (TFH) cells in gut-associated lymphoid 
tissues (GALTs). In these mice, depriving contact with food antigens results in 
defective IgE elevation as well as impaired generation of TFH cells and 
IgE-producing cells in GALT. Food antigen-driven TFH cells in GF mice are mostly 
generated in early life, especially during the weaning period. We also reveal 
that food antigen-driven TFH cells in GF mice are actively depleted by 
colonization with commensal microbiota. Thus, our findings provide a possible 
explanation for why the perturbation of commensal microbiota in early life 
increases the occurrence of allergic diseases.
