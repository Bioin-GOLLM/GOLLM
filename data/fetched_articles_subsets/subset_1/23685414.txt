This report deals with a female patient with schizophrenia who was found to have 
a mutation in the insulin receptor substrate-4 gene that is located on 
chromosome Xq22.3. Since this mutation is expected to change amino acid coding 
from histidine to tyrosine and cause an altered insulin receptor substrate-4 
protein, and the insulin receptor substrate-4 protein may be involved in 
neuronal growth and function in the brain, it is possible that it is this 
insulin receptor substrate-4 gene mutation that underlies this patient's 
schizophrenia development.
