PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Disaccharidase testing, as applied to the evaluation of 
gastrointestinal disturbances is available but it is not routinely considered in 
the diagnostic work-up. The purpose of this review was to determine if 
disaccharidase testing is clinically useful and to consider how the results 
could alter patient management.
RECENT FINDINGS: Indicate that carbohydrate maldigestion could contribute 
functional bowel disorders and negatively impact the fecal microbiome. 
Diagnostic techniques include enzyme activity assays performed on random 
endoscopically obtained small intestinal biopsies, immunohistochemistry, stable 
isotope tracer and nonenriched substrate load breath testing, and genetic 
testing for mutations. More than 40 sucrase--isomaltase gene variants coding for 
defective or reduced enzymatic activity have been reported and deficiency 
conditions are more common than previously thought.
SUMMARY: The rationale for disaccharidase activity testing relates to a need to 
fully assess unexplained recurrent abdominal discomfort and associated symptoms. 
All disaccharidases share the same basic mechanism of mucosal expression and 
deficiency has far reaching consequences. Testing for disaccharidase expression 
appears to have an important role in symptom evaluation, but there are accuracy 
and logistical issues that should be considered. It is likely that specific 
recommendations for patient management, dietary modification, and enzyme 
supplementation would come from better testing methods.
