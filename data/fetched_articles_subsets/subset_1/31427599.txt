Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now clinically considered as a chronic 
inflammation-based neurodegenerative disease. The CDnir7 probe was previously 
developed as an optical imaging probe to target macrophages in order to image 
mouse inflammation using in vivo optical imaging modalities such as In Vivo 
imaging system (IVIS) and fluorescent molecular tomography (FMT). Here, we 
demonstrate the application of CDnir7 in AD mouse brain imaging via 
multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Longitudinal MSOT imaging of 
CDnir7 showed higher CDnir7 localization in AD mouse cerebral cortex compared to 
that of normal mice. MSOT signals of CDnir7 localization in mouse brain were 
verified by ex vivo near-infrared (NIR) imaging and immunohistochemistry. 
Histological evaluation showed strong CDnir7 staining in AD cerebral cortex, 
hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamus area. Based on the supporting evidence, 
CDnir7 has great potential as a molecular imaging probe for AD brain imaging.
