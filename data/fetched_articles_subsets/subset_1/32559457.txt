Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from diverse humans offer the potential 
to study human functional variation in controlled culture environments. A 
portion of this variation originates from an ancient admixture between modern 
humans and Neandertals, which introduced alleles that left a phenotypic legacy 
on individual humans today. Here, we show that a large iPSC repository harbors 
extensive Neandertal DNA, including alleles that contribute to human phenotypes 
and diseases, encode hundreds of amino acid changes, and alter gene expression 
in specific tissues. We provide a database of the inferred introgressed 
Neandertal alleles for each individual iPSC line, together with the annotation 
of the predicted functional variants. We also show that transcriptomic data from 
organoids generated from iPSCs can be used to track Neandertal-derived RNA over 
developmental processes. Human iPSC resources provide an opportunity to 
experimentally explore Neandertal DNA function and its contribution to 
present-day phenotypes, and potentially study Neandertal traits.
