PURPOSE: Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a transmembrane receptor that mediates 
immune responses to exogenous and endogenous ligands, and interacts with 
heat-shock proteins, which are reportedly involved in normal tension glaucoma 
(NTG). We investigated whether TLR2 polymorphisms are associated with NTG.
METHODS: 200 Japanese patients with NTG and 128 healthy Japanese controls were 
recruited. We genotyped five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR2 
gene and assessed the allele and haplotype diversities between cases and 
controls for all SNPs.
RESULTS: No significant differences in the frequency of TLR2 alleles and 
haplotypes in the NTG cases were detected, compared with the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed no evidence for an association between TLR2 
polymorphisms and NTG. TLR2 polymorphisms may not play an important role in NTG 
pathogenesis in the Japanese population.
