Previous studies have indicated that the cognitive impairment or deficit is 
associated with GABAergic signaling in central nervous system. Inspired by the 
finding that receptor GABRR2 modulates concentration of GABA and phasic 
inhibitory GABAergic transmission in brain. This study investigated to what 
extent a genetic variant (c.1423C>T, rs282129) of GABRR2 gene modulates 
individuals' general cognitive ability in 987 Chinese Han people. Results showed 
a significant influence of GABRR2 gene polymorphism on individuals' Raven's 
Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) performance (F = 3.58, P = .028 by ANOVA 
and χ 2 = 9.35, P = .009 by K-W test, respectively), even if non-genetic factors 
were partialed out (gender, major, types of birthplace, and socioeconomic index) 
(B = -.67, SE = .26, t = 2.63, P = .009). The finding provided a strong 
evidence, to our knowledge, for the view that genetic variant of GABRR2 gene may 
contribute to the difference of individuals' general cognitive ability, 
independently.
