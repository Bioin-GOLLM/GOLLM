The absence of the Duffy protein at the surface of erythrocytes was considered 
for decades to confer full protection against Plasmodium vivax as this blood 
group is the receptor for the key parasite ligand P. vivax Duffy binding protein 
(PvDBP). However, it is now clear that the parasite is able to break through 
this protection and induce clinical malaria in Duffy-negative people, although 
the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Here, we briefly review the 
evidence of Duffy-negative infections by P. vivax and summarize the current 
hypothesis at the basis of this invasion process. We discuss those in the 
perspective of malaria-elimination challenges, notably in African countries.
