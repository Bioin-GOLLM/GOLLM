During blood vessel development, endothelial cells become specified toward 
arterial or venous fates to generate a circulatory network that provides 
nutrients and oxygen to, and removes metabolic waste from, all tissues. 
Arterial-venous specification occurs in conjunction with suppression of 
endothelial cell cycle progression; however, the mechanistic role of cell cycle 
state is unknown. Herein, using Cdh5-CreERT2;R26FUCCI2aR reporter mice, we find 
that venous endothelial cells are enriched for the FUCCI-Negative state (early 
G1) and BMP signaling, while arterial endothelial cells are enriched for the 
FUCCI-Red state (late G1) and TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, early G1 state is 
essential for BMP4-induced venous gene expression, whereas late G1 state is 
essential for TGF-β1-induced arterial gene expression. Pharmacologically induced 
cell cycle arrest prevents arterial-venous specification defects in mice with 
endothelial hyperproliferation. Collectively, our results show that distinct 
endothelial cell cycle states provide distinct windows of opportunity for the 
molecular induction of arterial vs. venous fate.
