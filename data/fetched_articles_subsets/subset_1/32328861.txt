Some hereditary ovarian cancer cases can be associated with a mutation of a gene 
involved in the DNA double-strand break repair system other than BRCA, such as 
BRIP1. This mutation is an emerging indication for prophylactic risk-reducing 
salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO): however, anomalous tubal pathologic lesions have 
not yet been reported during RRSO performed for this specific indication 
(BRIP1), as largely reported for BRCA mutation carriers. An asymptomatic 
64-year-old woman with a family history of ovarian and breast cancer agreed to 
undergo RRSO for a pathogenic variant of the BRIP1 gene (heterozygous 
NM_032043.2: c.124delT, p. Cys42Valfs) with normal BRCA genes. Histological 
examination showed the presence of high-grade serous carcinoma of the fimbria of 
the right tube of a maximum diameter of 0.4 cm (final FIGO stage IIB). The 
pathogenic mechanism that leads to the development of high-grade serous 
ovarian/fallopian tube cancer in patients with mutations of BRIP1 should be the 
same as for patients with mutations of BRCA1 and 2. Our case confirms to 
consider BRIP1 mutation to be sufficient to justify RRSO at 45-50 years old.
