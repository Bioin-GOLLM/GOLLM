Initiation of RNA synthesis from DNA templates by RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a 
multi-step process, in which initial recognition of promoter DNA by RNAP 
triggers a series of conformational changes in both RNAP and promoter DNA. The 
bacterial RNAP functions as a molecular isomerization machine, using binding 
free energy to remodel the initial recognition complex, placing downstream 
duplex DNA in the active site cleft and then separating the nontemplate and 
template strands in the region surrounding the start site of RNA synthesis. In 
this initial unstable "open" complex the template strand appears correctly 
positioned in the active site. Subsequently, the nontemplate strand is 
repositioned and a clamp is assembled on duplex DNA downstream of the open 
region to form the highly stable open complex, RP(o). The transcription 
initiation factor, σ(70), plays critical roles in promoter recognition and RP(o) 
formation as well as in early steps of RNA synthesis.
