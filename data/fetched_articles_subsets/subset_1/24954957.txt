The electron paramagnetic resonance technique of double electron-electron 
resonance (DEER) was used to measure nanometre-scale distances between nitroxide 
spin labels attached to the complement regulatory protein CD55 (also known as 
decay accelerating factor) and the von Willebrand factor A (vWF-A) domain of 
factor B. Following a thorough assessment of the quality of the data, distances 
obtained from good-quality measurements are compared to predicted distances from 
a previously hypothesised model for the complex and are found to be 
incompatible. The success of using these distances as restraints in multi-body 
docking routines is presented critically.
