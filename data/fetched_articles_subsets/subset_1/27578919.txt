Aims. Cancer cells use the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) pathway to 
suppress the host's immune response in order to facilitate survival, growth, 
invasion, and metastasis of malignant cells. Higher IDO1 expression was shown to 
be involved in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and to be correlated with 
impaired clinical outcome. However, the potential correlation between the 
expression of IDO1 in a CRC population with a low mutation rate of the APC gene 
remains unknown. Material and Methods. Tissues and blood samples were collected 
from 192 CRC patients. The expressions of IDO1, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 
(TDO2), and beta-catenin proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. 
Microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined by PCR amplification of 
microsatellite loci. Results. The results showed that high IDO1 or TDO2 protein 
expression was associated with characteristics of more aggressive phenotypes of 
CRC. For the first time, they also revealed a positive correlation between the 
abnormal expression of beta-catenin and IDO1 or TDO2 proteins in a CRC 
population with a low mutation rate of APC. Conclusion. We concluded that an 
IDO1-regulated molecular pathway led to abnormal expression of beta-catenin in 
the nucleus/cytoplasm of CRC patients with low mutation rate of APC, making IDO1 
an interesting target for immunotherapy in CRC.
