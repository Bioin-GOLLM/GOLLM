p-Coumaric acid (p-CA) is a key precursor for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. 
Tyrosine ammonia lyases (TALs) specifically catalyze the synthesis of p-CA from 
l-tyrosine, which is a convenient enzymatic pathway. To explore novel and highly 
active TALs, a phylogenetic tree-building approach was conducted including 875 
putative TALs and 46 putative phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyases (PTALs). 
Among them, 5 TALs and 3 PTALs were successfully characterized and found to 
exhibit the proposed enzymatic activity. The TAL from Chryseobacterium luteum 
sp. nov (TALclu ) has the highest affinity (Km =0.019 mm) and conversion 
efficiency (kcat /Km= 1631 s-1  ⋅ mm-1 ) towards l-tyrosine. The reaction 
conditions for two purified enzymes and their E. coli recombinant cells were 
optimized and p-CA yields of 2.03 g/L after 8 hours by TALclu and 2.35 g/L after 
24 h by TAL from Rivularia sp. PCC 7116 (TALrpc ) in whole cells were achieved. 
These TALs are thus candidates for the construction of whole-cell systems to 
produce the flavonoid precursor p-CA.
