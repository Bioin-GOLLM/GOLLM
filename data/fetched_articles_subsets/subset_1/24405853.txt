BACKGROUND: The Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase-2 (ROCK2) is an important 
signaling transducer in the transmission of extracellular signals effecting 
organization of the actin cytoskeleton. ROCK2 has been implicated in numerous 
pathologies and the current focus is on understanding the molecular events that 
couple ROCK2 activity to biological function. To aid in the search for new ROCK2 
substrates, we have developed an analog-sensitive (AS) ROCK2 protein that allows 
the use of selective ATP analogs that are not efficiently utilized by other 
protein kinases.
RESULTS: The analog sensitive protein, M160A ROCK2, was highly active and could 
phosphorylate proteins from a cellular homogenate with γ32P-N6 (benzyl)ATP. We 
show the utility of this approach by identifying a putative ROCK2 substrate, 
elongation initiation factor-1-α1. We further show that the major site of ROCK2 
phosphorylation of EIF1α1 is Thr432.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that AS-ROCK2 could be useful in a systematic 
proteomic approach for identifying novel ROCK2 substrates.
