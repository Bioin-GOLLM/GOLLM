Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Common HFE 
mutations (C282Y and H63D) are related to the majority of hereditary 
hemochromatosis cases in populations of Northern European ancestry (HFE1). 
Juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) is a more severe iron overload disorder, usually 
presenting at the second decade of life. The gene responsible for JH lies on a 
genetic locus at chromosome 1q. We have performed a genetic linkage study in 
three families of Northern Greek origin with typical clinical features of JH. In 
two families results were in accordance with linkage to chromosome 1q. In one 
family linkage of the disease to the genetic loci at 1q21, 7q22, and 6p22 was 
excluded. We suggest that more than one gene may underlie the JH phenotype. This 
genetic type of hemochromatosis may be designated 1q unlinked juvenile 
hemochromatosis. Family studies are necessary to establish the genetic diagnosis 
of JH.
