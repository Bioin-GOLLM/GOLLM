A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed to control the unprecedented 
COVID-19 pandemic. Four adenovirus-vectored vaccines expressing spike (S) 
protein have been approved for use. Here, we generated several recombinant 
chimpanzee adenovirus (AdC7) vaccines expressing S, receptor-binding domain 
(RBD), or tandem-repeat dimeric RBD (RBD-tr2). We found vaccination via either 
intramuscular or intranasal route was highly immunogenic in mice to elicit both 
humoral and cellular immune responses. AdC7-RBD-tr2 showed higher antibody 
responses compared to either AdC7-S or AdC7-RBD. Intranasal administration of 
AdC7-RBD-tr2 additionally induced mucosal immunity with neutralizing activity in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Either single-dose or two-dose mucosal 
administration of AdC7-RBD-tr2 protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, with 
undetectable subgenomic RNA in lung and relieved lung injury. 
AdC7-RBD-tr2-elicted sera preserved the neutralizing activity against the 
circulating variants, especially the Delta variant. These results support 
AdC7-RBD-tr2 as a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
