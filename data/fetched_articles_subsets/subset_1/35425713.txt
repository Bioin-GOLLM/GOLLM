Multiple oncogenic molecular alterations have been discovered that serve as 
potential drug targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While the 
pathogenic and pharmacological features of common targets in NSCLC have been 
widely investigated, those of uncommon targets are still needed to be clarified. 
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, ERBB2)-altered tumors represent 
a highly heterogeneous group of diseases, which consists of three distinct 
situations including mutation, amplification and overexpression. Compared with 
breast and gastric cancer, previous studies have shown modest and variable 
results of anti-HER2 treatments in lung cancers with HER2 aberrations, thus 
effective therapies in these patients represent an unmet medical need. By far, 
encouraging efforts towards novel treatment strategies have been made to improve 
the clinical outcomes of these patients. In this review, we describe the 
biological and clinicopathological characteristics of HER2 alterations and 
systematically sum up recent studies on emerging therapies for this subset of 
patients.
