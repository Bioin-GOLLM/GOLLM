Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) maintain regenerative capacity of the intestinal 
epithelium. Their function and activity are regulated by transcriptional 
changes, yet how such changes are coordinated at the genomic level remains 
unclear. The Cohesin complex regulates transcription globally by generating 
topologically-associated DNA domains (TADs) that link promotor regions with 
distant enhancers. We show here that the Cohesin complex prevents premature 
differentiation of Drosophila ISCs into enterocytes (ECs). Depletion of the 
Cohesin subunit Rad21 and the loading factor Nipped-B triggers an ISC to EC 
differentiation program that is independent of Notch signaling, but can be 
rescued by over-expression of the ISC-specific escargot (esg) transcription 
factor. Using damID and transcriptomic analysis, we find that Cohesin regulates 
Esg binding to promoters of differentiation genes, including a group of Notch 
target genes involved in ISC differentiation. We propose that Cohesin ensures 
efficient Esg-dependent gene repression to maintain stemness and intestinal 
homeostasis.
