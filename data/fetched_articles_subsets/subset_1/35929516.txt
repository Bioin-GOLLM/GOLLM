Bone tissue undergoes continuous remodeling via osteoclast-mediated bone 
resorption and osteoblast-mediated bone formation. An imbalance in this process 
with enhanced osteoclastic activity can lead to excessive bone resorption, 
resulting in bone thinning. Once activated, osteoclasts bind to the bone surface 
and acidify the local niche. This acidic environment could serve as a potential 
trigger for the delivery of therapeutic agents into the osteoporotic bone 
tissue. To this end, we developed a pH-responsive nanocarrier-based drug 
delivery system that binds to the bone tissue and delivers an osteoanabolic 
molecule, adenosine. Adenosine is incorporated into a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based 
nanocarrier through a pH-sensitive ketal group. The HA-nanocarrier is further 
functionalized with alendronate moieties to improve binding to the bone tissues. 
Systemic administration of the nanocarrier containing adenosine attenuated bone 
loss in ovariectomized mice and showed comparable bone qualities to that of 
healthy mice. Delivery of osteoanabolic small molecules that can contribute to 
bone formation and inhibit excessive osteoclast activity by leveraging the 
tissue-specific milieu could serve as viable therapeutics for osteoporosis.
