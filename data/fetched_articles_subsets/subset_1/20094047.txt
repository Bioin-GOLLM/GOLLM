Kinase inhibitors are the largest class of new cancer drugs. However, it is 
already apparent that most tumours can escape from the inhibition of any single 
kinase. If it is necessary to inhibit multiple kinases, how do we choose which 
ones? In this Opinion article, we discuss some of the strategies that are 
currently being used to identify new therapeutic combinations of kinase targets.
