OBJECTIVE: Antibody-drugs conjugates (ADCs) are novel drugs with highly targeted 
and tumor-killing abilities and developing rapidly. This study aimed to evaluate 
drug discovery and clinical trials of and explore the hotspots and frontiers 
from 2012 to 2022 using bibliometric methods.
METHODS: Publications on ADCs were retrieved between 2012 and 2022 from Web of 
Science (WoS) and analyzed with CiteSpace 6.1.R2 software for the time, region, 
journals, institutions, etc. Clinical trials were downloaded from clinical 
trial.org and visualized with Excel software.
RESULTS: A total of 696 publications were obtained and 187 drug trials were 
retrieved. Since 2012, research on ADCs has increased year by year. Since 2020, 
ADC-related research has increased dramatically, with the number of relevant 
annual publications exceeding 100 for the first time. The United States is the 
most authoritative and superior country and region in the field of ADCs. The 
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is the most authoritative 
institution in this field. Research on ADCs includes two clinical trials and one 
review, which are the most influential references. Clinical trials of ADCs are 
currently focused on phase I and phase II. Comprehensive statistics and analysis 
of the published literature and clinical trials in the field of ADCs, have shown 
that the most studied drug is brentuximab vedotin (BV), the most popular target 
is human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and breast cancer may become 
the main trend and hotspot for ADCs indications in recent years.
CONCLUSION: Antibody-drug conjugates have become the focus of targeted therapies 
in the field of oncology. The innovation of technology and combination 
application strategy will become the main trend and hotspots in the future.
