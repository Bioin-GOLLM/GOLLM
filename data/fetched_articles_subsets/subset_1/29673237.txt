Panax notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen, as traditional Chinese medicine, has a long 
history of high clinical value, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, 
inhibition of platelet aggregation, regulation of blood glucose and blood 
pressure, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, and neuronal protection, and its 
main ingredients are Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS). Currently, Panax 
notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen may improve mental function, have anti-insomnia 
and anti-depression effects, alleviate anxiety, and decrease neural network 
excitation. However, the underlying effects and the mechanisms of Panax 
notoginseng (Burk) F. H. Chen and its containing chemical constituents (PNS) on 
these depression-related or anxiety-related diseases has not been completely 
established. This review summarized the antidepressant or anxiolytic effects and 
mechanisms of PNS and analyzed network targets of antidepressant or anxiolytic 
actions with network pharmacology tools to provide directions and references for 
further pharmacological studies and new ideas for clinical treatment of nervous 
system diseases and drug studies and development. The review showed PNS and its 
components may exert these effects through regulating neurotransmitter mechanism 
(5-HT, DA, NE), modulation of the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) 
neurotransmission, glutamatergic system, hypo-thalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
axis, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and its intracellular signaling 
pathways in the central nervous system; and produce neuronal protection by 
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, or inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, or 
platelet aggregation and its intracellular signaling pathways. Network target 
analysis indicated PNS and its components also may have anti-inflammatory and 
anti-apoptotic effects, which leads to the preservation of brain nerves, and 
regulate the activity and secretion of nerve cells, exerting anti-depression and 
anxiolytic effects, which may provide new directions for further in-depth 
researches of related mechanisms.
