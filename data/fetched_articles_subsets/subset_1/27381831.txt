Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA genes have been associated 
with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, survival and response to treatment. 
Conflicting results are available on the association between rs4919510, a SNP in 
mature miR-608 and clinical outcome in CRC. Here, we analyzed the association 
between rs4919510 and benefit from perioperative treatment in a randomised phase 
II trial of neoadjuvant Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by 
chemo-radiotherapy, surgery and adjuvant CAPOX ± Cetuximab in high-risk locally 
advanced rectal cancer (LARC). A total of 155/164 (94.5%) patients were 
assessable. 95 (61.3%) were homozygous for CC, 55 (35.5%) heterozygous (CG) and 
5 (3.2%) homozygous for GG. Median follow-up was 64.9 months. In the CAPOX arm 
the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 
54.6% and 60.7% for CC and 82.0% and 82.1% for CG/GG, respectively (HR PFS 0.13, 
95% CI: 0.12-0.83, P = 0.02; HR OS 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14-1.01, P = 0.05). In the 
CAPOX-C arm PFS and OS were 73.2 and 82.2%, respectively for CC carriers and 
64.6 and 73.1% for CG/GG carriers (HR PFS 1.38, 95% CI: 0.61-3.13, P = 0.44; HR 
OS 1.34, 95% CI: 0.52-3.48, P = 0.55). An interaction was found between study 
treatment and rs4919510 genotype for both PFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P = 0.07). This 
is the first study investigating rs4919510 in LARC. The CC genotype appeared to 
be associated with worse prognosis compared to the CG/GG genotype in patients 
treated with chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy alone. Addition of Cetuximab to 
chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy in CC carriers appeared to improve clinical 
outcome.
