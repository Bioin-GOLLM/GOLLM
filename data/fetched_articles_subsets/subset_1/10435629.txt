To determine the frequency of Wnt/Wingless beta catenin pathway alteration in 
human hepatocellular carcinoma, a beta catenin and APC gene mutation screening 
was performed in a series of 119 tumors. An activating beta catenin mutation in 
exon 3 was found in 18% of the cases. Among tumors lacking beta catenin 
mutation, no APC mutation has been evidenced in a subset of 30 cases tested. The 
correlation between beta catenin mutation status and chromosome segment 
deletions was studied on a set of 48 hyperploid tumors. Chromosome 1p, 4q and 
16p deletions were significantly associated with the absence of beta catenin 
mutation (P<0.05). Furthermore the Fractional Allelic Loss was significantly 
smaller in the beta catenin mutated tumors than in the non-mutated tumors (0.12 
versus 022). Taken together, these results suggest, the existence of two 
carcinogenesis mechanisms. The first mechanism implies a beta catenin activating 
mutation associated with a low rate of loss of heterozygosity. The second 
mechanism, operating in a context of chromosomal instability, would involve 
tumor suppressor genes.
