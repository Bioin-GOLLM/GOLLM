Tatton-Brown Rahman syndrome (TBRS) is an overgrowth-intellectual disability 
syndrome caused by heterozygous variants in DNMT3A. Seventy-eight individuals 
have been reported with a consistent phenotype of somatic overgrowth, mild to 
moderate intellectual disability, and similar dysmorphisms. We present six 
individuals with TBRS, including the youngest individual thus far reported, 
first individual to be diagnosed with tumor testing and two individuals with 
variants at the Arg882 domain, bringing the total number of reported cases to 
82. Patients reported herein have additional clinical features not previously 
reported in TBRS. One patient had congenital diaphragmatic hernia. One patient 
carrying the recurrent p.Arg882His DNMT3A variant, who was previously reported 
as having a phenotype due to a truncating variant in the CLTC gene, developed a 
ganglioneuroblastoma at 18 months and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma at 6 years 
of age. Four patients manifested symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction, 
including central sleep apnea, postural orthostatic hypotension, and episodic 
vasomotor instability in the extremities. We discuss the molecular and clinical 
findings in our patients with TBRS in context of existing literature.
