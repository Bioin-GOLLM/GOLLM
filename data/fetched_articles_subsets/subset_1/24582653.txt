BACKGROUND: Mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 accounted for the most cases of autosomal 
dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The presence of the large 
transcript, numerous exons and complex reiterated regions within the gene has 
significantly complicated the analysis of PKD1 with routine PCR-based 
approaches.
METHODS: We developed a strategy to analyze both the PKD1/PKD2 genes 
simultaneously using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). All coding exons 
plus the flanking sequences of PKD1 and PKD2 genes from probands were captured, 
individually barcoded and followed by HiSeq2000 sequencing. The candidate 
variants were validated by using classic Sanger sequencing. PKD1-specific 
primers were designed to amplify the replicated areas of PKD1 gene.
RESULTS: Five novel variations and one known mutation in PKD1 gene were detected 
in five familial and one sporadic Chinese ADPKD patients. Through pedigree and 
bioinformatic analysis, five of them were identified as pathogenic mutations 
(p.G1319R, p.Y3781*, p.W4122*, p.Val700Glyfs*14, and p.Leu3656Trpfs*28) and one 
was as polymorphism (p.T2420I).
CONCLUSIONS: Our result showed that targeted capture and NGS technology were 
effective for the gene testing of ADPKD disorder. Mutation study of PKD1 and 
PKD2 genes in Chinese patients may contribute to better understanding of the 
genetic diversity between different ethnic groups and enrich the mutation 
database in Asian population.
