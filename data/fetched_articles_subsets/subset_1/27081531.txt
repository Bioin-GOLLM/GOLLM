The mediator complex subunit 12 gene (MED12) is responsible for an X-linked 
recessive intellectual disability syndrome that is characterized by dysmorphic 
features such as a long, narrow face and blepharophimosis, which is now 
recognized as an MED12-related syndrome. We identified a novel non-synonymous 
single-nucleotide variant, p.Ile1023Val, in a male patient with non-specific 
X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). Our results, together with the 
existence of similar reports, suggest a relationship between MED12 variants and 
XLID.
