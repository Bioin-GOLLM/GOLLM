Tuberculosis (TB) is an important health issue in the world. Although the 
relation of SLC11A1 polymorphisms with TB risk has been extensively studied, it 
has not been reported in the northwest Chinese Han population. Therefore, this 
study aimed to investigate the relationships between five polymorphisms in or 
near the SLC11A1 gene and susceptibility to TB. The Agena MassARRAY platform was 
conducted for genotyping from 510 TB patients and 508 healthy controls. Odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed through logistic 
regression adjustment age and gender to assess the relationships between 
polymorphisms and TB risk. Our results identified that rs7608307 was related to 
increased TB risk in males (CT vs. CC: OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.12-2.56, p = 0.013; 
CT-TT vs. CC: OR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.08-2.41, p = 0.020) and age ≤41 group (CT vs. 
CC: OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.04-2.65, p = 0.035), respectively. The SNP rs13062 was 
associated with the TB risk both in males (p = 0.012) and age >41 group (p = 
0.021). In addition, we observed that the CC genotype of rs4674301 was 
correlated with increased TB risk in females (p = 0.043). Our results 
demonstrated the relationships between polymorphisms (rs7608307, rs4674301, and 
rs13062) in or near the SLC11A1 gene and age- and sex-specific TB risk in the 
northwest Chinese Han population.
