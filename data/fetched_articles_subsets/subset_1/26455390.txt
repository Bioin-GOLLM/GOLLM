Phase-separated states of proteins underlie ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules and 
nuclear RNA-binding protein assemblies that may nucleate protein inclusions 
associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We report that the N-terminal 
low-complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS LC) is 
structurally disordered and forms a liquid-like phase-separated state resembling 
RNP granules. This state directly binds the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase 
II. Phase-separated FUS lacks static structures as probed by fluorescence 
microscopy, indicating they are distinct from both protein inclusions and 
hydrogels. We use solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to directly 
probe the dynamic architecture within FUS liquid phase-separated assemblies. 
Importantly, we find that FUS LC retains disordered secondary structure even in 
the liquid phase-separated state. Therefore, we propose that disordered protein 
granules, even those made of aggregation-prone prion-like domains, are dynamic 
and disordered molecular assemblies with transiently formed protein-protein 
contacts.
