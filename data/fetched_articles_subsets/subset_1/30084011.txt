The bone marrow is a preferential site for both reactive and neoplastic 
histiocytic proliferations. The differential diagnosis ranges from reactive 
histiocyte hyperplasia in systemic infections, vaccinations, storage diseases, 
post myeloablative therapy, due to increased cell turnover, and in 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, through extranodal Rosai-Dorfman disease to 
neoplasms derived from histiocytes, including histiocytic sarcomas (HS), 
Langerhans cell histiocytoses (LCH), Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), and 
disseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG). One of the most important recent 
developments in understanding the biology of histiocytic neoplasms and in 
contributing to diagnosis was the detection of recurrent mutations of genes of 
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, in particular the BRAFV600E mutation, in 
LCH and ECD. Here, we summarize clinical and pathological findings of 17 
histiocytic neoplasms that were presented during the bone marrow symposium and 
workshop of the 18th European Association for Haematopathology (EAHP) meeting 
held in Basel, Switzerland, in 2016. A substantial proportion of these 
histiocytic neoplasms was combined with clonally related lymphoid (n = 2) or 
myeloid diseases (n = 5, all ECD). Based on the latter observation, we suggest 
excluding co-existent myeloid neoplasms at initial staging of elderly ECD 
patients. The recurrent nature of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway mutations in 
histiocytic neoplasms was confirmed in 6 of the 17 workshop cases, illustrating 
their diagnostic significance and suggesting apotential target for tailored 
treatments.
