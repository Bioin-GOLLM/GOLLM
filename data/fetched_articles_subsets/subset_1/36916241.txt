INTRODUCTION: To report a family with severe ocular disorder caused by double 
gene variants in causative genes of autosomal dominant cataracts, GJA8 and 
CRYGC.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 5-month-old boy with poor vision and enophthalmos was 
referred to our hospital. Further ocular examination showed horizontal 
nystagmus, iris abnormalities with pinpoint pupils, and extreme microphthalmia 
with axial right and left eye lengths of 13.48 mm and 13.75 mm, respectively. 
Digenic heterozygous variants (c.269T > G, p.Leu90Arg in CRYGC and c.151G > A, 
p.Asp51Asn in GJA8) have been detected based on the whole exome sequencing. His 
mother, who carried variant in CRYGC (c.269T > G, p.Leu90Arg), had nuclear 
cataract, microcornea and nystagmus, while his father, who carried variant in 
GJA8 (c.151G > A, p.Asp51Asn), showed bilateral membranous cataract, 
microphthalmia, sclerocornea, glaucoma, and nystagmus.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with 
variants in two cataract-related genes. Importantly, patient with double 
heterozygous variants in two dominantly inherited genes may suffer more serious 
phenotypes than those with heterozygous variant in a single dominantly inherited 
gene. Whole exome or genome sequencing is necessary for a genetic diagnosis in 
case of multiple gene variants.
