Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) harbor marked intratumoral heterogeneity 
in terms of morphology, steroidogenesis, and genetics. However, an association 
of biological significance of morphologically identified tumor cell subtypes and 
genotypes is virtually unknown. KCNJ5 mutation is most frequently detected and 
generally considered a curable phenotype by adrenalectomy. Therefore, to explore 
the biological significance of KCNJ5 mutation in APA based on intracellular 
hormonal activities, 35 consecutively selected APAs (n=18; KCNJ5 mutated, n=17; 
wild type) were quantitatively examined in the whole tumor areas by newly 
developed digital image analysis incorporating their histological and 
ultrastructural features (14 cells from 2 KCNJ5-mutated APAs and 15 cells from 1 
wild type) and CYP11B2 immunoreactivity. Results demonstrated that KCNJ5-mutated 
APAs had significantly lower nuclear/cytoplasm ratio and more abundant clear 
cells than wild type. CYP11B2 immunoreactivity was not significantly different 
between these genotypes, but a significant correlation was detected between the 
proportion of clear cells and CYP11B2 immunoreactivity in all of the APAs 
examined. CYP11B2 was predominantly immunolocalized in clear cells in 
KCNJ5-mutated APAs. Quantitative ultrastructural analysis revealed that 
KCNJ5-mutated APAs had significantly more abundant and smaller-sized 
mitochondria with well-developed cristae than wild type, whereas wild type had 
more abundant lipid droplets per unit area despite the small number of the cases 
examined. Our results did provide the novel insights into the morphological 
features of APA based on their biological significance. KCNJ5-mutated APAs were 
characterized by predominance of enlarged lipid-rich clear cells possibly 
resulting in increased neoplastic aldosterone biosynthesis.
