Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a key component of the extracellular matrix. HA and its 
metabolism are suggested to be altered in the lungs of patients with chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present study explored systemic HA, 
and its metabolic regulators, in patients with clinically stable COPD and 
smoking and non-smoking controls. Furthermore, associations of HA with acute 
exacerbations (AECOPD), airway-related hospitalizations, systemic inflammation 
and cardiovascular risk were studied. In total, 192 patients with moderate to 
very severe COPD [aged 62.3 y (± SD 7.0)], 84 smoking controls [aged 61.8 y 
(± 5.7)], and 107 non-smoking controls [aged 60.1 y (± 7.0)] were included. 
Plasma HA was reduced in patients with COPD compared to non-smoking controls 
(p = 0.033), but was comparable after adjusting for age and sex. Expression of 
HAS-3 did not differ between groups, but was substantially less detectable in 
more patients with COPD than (non)smoking controls (p < 0.001). Expression of 
HYAL-2 was enhanced in patients with COPD versus smoking (p = 0.019) and 
non-smoking (p < 0.001) controls, also in the age- and sex- adjusted model 
(p < 0.001). Plasma HA was not associated with AECOPD, airway-related 
hospitalizations in the previous year, or systemic inflammation in COPD. 
Arterial pulse wave velocity explained some of the variance (< 10%) in plasma HA 
(p = 0.006). Overall, these results indicate that expression of HYAL-2, but not 
plasma HA nor HAS-3, is enhanced in patients with COPD compared to (non)smoking 
controls. Furthermore, HA was not associated with clinical outcomes, yet, 
cardiovascular risk might play a role in its systemic regulation in stable COPD.
