Neuronal pathology of the brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized 
by numerous depositions of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta). Abeta binding to the 
75-kDa neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) causes neuronal cell death. Here we report 
that Abeta causes cell death in neuronal hybrid cells transfected with p75NTR, 
but not in nontransfected cells, and that p75NTR(L401K) cannot mediate Abeta 
neurotoxicity. We analyzed the cytotoxic pathway by transfecting pertussis toxin 
(PTX)-resistant G protein alpha subunits in the presence of PTX and identified 
that Galpha(o), but not Galpha(i), proteins are involved in p75NTR-mediated 
Abeta neurotoxicity. Further investigation suggested that Abeta neurotoxicity 
via p75NTR involved JNK, NADPH oxidase, and caspases-9/3 and was inhibited by 
activity-dependent neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, basic 
fibroblast growth factor, and Humanin, as observed in primary neuron cultures. 
Understanding the Abeta neurotoxic mechanism would contribute significantly to 
the development of anti-AD therapies.
