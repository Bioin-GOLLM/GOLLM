PURPOSE: Three VEGF SNPs (-2578) C/A, (+405) G/C and (+936) C/T were 
investigated in Tunisian exudative AMD patients in order to determine their 
association with the disease susceptibility and their influence to intravitreal 
bevacizumab therapy response.
METHODS: 145 AMD patients and 207 age-matched controls were included. 68 
patients were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. SNPs genotyping were 
performed using direct sequencing. The serum VEGF was assayed by ELISA (R&D).
RESULTS: The (+405) CC and (+936) TT genotypes were higher in AMD patients than 
in controls (p = 5 × 10(-6) and p = 0.021, respectively). The mean plasma levels 
of VEGF were statistically higher in AMD patients (84.22 pg/ml) than in controls 
(15 pg/ml). Three months after bevacizumab treatment, 52 patients (85.6%) were 
classified as good responders (GR) and 16 (14.4%) as poor responders (PR). The 
mean plasmatic-VEGF levels in GR patients was higher (86.61 ± 80.30 pg/ml) than 
in PR patients (47.12 ± 45.74 pg/ml) (p = 0.086). The patients with genotype 
homozygous TT (+936) would be PR compared to those carrying CT and CC genotypes. 
Whereas, those with AA (-2578) genotype would be GR compared with others 
genotypes (p = 0.014; p = 0.042 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that VEGF genetic variants may contribute to the 
susceptibility to neovascular AMD in Tunisian patients.
