Parkinson's disease (PD) is a well-known age-related neurodegenerative disease. 
Considering the vital importance of disease modeling based on reprogramming 
technology, we adopted direct reprogramming to human-induced neuronal progenitor 
cells (hiNPCs) for in vitro assessment of potential therapeutics. In this study, 
we investigated the neuroprotective effects of cryptotanshinone (CTN), which has 
been reported to have antioxidant properties, through PD patient-derived hiNPCs 
(PD-iNPCs) model with induced oxidative stress and cell death by the proteasome 
inhibitor MG132. A cytotoxicity assay showed that CTN possesses anti-apoptotic 
properties in PD-hiNPCs. CTN treatment significantly reduced cellular apoptosis 
through mitochondrial restoration, such as the reduction in mitochondrial 
reactive oxygen species and increments of mitochondrial membrane potential. 
These effects of CTN are mediated via the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (NRF2) pathway in PD-hiNPCs. Consequently, CTN could be a potential 
antioxidant reagent for preventing disease-related pathological phenotypes of 
PD.
