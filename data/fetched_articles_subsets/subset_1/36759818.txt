BACKGROUND: Apatinib (YN968D1) is the first small-molecule-targeting drug with 
anti-tumor activity created in China for the treatment of advanced gastric 
cancer (GC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It showed significant variation 
in the efficacy for treating cancers, including advanced non-squamous 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whether its efficacy could be optimized by 
subgrouping patients with certain genetic variation remains elusive.
METHODS: Here, we firstly used kinase screening to identify any possible target 
of apatinib against 138 kinases. The effects of apatinib on proliferation rates, 
cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and cell migration on cancer cell lines were 
analyzed; the in vitro potential pathways of apatinib on cancer cell lines were 
screened. The effect of apatinib on mouse cancer models in vivo was also 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Based on HCC364 cells with BRAF V600E mutation, we have shown that 
apatinib could inhibit their growth, migration, cell cycle, and induce their 
apoptosis. Based on mice with transplanted HCC364 cells, we have also shown that 
apatinib could inhibit the tumor growth. Based on immunohistochemistry, we have 
demonstrated that apatinib could suppress the phosphorylation of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and 
extracellular regulated protein kinases. This may account at least part of the 
apatinib's inhibitory effect on HCC364 cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: BRAF V600E protein kinase is a target of apatinib by kinase 
screening. We have demonstrated that apatinib can effectively inhibit tumor 
cells with BRAF V600E mutation by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results 
have demonstrated that targeting BRAF V600E mutation, apatinib appears to be 
effective and safe for treating NSCLC and possibly other cancers with the same 
mutation.
