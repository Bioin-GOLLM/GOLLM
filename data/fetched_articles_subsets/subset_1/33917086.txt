Acral melanoma (AM) is a rare and aggressive subtype of melanoma affecting the 
palms, soles, and nail apparatus with similar incidence among different 
ethnicities. AM is unrelated to ultraviolet radiation and has a low mutation 
burden but frequent chromosomal rearrangements and gene amplifications. Next 
generation sequencing of 33 genes and somatic copy number variation (CNV) 
analysis with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism arrays were performed 
in order to molecularly characterize 48 primary AMs of Italian patients in 
association with clinicopathological and prognostic features. BRAF was the most 
commonly mutated gene, followed by NRAS and TP53, whereas TERT promoter, KIT, 
and ARID1A were less frequently mutated. Gains and losses were recurrently found 
in the 1q, 6p, 7, 8q, 20 and 22 chromosomes involving PREX2, RAC1, KMT2C, BRAF, 
CCND1, TERT, and AKT3 genes, and in the 6q, 9, 10, 11q and 16q chromosomes 
including CDKN2A, PTEN, and ADAMTS18 genes, respectively. This study confirmed 
the variety of gene mutations and the high load of CNV in primary AM. Some 
genomic alterations were associated with histologic prognostic features. BRAF 
mutations, found with a higher rate than previously reported, correlated with a 
low Breslow thickness, low mitotic count, low CNV of the AMs, and with 
early-stage of disease.
