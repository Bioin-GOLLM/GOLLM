The mouse vaginal epithelium cyclically exhibits cell proliferation and 
differentiation in response to estrogen. Estrogen acts as an activator of mTOR 
signaling but its role in vaginal epithelial homeostasis is unknown. We analyzed 
reproductive tract-specific Rptor or Rictor conditional knockout mice to reveal 
the role of mTOR signaling in estrogen-dependent vaginal epithelial cell 
proliferation and differentiation. Loss of Rptor but not Rictor in the vagina 
resulted in an aberrant proliferation of epithelial cells and failure of 
keratinized differentiation. As gene expression analysis indicated, several 
estrogen-mediated genes, including Pgr and Ereg (EGF-like growth factor) were 
not induced by estrogen in Rptor cKO mouse vagina. Moreover, supplementation of 
EREG could activate the proliferation and survival of vaginal epithelial cells 
through YAP1 in the absence of Rptor. Thus, mTORC1 signaling integrates estrogen 
and growth factor signaling to mediate vaginal epithelial cell proliferation and 
differentiation, providing new insights into vaginal atrophy treatment for 
post-menopausal women.
