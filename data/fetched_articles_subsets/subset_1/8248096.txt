Sequence variants of the beta-barrel protein interleukin-1 beta have been 
analyzed for their stabilities toward irreversible thermal inactivation by 
monitoring the generation of light scattering aggregates on heating. The derived 
temperatures for the onset of aggregation (T(agg) values) correlate well with 
the free energies of unfolding of these proteins with the exception of one 
variant, Lys97-->Val (K97V), which undergoes aggregation at a temperature 7 
degrees C lower than expected based on its thermodynamic stability. This lower 
than expected thermal stability may be due to generation of an aggregation-prone 
unfolding intermediate at a temperature lower than the Tm of the global 
transition. This hypothesis is supported by the location of residue 97 in the 
long 86-99 loop which has structural features suggesting it may comprise a 
small, independent folding unit or microdomain. The excellent correlation of 
thermal and thermodynamic stabilities of seven of the eight variants tested is 
consistent with accepted models for thermal inactivation of proteins. At the 
same time the poor fit of the K97V variant underscores the risk in using thermal 
stability data in quantitative analysis of mutational studies of the folding 
stability of proteins.
