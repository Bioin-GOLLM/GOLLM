KRAS is mutated in âˆ¼40% of colorectal cancer (CRC), and there are limited 
effective treatments for advanced KRAS mutant CRC. Therefore, it is crucial that 
downstream mediators of oncogenic KRAS continue to be studied. We identified 
p190RhoGAP as being phosphorylated in the DLD1 CRC cell line, which expresses a 
heterozygous KRAS G13D allele, and not in DKO4 in which the mutant allele has 
been deleted by somatic recombination. We found that a ubiquitous binding 
partner of p190RhoGAP, p120RasGAP (RasGAP), is expressed in much lower levels in 
DKO4 cells compared to DLD1, and this expression is regulated by KRAS. Rescue of 
RasGAP expression in DKO4 rescued Rho pathway activation and partially rescued 
tumorigenicity in DKO4 cells, indicating that the combination of mutant KRAS and 
RasGAP expression is crucial to these phenotypes. We conclude that RasGAP is an 
important effector of mutant KRAS in CRC.
