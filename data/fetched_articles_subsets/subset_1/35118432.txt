Current standard assays to analyze lymphocyte-mediated antitumor cytotoxicity 
employ radioisotopic or fluorescent labels. However, such assays are not 
suitable for real-time analysis. Here we describe a protocol that facilitates 
the analysis of lymphocyte-mediated toxicity using a label-free, impedance-based 
real-time cell analyzer. This analyzer measures cellular electrical impedance, 
expressed as the cell index value, noninvasively and continuously. In contrast 
with label-dependent assays, this protocol simultaneously generates real-time 
killing curves useful for quantifying lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity in real 
time. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please 
refer to Kanemaru et al. (2021).
