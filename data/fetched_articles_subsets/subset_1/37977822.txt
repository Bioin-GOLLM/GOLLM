The spliceosomal gene SF3B1 is frequently mutated in cancer. While it is known 
that SF3B1 hotspot mutations lead to loss of splicing factor SUGP1 from 
spliceosomes, the cancer-relevant SF3B1-SUGP1 interaction has not been 
characterized. To address this issue, we show by structural modeling that two 
regions flanking the SUGP1 G-patch make numerous contacts with the region of 
SF3B1 harboring hotspot mutations. Experiments confirmed that all the 
cancer-associated mutations in these regions, as well as mutations affecting 
other residues in the SF3B1-SUGP1 interface, not only weaken or disrupt the 
interaction but also alter splicing similarly to SF3B1 cancer mutations. 
Finally, structural modeling of a trimeric protein complex reveals that the 
SF3B1-SUGP1 interaction "loops out" the G-patch for interaction with the 
helicase DHX15. Our study thus provides an unprecedented molecular view of a 
protein complex essential for accurate splicing and also reveals that numerous 
cancer-associated mutations disrupt the critical SF3B1-SUGP1 interaction.
