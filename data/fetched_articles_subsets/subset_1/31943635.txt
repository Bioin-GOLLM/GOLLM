Amphiphilic surface groups play an important role in many biological processes. 
The synthesis of amphiphilic polyphenylene dendrimer branches (dendrons), 
providing alternating hydrophilic and lipophilic surface groups and one reactive 
ethynyl group at the core is reported. The amphiphilic surface groups serve as 
biorecognition units that bind to the surface of adenovirus 5 (Ad5), which is a 
common vector in gene therapy. The Ad5/dendron complexes showed high gene 
transduction efficiencies in coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-negative cells. 
Moreover, the dendrons offer incorporation of new functions at the dendron core 
by in situ post-modifications, even when bound to the Ad5 surface. Surfaces 
coated with these dendrons were analyzed for their blood-protein binding 
capacity, which is essential to predict their performance in the blood stream. A 
new platform for introducing bioactive groups to the Ad5 surface without 
chemically modifying the virus particles is provided.
