Genetics plays an important role in individual differences in food liking, which 
influences food choices and health. Sweet food liking is a complex trait and has 
been associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and related comorbidities. 
This genome-wide association study (GWAS) aimed to investigate the genetics of 
sweet food liking using two adult discovery cohorts (n = 1109, n = 373) and an 
independent replication cohort (n = 1073). In addition, we tested the 
association of our strongest result on parameters related to behaviour (food 
adventurousness (FA) and reward dependence (RD) and health status (BMI and blood 
glucose). The results demonstrate a novel strong association between the 
Regulator of G-Protein Signalling 9 (RGS9I) gene, strongest single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) rs58931966 (p-value 7.05 Ã— 10-9 in the combined sample of 
discovery and replication), and sweet food liking, with the minor allele (A) 
being associated with a decreased sweet food liking. We also found that the A 
allele of the rs58931966 SNP was associated with decreased FA and RD, and 
increased BMI and blood glucose (p-values < 0.05). Differences were highlighted 
in sex-specific analysis on BMI and glucose. Our results highlight a novel 
genetic association with food liking and are indicative of genetic variation 
influencing the psychological-biological drivers of food preference. If 
confirmed in other studies, such genetic associations could allow a greater 
understanding of chronic disease management from both a habitual dietary intake 
and reward-related perspective.
