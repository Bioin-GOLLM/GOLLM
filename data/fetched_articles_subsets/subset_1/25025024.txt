PURPOSE: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a severe and common complication that 
occurs after the major operation. Despite the commonality of DVT there is 
limited data on the incidence of DVT after kidney transplantation (KT). 
Furthermore, most studies have been retrospective in design and were conducted 
in western countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of 
lower extremity DVT with mechanical thromboprophylaxis within 1 month of KT in 
Korea.
METHODS: A total of 187 consecutive patients who underwent KT were included in 
this study. Patients used a graduated elastic stocking (n = 93) or an 
intermittent pneumatic compression device (n = 94) to prevent DVT. The frequency 
of DVT during the first month after KT was evaluated using serial color duplex 
ultrasound on postoperative days 7 ± 2, 14 ± 2, and 28 ± 3. All patients were 
tested for eight thrombophilic factors before KT.
RESULTS: DVT occurred in four patients (2.1%) during the first month after KT. 
All DVT developed in the graduated elastic stocking group. Interestingly, none 
of the patients had the factor V Leiden mutation or the prothrombin gene 20210A 
mutation.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of DVT in this study was relatively lower than that of 
western populations. We did not encounter a factor V Leiden mutation or a 
prothrombin gene 20210A mutation in our study population. These findings suggest 
that inherited thrombophilic risk factors may be partially responsible for the 
difference in DVT incidence rates between different nationalities and/or 
ethnicities.
