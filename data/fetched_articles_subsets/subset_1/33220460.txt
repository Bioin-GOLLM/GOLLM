Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a particular subtype of lung cancer with high 
mortality. Recent advances in understanding SCLC genomics and breakthroughs of 
immunotherapy have substantially expanded existing knowledge and treatment 
modalities. However, challenges associated with SCLC remain enigmatic and 
elusive. Most of the conventional drug discovery approaches targeting altered 
signaling pathways in SCLC end up in the 'grave-yard of drug discovery', which 
mandates exploring novel approaches beyond inhibiting cell signaling pathways. 
Epigenetic modifications have long been documented as the key contributors to 
the tumorigenesis of almost all types of cancer, including SCLC. The last decade 
witnessed an exponential increase in our understanding of epigenetic 
modifications for SCLC. The present review highlights the central role of 
epigenetic regulations in acquiring neoplastic phenotype, metastasis, 
aggressiveness, resistance to chemotherapy, and immunotherapeutic approaches of 
SCLC. Different types of epigenetic modifications (DNA/histone methylation or 
acetylation) that can serve as predictive biomarkers for prognostication, 
treatment stratification, neuroendocrine lineage determination, and development 
of potential SCLC therapies are also discussed. We also review the utility of 
epigenetic targets/epidrugs in combination with first-line chemotherapy and 
immunotherapy that are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical 
studies. Altogether, the information presents the inclusive landscape of SCLC 
epigenetics and epidrugs that will help to improve SCLC outcomes.
