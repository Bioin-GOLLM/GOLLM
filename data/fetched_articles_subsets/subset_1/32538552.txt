OBJECTIVE: The detection of prion seeding activity in CSF and olfactory mucosal 
brushings using real-time quaking-induced conversion assays allows highly 
accurate clinical diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. To gauge 
transmission risks associated with these biospecimens and their testing, we have 
bioassayed prion infectivity levels in patients' brain tissue, nasal brushings, 
and CSF, and assessed the pathogenicity of amplified products of real-time 
quaking-induced conversion assays seeded with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions.
METHODS: We obtained olfactory mucosal brushings and CSF from patients with a 
final diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease subtype MM1 (n = 3). 
Samples were inoculated intracerebrally into Tg66 transgenic mice that 
overexpress the homologous human 129M prion protein. The mice were evaluated for 
clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical evidence of prion infection.
RESULTS: Patients' brain tissue at 102 to 105 fold dilutions affected 47/48 Tg66 
mice. In contrast, maximum acutely tolerable doses of insoluble pellets from 
their olfactory mucosa brushings caused evidence of prion disease in only 4/28 
inoculated mice, and no effects were seen with 10-fold dilutions. No clinical 
prion disease was observed in mice inoculated with antemortem CSF samples or 
prion-seeded real-time quaking-induced conversion assay products.
INTERPRETATION: Pellets from patients' olfactory mucosa brushings 
had ≥10,000-fold lower infectivity per unit volume than brain tissue, while CSF 
lacked detectable infectivity. Nonetheless, the results suggest that appropriate 
precautions may be warranted in surgical interventions involving the olfactory 
areas. The lack of pathogenic infectivity in the real-time quaking-induced 
conversion assay products provides evidence that the assay does not replicate 
biohazardous prions in vitro.
