Poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP)i are emerging 
as standard oncology treatments in various tumor types. The indications will 
expand as PARPi are being investigated in various breast cancer subtypes. 
Currently, except for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, there is inadequate 
identification of predictive biomarkers of response. We present a 57-year-old 
woman with metastatic breast cancer, hormone-receptor-positive, HER2 negative 
with a germline ataxia-telangiectasia mutation with a large brain metastasis 
with clinical benefit to talazoparib. This case report exemplifies the 
importance of the multidisciplinary management of patients with brain metastases 
and personalized biomarker selected treatment.
