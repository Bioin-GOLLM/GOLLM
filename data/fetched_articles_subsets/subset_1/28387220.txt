Bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems comprise diverse effector endonucleases with 
different targeting ranges, specificities and enzymatic properties, but many of 
them are inactive in mammalian cells and are thus precluded from genome-editing 
applications. Here we show that the type II-B FnCas9 from Francisella novicida 
possesses novel properties, but its nuclease function is frequently inhibited at 
many genomic loci in living human cells. Moreover, we develop a proximal CRISPR 
(termed proxy-CRISPR) targeting method that restores FnCas9 nuclease activity in 
a target-specific manner. We further demonstrate that this proxy-CRISPR strategy 
is applicable to diverse CRISPR-Cas systems, including type II-C Cas9 and type V 
Cpf1 systems, and can facilitate precise gene editing even between identical 
genomic sites within the same genome. Our findings provide a novel strategy to 
enable use of diverse otherwise inactive CRISPR-Cas systems for genome-editing 
applications and a potential path to modulate the impact of chromatin 
microenvironments on genome modification.
