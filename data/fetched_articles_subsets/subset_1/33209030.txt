BACKGROUND: It is known that miR-532-5p is critical for neuronal 
differentiation. However, the role of miR-532-5p in depression remains unknown. 
This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of miR-532-5p in major 
depressive disorder (MDD).
METHODS: The depression mice model was established by chronic unpredictable mild 
stress (CUMS) and confirmed by forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference 
test (SPT). The role of miR-532-5p in MDD was detected by tail suspension test 
(TST), FST, SPT and SIT. QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-139-5p 
in hippocampus and BV-2 microglia of mice. ELISA and Western blotting were used 
to detect the expression of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS), proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1) and transcriptional activator 3 
(STAT3). Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the downstream target 
genes of miR-532-5p.
RESULTS: MiR-532-5p was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of mice treated 
with CUMS. Overexpression of miR-532-5p significantly reduced CUMS-induced 
depression-like behaviors and suppressed the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α 
and MCP-1. MiR-532-5p directly targeted signal transducers and STAT3 in BV2 
cells. In addition, overexpression of miR-532-5p restrained the raise of 
inducible NOS and IL-6, IL-1 β, TNF-α and MCP-1 in LPS-exposed BV2 cells.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that miR-532-5p plays an important role in 
CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors by targeting STAT3, and miR-532-5p may be 
a potential target for MDD therapy.
