Deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis from ribonucleotides supports the growth of 
active cancer cells by producing building blocks for DNA. Although 
ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is known to catalyze the rate-limiting step of de 
novo deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis, the biological function 
of the RNR large subunit (RRM1) in small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) remains 
unclear. In this study, we established siRNA-transfected SCLC cell lines to 
investigate the anticancer effect of silencing RRM1 gene expression. We found 
that RRM1 is required for the full growth of SCLC cells both in vitro and in 
vivo. In particular, the deletion of RRM1 induced a DNA damage response in SCLC 
cells and decreased the number of cells with S phase cell cycle arrest. We also 
elucidated the overall changes in the metabolic profile of SCLC cells caused by 
RRM1 deletion. Together, our findings reveal a relationship between the 
deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis axis and key metabolic changes in SCLC, which 
may indicate a possible link between tumor growth and the regulation of 
deoxyribonucleotide metabolism in SCLC.
