Lassa virus (LASV) is an Old World arenavirus, endemic to West Africa, capable 
of causing hemorrhagic fever. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or 
effective antivirals for LASV. However, thorough understanding of the LASV 
glycoprotein and entry into host cells could accelerate therapeutic design. LASV 
entry is a two-step process involving the viral glycoprotein (GP). First, the GP 
subunit 1 (GP1) binds to the cell surface receptor and the viral particle is 
engulfed into an endosome. Next, the drop in pH triggers GP rearrangements, 
which ultimately leads to the GP subunit 2 (GP2) forming a six-helix-bundle 
(6HB). The process of GP2 forming 6HB fuses the lysosomal membrane with the LASV 
envelope, allowing the LASV genome to enter the host cell. The aim of this study 
was to identify residues in GP2 that are crucial for LASV entry. To achieve 
this, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis on GP2 residues. We tested these 
mutant GPs for efficient GP1-GP2 cleavage, cell-to-cell membrane fusion, and 
transduction into cells expressing Î±-dystroglycan and secondary LASV receptors. 
In total, we identified seven GP2 mutants that were cleaved efficiently but were 
unable to effectively transduce cells: GP-L280A, GP-L285A/I286A, GP-I323A, 
GP-L394A, GP-I403A, GP-L415A, and GP-R422A. Therefore, the data suggest these 
residues are critical for GP2 function in LASV entry.
