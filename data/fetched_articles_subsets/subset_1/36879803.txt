Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation are most causes of 
early death in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Conditional 
cardiac-specific low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 
(LRP6)-knockout mice with connexin 43 (Cx43) reduction triggered the lethal 
ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, it is necessary for exploring whether LRP6 and 
its upstream genes circRNA1615 mediate the phosphorylation of Cx43 in VT of AMI. 
Here, we showed that circRNA1615 regulated the expression of LRP6 mRNA through 
sponge adsorption of miR-152-3p. Importantly, LRP6 interference fragments 
aggravated hypoxia injury of Cx43, while overexpression of LRP6 improved the 
phosphorylation of Cx43. Subsequently, interference with G-protein alpha subunit 
(Gαs) downstream of LRP6 further inhibited the phosphorylation of Cx43, along 
with increasing VT. Our results demonstrated that LRP6 upstream genes 
circRNA1615 controlled the damage effect and VT in AMI, and LRP6 mediated the 
phosphorylation of Cx43 via Gαs which played a role in VT of AMI.
