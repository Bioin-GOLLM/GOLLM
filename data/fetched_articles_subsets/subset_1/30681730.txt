BACKGROUND: There are no Indian studies on the association between filaggrin 
gene (FLG) mutations and any dermatosis, including hand eczema.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of FLG mutations in Indian hand eczema 
patients, and examine associations between such mutations and any aetiological 
type of hand eczema.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 163 patients and 86 controls were included. 
Patients were categorized into aetiological subtypes of hand eczema. FLG 
polymorphisms (S2889X, 2282del4, R501X, and Q2417X) were determined in patients 
and controls, and correlated with subtypes.
RESULTS: The prevalences of FLG mutations were 33.7% in cases and 3.5% in 
controls. Mutations in S2889X constituted 96.4% of all FLG mutations. No carrier 
of R501X and Q2417X mutations was identified. Among 55 patients with mutations, 
irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) with or without atopy was found in 22 
patients, allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) with or without atopy was found in 
12, and idiopathic hand eczema was found in 12. There was a significant 
association of FLG mutations with ICD with or without atopy, ACD without atopy, 
and idiopathic subtypes. FLG mutations were associated with more severe hand 
eczema.
CONCLUSIONS: S2889X mutation is commoner in patients than in controls. FLG 
polymorphisms are associated with specific subtypes of hand eczema and severe 
disease.
