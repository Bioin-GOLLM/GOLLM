Cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint allows completion of critical 
macromolecular events prior to S phase. Regulators of the G1 checkpoint include 
an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, p16INK4; two tumor-suppressor proteins, 
p53 and RB (the product of the retinoblastoma-susceptibility gene); and cyclin 
D1. Neither p16INK4 nor the RB protein was detected in 28 of 29 tumor cell lines 
from human lung, esophagus, liver, colon, and pancreas. The presence of p16INK4 
protein is inversely correlated with detectable RB or cyclin D1 proteins and is 
not correlated with p53 mutations. Homozygous deletions of p16INK4 were detected 
in several cell lines, but intragenic mutations of this gene were unusual in 
either cell lines or primary tumors. Transfection of the p16INK4 cDNA expression 
vector into carcinoma cells inhibits their colony-forming efficiency and the 
p16INK4 expressing cells are selected against with continued passage in vitro. 
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that p16INK4 is a 
tumor-suppressor protein and that genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in genes 
controlling the G1 checkpoint can lead to both escape from senescence and cancer 
formation.
