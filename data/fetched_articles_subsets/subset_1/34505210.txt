The development of methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy has 
greatly facilitated the study of macromolecular assemblies by solution NMR 
spectroscopy. However, limited sample solubility and stability has hindered 
application of this technique to ongoing studies of complexes formed on 
membranes by the neuronal SNAREs that mediate neurotransmitter release and 
synaptotagmin-1, the Ca2+ sensor that triggers release. Since the 1H NMR signal 
of a tBu group attached to a large protein or complex can be observed with high 
sensitivity if the group retains high mobility, we have explored the use of this 
strategy to analyze presynaptic complexes involved in neurotransmitter release. 
For this purpose, we attached tBu groups at single cysteines of fragments of 
synaptotagmin-1, complexin-1 and the neuronal SNAREs by reaction with 
5-(tert-butyldisulfaneyl)-2-nitrobenzoic acid (BDSNB), tBu iodoacetamide or tBu 
acrylate. The tBu resonances of the tagged proteins were generally sharp and 
intense, although tBu groups attached with BDSNB had a tendency to exhibit 
somewhat broader resonances that likely result because of the shorter linkage 
between the tBu and the tagged cysteine. Incorporation of the tagged proteins 
into complexes on nanodiscs led to severe broadening of the tBu resonances in 
some cases. However, sharp tBu resonances could readily be observed for some 
complexes of more than 200 kDa at low micromolar concentrations. Our results 
show that tagging of proteins with tBu groups provides a powerful approach to 
study large biomolecular assemblies of limited stability and/or solubility that 
may be applicable even at nanomolar concentrations.
