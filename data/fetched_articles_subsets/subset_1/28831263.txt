Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment and outcomes 
of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Despite their significant impact on the 
management of CML, there is growing evidence that TKIs may cause cardiovascular 
and/or metabolic complications. In this review, we present the current evidence 
regarding the cardiovascular safety profiles of BCR-ABL TKIs. Methodological 
challenges of studies that reported the cardiovascular safety of TKIs are 
discussed. We also propose management strategies for cardiovascular surveillance 
and risk factor modification during treatment with these agents.
