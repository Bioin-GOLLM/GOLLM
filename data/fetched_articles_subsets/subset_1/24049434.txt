PURPOSE: Alström syndrome (AS) is a rare monogenic autosomal recessively 
inherited disorder characterized by cone rod dystrophy and multiple organ 
dysfunction. Mutations in the Alström syndrome 1 (ALMS1) gene have been found to 
be causative for AS. The purpose of this study was to identify ALMS1 mutations 
and to assess the clinical features of Chinese patients with AS.
METHODS: Detailed ocular and laboratory examinations were performed. Peripheral 
blood samples were collected from patients and their parents. Genomic DNA was 
extracted with a Qiagen kit. Exons and exon/intron junctions of ALMS1 were 
amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened for mutations with 
Sanger sequencing. The results were compared with the ALMS1 transcript to 
exclude polymorphisms and confirm pathogenic mutations.
RESULTS: Seven patients from five unrelated non-consanguineous families were 
diagnosed with AS. All patients had cone rod dystrophy with impaired visual 
acuity, photophobia, and nystagmus. Other clinical features, including 
sensorineural hearing loss, truncal obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, renal and hepatic dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, mental 
retardation, acanthosis nigricans, and scoliosis, were present. Sequencing 
revealed two novel mutations, p.N3150Kfs2X and p.V3154Xfs, in patient 1; one 
novel mutation, p.N3672Ifs11X, and one previously reported nonsense mutation, 
p.R3703X, in patient 2; novel mutations p.S2479X and p.R3611Efs7X in patient 3; 
one novel homozygous mutation, p.S695X, in patients 4 and 5; and two novel 
mutations, p.H688HfsX and p.Q3147Qfs2X, in patients 6 and 7. These mutations 
were not present in 100 unrelated healthy Chinese control subjects. The 
patients' parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutant allele.
CONCLUSIONS: Seven Chinese patients with AS showed typical ophthalmic features 
and multiple organ dysfunction. Novel loss of function mutations in the ALMS1 
gene are the underlying genetic defects.
