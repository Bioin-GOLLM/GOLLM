BACKGROUND: The gene FOXO3, encoding the transcription factor forkhead box O-3 
(FoxO3), is one of only two for which genetic polymorphisms have exhibited 
consistent associations with longevity in diverse human populations.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we review the multitude of actions of FoxO3 that are relevant 
to health, and thus healthy ageing and longevity.
METHODS: The study involved a literature search for articles retrieved from 
PubMed using FoxO3 as keyword.
RESULTS: We review the molecular genetics of FOXO3 in longevity, then current 
knowledge of FoxO3 function relevant to ageing and lifespan. We describe how 
FoxOs are involved in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, proteostasis, 
apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, metabolic processes, immunity, inflammation 
and stem cell maintenance. The single FoxO in Hydra confers immortality to this 
fresh water polyp, but as more complex organisms evolved, this role has been 
usurped by the need for FoxO to control a broader range of specialized pathways 
across a wide spectrum of tissues assisted by the advent of as many as 4 FoxO 
subtypes in mammals. The major themes of FoxO3 are similar, but not identical, 
to other FoxOs and include regulation of cellular homeostasis, particularly of 
stem cells, and of inflammation, which is a common theme of age-related 
diseases. Other functions concern metabolism, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, 
destruction of potentially damaging reactive oxygen species and proteostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism by which longevity-associated alleles of FOXO3 reduce 
age-related mortality is currently of great clinical interest. The prospect of 
optimizing FoxO3 activity in humans to increase lifespan and reduce age-related 
diseases represents an exciting avenue of clinical investigation. Research 
strategies directed at developing therapeutic agents that target FoxO3, its gene 
and proteins in the pathway(s) FoxO3 regulates should be encouraged and 
supported.
