Malignant cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a potentially lethal form of skin cancer 
whose worldwide incidence has been constantly increasing over the past decades. 
During their lifetime, about 8% of CM patients will develop multiple primary 
melanomas (MPMs), usually at a young age and within 3 years from the first 
tumor/diagnosis. With the aim of improving our knowledge on MPM biology and 
pathogenesis, we explored the miRNome of 24 single and multiple primary 
melanomas, including multiple tumors from the same patient, using a small 
RNA-sequencing approach. From a supervised analysis, 22 miRNAs were 
differentially expressed in MPM compared to single CM, including key miRNAs 
involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The first and second melanoma 
from the same patient presented a different miRNA profile. Ten miRNAs, including 
miR-25-3p, 149-5p, 92b-3p, 211-5p, 125a-5p, 125b-5p, 205-5p, 200b-3p, 21-5p, and 
146a-5p, were further validated in 47 single and multiple melanoma samples. 
Pathway enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes revealed a more differentiated 
and less invasive status of MPMs compared to CMs. Bioinformatic analyses at the 
miRNA isoform (isomiR) level detected a panel of highly expressed isomiRs 
belonging to miRNA families implicated in human tumorigenesis, including 
miR-200, miR-30, and miR-10 family. Moreover, we identified hsa-miR-125a-5p|0|-2 
isoform as tenfold over-represented in melanoma than the canonical form and 
differentially expressed in MPMs arising in the same patient. Target prediction 
analysis revealed that the miRNA shortening could change the pattern of target 
gene regulation, specifically in genes implicated in cell adhesion and neuronal 
differentiation. Overall, we provided a putative and comprehensive 
characterization of the miRNA/isomiR regulatory network of MPMs, highlighting 
mechanisms of tumor development and molecular features differentiating this 
subtype from single melanomas.
