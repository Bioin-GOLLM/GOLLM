Using the North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium (NARAC) candidate gene 
and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets, we applied 
regression methods and tree-based random forests to identify genetic 
associations with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to predict RA disease status. 
Several genes were consistently identified as weakly associated with RA without 
a significant interaction or combinatorial effect with other candidate genes. 
Using random forests, the tested candidate gene SNPs were not sufficient to 
predict RA patients and normal subjects with high accuracy. However, using the 
top 500 SNPs, ranked by the importance score, from the genome-wide linkage panel 
of 5742 SNPs, we were able to accurately predict RA patients and normal subjects 
with sensitivity of approximately 90% and specificity of approximately 80%, 
which was confirmed by five-fold cross-validation. However, in a complete 
training-testing framework, replication of genetic predictors was less 
satisfactory; thus, further evaluation of existing methodology and development 
of new methods are warranted.
