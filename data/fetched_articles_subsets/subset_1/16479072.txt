Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels are increased in scalp lesions 
of patients with alopecia areata (AA), suggesting a role in the development of 
AA. Recently, a biallelic A/G polymorphism in the MCP-1 promoter at position 
-2518 has been found, influencing the level of MCP-1 expression in response to 
an inflammatory stimulus. We investigated whether the presence of these 
polymorphisms were associated with AA in Korean population. 145 Korean patients 
with AA, 246 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of AA were screened for 
genotype with a PCR-based assay. In the AA patients the frequency of the A and G 
alleles was 40.3 and 59.7%, respectively and the distribution of the A/A, A/G 
and G/G genotypes was 19.3, 42.1 and 38.6%, respectively. Amongst the controls 
the frequency of the A and G alleles was 39.8 and 60.2%, and the distribution of 
the A/A, A/G, G/G genotypes in the same group was 17.5, 44.7 and 37.8%, 
respectively. There was no significant difference in the allele frequencies and 
genotype distributions between the patients and the controls (p=0.889, p=0.848, 
respectively). Our data indicates that no association exists between the 
-2518A/G polymorphism of the MCP-1 gene and susceptibility to alopecia areata.
