INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is a chronic inflammatory state, and a key role of 
lncRNAs in diabetes complications is a new area of research.
METHODS: In this study, key lncRNAs related to diabetes inflammation were 
identified by RNA-chip mining and lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network construction 
and finally verified by RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: We ultimately obtained 12 genes, including A1BG-AS1, AC084125.4, 
RAMP2-AS1, FTX, DBH-AS1, LOXL1-AS1, LINC00893, LINC00894, PVT1, RUSC1-AS1, 
HCG25, and ATP1B3-AS1. RT-qPCR assays verified that LOXL1-AS1, A1BG-AS1, FTX, 
PVT1, and HCG25 were upregulated in the HG+LPS-induced THP-1 cells, and 
LINC00893, LINC00894, RUSC1-AS1, DBH-AS1, and RAMP2-AS1 were downregulated in 
the HG+LPS-induced THP-1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: lncRNAs and mRNAs are extensively linked and form a coexpression 
network, and lncRNAs may influence the development of type 2 diabetes by 
regulating the corresponding mRNAs. The ten key genes obtained may become 
biomarkers of inflammation in type 2 diabetes in the future.
