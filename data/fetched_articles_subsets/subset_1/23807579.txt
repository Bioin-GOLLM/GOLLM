Spatholobus suberectus Dunn, belonging to the legume family (Fabaceae), has been 
used as a Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of anemia, menoxenia 
and rheumatism. A limited number of studies report that various types of 
flavonoids are the main characteristic constituents of this herb. We have now 
found that S. suberectus contains about 2% phenolic components and characterized 
the major phenolic components as homogeneous B-type procyanidin conjugates using 
a liquid chromatography with diode-array detection-ESI mass spectrometry 
(LC-DAD/ESI-MS) method. This is the first report on occurrence of most B-type 
procyanidins in this herb. Moreover, the total phenolics extract was assayed for 
inhibitory activity on human neutrophil elastase and its IC₅₀ was found to be 
1.33 μg/mL.
