Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited autosomal-recessive disorder 
characterized by abnormal ciliary motion, due to a defect in ciliary structure 
and/or function. This genetic condition leads to recurrent upper and lower 
respiratory infections, bronchiectasis, laterality defect, and subfertility. 
Male infertility is often associated with PCD, since the ultrastructure of the 
axoneme in the sperm tail is similar to that of the motile cilia of respiratory 
cells. We present the first reported case of a male patient from a 
non-consanguineous Italian family who exhibited a severe form of 
asthenozoospermia factor infertility but no situs inversus and absolutely no 
signs of the clinical respiratory phenotype, the proband being a professional 
basketball player. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has identified a homozygote 
mutation (CCDC103 c.461 A>C, p.His154Pro) in the proband, while his brother was 
a heterozygous carrier for this mutation. Morphological and ultrastructural 
analyses of the axoneme in the sperm flagellum demonstrated the complete loss of 
both the inner and outer dynein arms (IDA and ODA, respectively). Moreover, 
immunofluorescence of DNAH1, which is used to check the assembly of IDA, and 
DNAH5, which labels ODA, demonstrated that these complexes are absent along the 
full length of the flagella in the spermatozoa from the proband, which was 
consistent with the IDA and ODA defects observed. Noteworthy, TEM analysis of 
the axoneme from respiratory cilia showed that dynein arms, although either IDAs 
and/or ODAs seldom missing on some doublets, are still partly present in each 
observed section. This case reports the total sperm immotility associated with 
the CCDC103 p.His154Pro mutation in a man with a normal respiratory phenotype 
and enriches the variant spectrum of ccdc103 variants and the associated 
clinical phenotypes in PCD, thus improving counseling of patients about their 
fertility and possible targeted treatments.
