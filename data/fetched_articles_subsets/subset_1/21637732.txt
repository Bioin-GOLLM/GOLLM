Retroviral infections cause a variety of cancers in animals and a number of 
diverse diseases in humans such as leukemia and acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. Productive and efficient proviral integration is critical for 
retroviral function and is the key step in establishing a stable and productive 
infection, as well as the mechanism by which host genes are activated in 
leukemogenesis. Host factors are widely anticipated to be involved in all stages 
of the retroviral life cycle, and the identification of integrase interacting 
factors has the potential to increase our understanding of mechanisms by which 
the incoming virus might appropriate cellular proteins to target and capture 
host DNA sequences. Identification of MoMLV integrase interacting host factors 
may be key to designing efficient and benign retroviral-based gene therapy 
vectors; key to understanding the basic mechanism of integration; and key in 
designing efficient integrase inhibitors. In this review, we discuss current 
progress in the field of MoMLV integrase interacting proteins and possible roles 
for these proteins in integration.
