AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term 
intra-individual variability in fasting glucose (FG) during young adulthood is 
associated with incident diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality.
METHODS: We included participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in 
Young Adults (CARDIA) study, ages 18-30 years at baseline (1985-1986) and 
followed with eight examinations for up to 30 years. Long-term glucose 
variability was assessed using the CV (CV-FG) and the absolute difference 
between successive FG measurements (average real variability; ARV-FG). For 
participants who developed any event (diabetes, CVD or mortality), FG 
variability measurement was censored at the examination prior to event 
ascertainment. We estimated HRs for incident diabetes, CVD and mortality with 
adjustment for demographics, baseline FG, change in FG (censor - baseline) and 
time-varying education, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, 
systolic BP, BP medications, LDL-cholesterol and cholesterol medications (and 
incident diabetes and diabetes medications for CVD and mortality outcomes).
RESULTS: Among 3769 black and white participants, there were 317 incident 
diabetes cases (102,677 person-years), 159 incident CVD events (110,314 
person-years) and 174 deaths (111,390 person-years). After adjustment, HRs per 1 
SD higher ARV-FG were 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.78) for diabetes, 1.15 (95% CI 1.01, 
1.31) for CVD and 1.25 (95% CI 1.11, 1.40) for mortality. The HRs per 1 SD 
higher CV-FG were 1.39 (95% CI 1.21, 1.58) for diabetes, 1.32 (95% CI 1.13, 
1.54) for CVD and 1.08 (95% CI 0.92, 1.27) for mortality, after adjustment. The 
cause-specific HRs per 1 SD higher ARV-FG were 1.29 (95% CI 1.14, 1.47) for 
non-CVD death and 1.05 (95% CI 0.76, 1.45) for CVD death. We did not observe 
evidence for effect modification of any association by sex or race.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that higher intra-individual FG 
variability during young adulthood before the onset of diabetes is associated 
with incident diabetes, CVD and mortality.
