This paper presents three markers, 16D/E, pHMAI (DXS208), and CRI-L1391 
(DXS274), that show close linkage for X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets (HYP). 
DXS274 is closely linked to HYP (theta max = 0.00, Zmax = 4.20), and DXS41 
(99.6), (theta max = 0.00, Zmax = 5.20). Marker 16D/E maps distal to the disease 
locus (theta max = 0.05, Zmax = 3.11). The pHMAI probe recognises the same 
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) as 99.6. Multipoint analysis 
suggests that the most probable order of loci is Xpter-(DXS43, 
16D/E)-HYP-DXS274-(DXS208, DXS41)-Xcen. The location of DXS274 distal to HYP 
cannot be excluded, as no recombinants were observed between DXS274 and HYP, or 
between DXS274 and DXS41/DXS208. One of the families contains a large number of 
recombinants, four of which are double recombinants. This most probably means 
that the disease in this family maps elsewhere on the X chromosome or on an 
autosome, indicating locus heterogeneity.
