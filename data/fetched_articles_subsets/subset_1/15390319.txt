BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS), coarctation of the aorta (CoA), and 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) are obstructive malformations of the left 
ventricular outflow tract that account for a significant proportion of infant 
mortality. Two previous small case-control studies suggested 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms may be associated with 
this group of malformations.
METHODS: We used a family-based association design with inclusion criteria of 
nonsyndromic diagnosis of AVS, CoA, and HLHS, powered to detect an odds ratio 
for the heterozygote of <1.5. A total of 207 affected offspring-parent trios 
were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the two common 
polymorphic loci C677T and A1298C.
RESULTS: Error rate estimation based on replicate samples was 0.76%. Mendelian 
inconsistency at either polymorphism was noted in 10 trios, for a calculated 
undetected error rate of 1.95%. A total of 197 trios were analyzed using the 
transmission disequilibrium test. Significant association was not found between 
both the C677T or A1298C polymorphisms and presence of a heart defect, whether 
analyzed as a group, or by sex, ethnicity, or specific diagnosis. A log-linear 
analysis did not find increased relative risk based on the maternal genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to replicate previous association studies and 
concluded that neither the affected nor the maternal MTHFR genotype, by itself, 
is a major risk factor for congenital left ventricular outflow tract 
malformations.
