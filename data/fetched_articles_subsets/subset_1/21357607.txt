The knowledge that potential guanine quadruplex sequences (PQs) are non-randomly 
distributed in relation to genomic features is now well established. However, 
this is for a general potential quadruplex motif which is characterized by short 
runs of guanine separated by loop regions, regardless of the nature of the loop 
sequence. There have been no studies to date which map the distribution of PQs 
in terms of primary sequence or which categorize PQs. To this end, we have 
generated clusters of PQ sequence groups of various sizes and various degrees of 
similarity for the non-template strand of introns in the human genome. We 
started with 86â€‰697 sequences, and successively merged them into groups based on 
sequence similarity, carrying out 66 clustering cycles before convergence. We 
have demonstrated here that by using complete linkage hierarchical agglomerative 
clustering such PQ sequence categorization can be achieved. Our results give an 
insight into sequence diversity and categories of PQ sequences which occur in 
human intronic regions. We also highlight a number of clusters for which 
interesting relationships among their members were immediately evident and other 
clusters whose members seem unrelated, illustrating, we believe, a distinct role 
for different sequence types.
