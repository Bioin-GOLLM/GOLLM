DNA replication of the mitochondrial genome is unique in that replication is not 
primed by RNA derived from dedicated primases, but instead by extension of 
processed RNA transcripts laid down by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Thus, 
the RNA polymerase serves not only to generate the transcripts but also the 
primers needed for mitochondrial DNA replication. The interface between this 
transcription and DNA replication is not well understood but must be highly 
regulated and coordinated to carry out both mitochondrial DNA replication and 
transcription. This review focuses on the extension of RNA primers for DNA 
replication by the replication machinery and summarizes the current models of 
DNA replication in mitochondria as well as the proteins involved in 
mitochondrial DNA replication, namely, the DNA polymerase γ and its accessory 
subunit, the mitochondrial DNA helicase, the single-stranded DNA binding 
protein, topoisomerase I and IIIα and RNaseH1. This article is part of a Special 
Issue entitled: Mitochondrial Gene Expression.
