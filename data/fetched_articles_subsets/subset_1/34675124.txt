BACKGROUND: Joubert syndrome (JS) is a recessively inherited ciliopathy 
characterised by congenital ocular motor apraxia (COMA), developmental delay 
(DD), intellectual disability, ataxia, multiorgan involvement, and a unique 
cerebellar and brainstem malformation. Over 40 JS-associated genes are known 
with a diagnostic yield of 60%-75%.In 2018, we reported homozygous hypomorphic 
missense variants of the SUFU gene in two families with mild JS. Recently, 
heterozygous truncating SUFU variants were identified in families with 
dominantly inherited COMA, occasionally associated with mild DD and subtle 
cerebellar anomalies.
METHODS: We reanalysed next generation sequencing (NGS) data in two cohorts 
comprising 1097 probands referred for genetic testing of JS genes.
RESULTS: Heterozygous truncating and splice-site SUFU variants were detected in 
22 patients from 17 families (1.5%) with strong male prevalence (86%), and in 8 
asymptomatic parents. Patients presented with COMA, hypotonia, ataxia and mild 
DD, and only a third manifested intellectual disability of variable severity. 
Brain MRI showed consistent findings characterised by vermis hypoplasia, 
superior cerebellar dysplasia and subtle-to-mild abnormalities of the superior 
cerebellar peduncles. The same pattern was observed in two out of three tested 
asymptomatic parents.
CONCLUSION: Heterozygous truncating or splice-site SUFU variants cause a novel 
neurodevelopmental syndrome encompassing COMA and mild JS, which likely 
represent overlapping entities. Variants can arise de novo or be inherited from 
a healthy parent, representing the first cause of JS with dominant inheritance 
and reduced penetrance. Awareness of this condition will increase the diagnostic 
yield of JS genetic testing, and allow appropriate counselling about prognosis, 
medical monitoring and recurrence risk.
