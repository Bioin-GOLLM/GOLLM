We found no significant difference in cycle threshold values between vaccinated 
and unvaccinated persons infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 Delta, overall or stratified by symptoms. Given the substantial 
proportion of asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases with high viral levels, 
interventions, including masking and testing, should be considered in settings 
with elevated coronavirus disease 2019 transmission.
