Hamartomas are composed of cells native to an organ but abnormal in number, 
arrangement or maturity. In the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), hamartomas 
develop in multiple organs because of mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. Here we show 
that TSC2-null fibroblast-like cells grown from human TSC skin hamartomas 
induced normal human keratinocytes to form hair follicles and stimulated 
hamartomatous changes. Follicles were complete with sebaceous glands, hair 
shafts and inner and outer root sheaths. TSC2-null cells surrounding the hair 
bulb expressed markers of the dermal sheath and dermal papilla. Tumour 
xenografts recapitulated characteristics of TSC skin hamartomas with increased 
mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity, angiogenesis, 
mononuclear phagocytes and epidermal proliferation. Treatment with an mTORC1 
inhibitor normalized these parameters and reduced the number of tumour cells. 
These studies indicate that TSC2-null cells are the inciting cells for TSC skin 
hamartomas, and suggest that studies on hamartomas will provide insights into 
tissue morphogenesis and regeneration.
