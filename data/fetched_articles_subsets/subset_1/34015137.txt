OBJECTIVE: Pain severity and opioid requirements in the postoperative period 
show substantial and clinically significant inter-patient variation due mainly 
to factors such as age, surgery type, and duration. Genetic factors have not 
been adequately assessed except for the neuronal OPRM1 rs1799971 and COMT 
rs4680, whereas the contribution of innate immune signaling pathway genetics has 
seldom been investigated.
SETTING: Hospital surgical ward.
SUBJECTS: Women (107 Indian, 184 Malay, and 750 Han Chinese) undergoing total 
hysterectomy surgery.
METHODS: Morphine consumption, preoperative pain, and postoperative pain were 
evaluated in relation to genetic variability comprising 19 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes involved in glial activation, inflammatory 
signaling, and neuronal regulation, plus OPRM1 (1 SNP) and COMT (3 SNPs).
RESULTS: Pre- and postoperative pain and age were associated with increased and 
decreased morphine consumption, respectively. In Chinese patients, only 8% of 
the variability in consumption could be explained by these nongenetic and 
genetic (BDNF, IL1B, IL6R, CRP, OPRM1, COMT, MYD88) factors. However, in Indian 
patients, 41% of morphine consumption variability could be explained by age 
(explaining <3%) and variants in OPRM1 rs1799971, CRP rs2794521, TLR4 rs4986790, 
IL2 rs2069762, COMT rs4818, TGFB1 rs1800469, and IL6R rs8192284 without 
controlling for postoperative pain.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the highest known value reported for genetic contributions 
(38%) to morphine use in the acute postoperative pain setting. Our findings 
highlight the need to incorporate both genetic and nongenetic factors and 
consider ethnicity-dependent and nonadditive genotypic models in the assessment 
of factors that contribute to variability in opioid use.
