Unconscious and unplanned radiation exposures are a severe threat to gonads 
particularly ovaries. The present study aims at finding radioprotective effect 
of Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers root extract (TCRE) in ovaries. Swiss 
albino mice were divided into four groups: Group 1 served as "normal" and is 
administered double distilled water and Group 2 is given TCRE with optimum 
dosage selected as 75 mg/mice. Group 3 serving the purpose of "irradiated 
control" were exposed to 2.5 Gy gamma radiation. Group 4 (experimental) were 
administered optimum dosage of TCRE with prior exposure to 2.5 Gy gamma 
radiation. Follicle cell counts were scored at autopsy intervals of 24 hrs, 3 
days, 7 days, 15 days, and 30 days after gamma irradiation. To understand the 
mechanism of radioprotection, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione (GSH) 
levels were also measured in all groups. TCRE supplementation rendered 
significant protection to ovaries by restoring follicle counts; it also reduced 
LPO levels and increased GSH levels in ovaries. It implies that TCRE 
administration protects ovaries against radiation exposure.
