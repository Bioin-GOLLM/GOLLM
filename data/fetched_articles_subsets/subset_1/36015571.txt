The migration of plasticizers such as nitroglycerin seriously affects the 
storage and working safety of rocket systems. In this work, hydroxy-terminated 
polybutadiene (HTPB) liner composites with the cross-linked structure were 
prepared by cross-linking isocyanate functionalized graphene oxide (IGO) with 
HTPB to prevent the migration of high energy plasticizers in the propellant. IGO 
was uniformly dispersed in the matrix as reinforcement and cross-linker, 
providing good migration resistance and ablation resistance for the liner 
composites. Compared with pure HTPB, the migration resistance of the liner with 
0.5 wt% IGO increased by 18.94%, 16.33% and 15.34% at 25 °C, 60 °C and 90 °C, 
respectively. In addition, the ablation resistance of the HTPB liner was 
improved by the addition of IGO. The improved anti-migration properties come 
from the special laminar structure of IGO and the dense molecular chains network 
of the cross-linked composites.
