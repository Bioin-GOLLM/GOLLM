We studied viral evolution in five human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 patients 
recently infected with HIV-1. Escape mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag 
epitopes were present at study entry in all patients, but were not associated 
with significant increases in viremia. Conversely, no new escape mutations in 
HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes or known compensatory mutations were detected in 
patients who experienced significant increases in viremia. Thus, the development 
of escape mutations alone does not determine virologic outcome in recently 
infected HLA-B*57 patients.
