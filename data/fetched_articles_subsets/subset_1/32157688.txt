A congenital disorder of glycosylation due to biallelic mutations in B4GALT1 has 
been previously reported in only three patients with two different mutations. 
Through homozygosity mapping followed by segregation analysis in an extended 
pedigree, we identified three additional patients homozygous for a novel 
mutation in B4GALT1, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. The 
patients showed a uniform clinical presentation with intellectual disability, 
marked pancytopenia requiring chronic management, and novel features including 
pulmonary hypertension and nephrotic syndrome. Notably, affected individuals 
exhibited a moderate elevation of Man3GlcNAc4Fuc1 on serum N-glycan analysis, 
yet two of the patients had a normal pattern of transferrin glycosylation in 
repeated analysis. The novel mutation is the third disease-causing variant 
described in B4GALT1, and the first one within its transmembrane domain.
