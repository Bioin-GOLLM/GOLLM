BACKGROUND: This study is to determine the effect of the family-centered 
intervention (FCIS) on the key indicators of diabetes management and Control 
control in patients with type-2 diabetes.
METHOD: The present study is a quiz- experimental study with a randomized 
control group. Participants were 64 patients with type-2 diabetes visiting Ali 
Asghar Hospital of Isfahan in 2018. The eligible patients were assigned to 
either the intervention group or the control group (i.e., patient-center care) 
through block randomization. FCIS were implemented in 4 two-hour sessions as 
home visits while the patients and their caregivers were present. Data were 
collected twice-i.e. before the intervention and 12 weeks after it- and were 
analyzed, by running a t-test (α = 0.05), using SPSS-21.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD age of participants was 50.4 ± 8.5. There was no 
significant difference between the two groups in the mean weight, serum levels 
of FBS and A1C, physical activity, energy intake, and BMI before intervention. 
But, a significant improvement in the mean values of these variables in the 
intervention group after the intervention, compared with the control group was 
indicated (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that FCIS are more effective than 
patient-center care in the management and control of type-2 diabetes. Therefore, 
it is recommended that the family be considered in educational interventions.
