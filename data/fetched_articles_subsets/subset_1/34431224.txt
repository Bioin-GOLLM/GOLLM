Bispecific antibodies (bsAb) that target two independent epitopes or antigens 
have been extensively explored in translational and clinical studies since they 
were first developed in the 1960s. Many bsAbs are being tested in clinical 
trials for treating a variety of diseases, mostly cancer. Here, we provide an 
overview of various types of bsAbs in clinical studies and discuss their 
targets, safety profiles, and efficacy. We also highlight the current 
challenges, potential solutions, and future directions of bsAb development for 
cancer treatment.
