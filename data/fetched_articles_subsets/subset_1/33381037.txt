Autophagy is a catabolic process that targets its cargo for lysosomal 
degradation. In addition to its function in maintaining tissue homeostasis, 
autophagy is recognized to play a context-dependent role in cancer. Autophagy 
may inhibit tumor initiation under specific contexts; however, a growing body of 
evidence supports a pro-tumorigenic role of this pathway in established disease. 
In this setting, autophagy drives treatment resistance, metabolic changes, and 
immunosuppression both in a tumor-intrinsic and extrinsic manner. This 
observation has prompted renewed interest in targeting autophagy for cancer 
therapy. Novel genetic models have proven especially insightful, revealing 
unique and overlapping roles of individual autophagy-related genes in tumor 
progression. Despite identification of pharmacologically actionable nodes in the 
pathway, fundamental challenges still exist for successful therapeutic 
inhibition of autophagy. Here we summarize the current understanding of 
autophagy as a driver of resistance against targeted and immuno-therapies and 
highlight knowledge gaps that, if addressed, may provide meaningful advances in 
the treatment of cancer.
