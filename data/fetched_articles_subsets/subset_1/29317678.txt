Aberrant gene expression is a hallmark of acute leukemias. MYB-driven 
transcriptional coactivation with CREB-binding protein (CBP)/P300 is required 
for acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemias, including refractory 
MLL-rearranged leukemias. Using structure-guided molecular design, we developed 
a peptidomimetic inhibitor MYBMIM that interferes with the assembly of the 
molecular MYB:CBP/P300 complex and rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of AML 
cells. Treatment of AML cells with MYBMIM led to the dissociation of the 
MYB:CBP/P300 complex in cells, its displacement from oncogenic enhancers 
enriched for MYB binding sites, and downregulation of MYB-dependent gene 
expression, including of MYC and BCL2 oncogenes. AML cells underwent 
mitochondrial apoptosis in response to MYBMIM, which was partially rescued by 
ectopic expression of BCL2. MYBMIM impeded leukemia growth and extended survival 
of immunodeficient mice engrafted with primary patient-derived MLL-rearranged 
leukemia cells. These findings elucidate the dependence of human AML on 
aberrantÂ transcriptional coactivation, and establish a pharmacologic approach 
for its therapeutic blockade.
