The ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 gene (UCH-L1) has been implicated in 
the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). In several previous studies, an S18Y 
(C54A) polymorphism in exon 3 of the UCH-L1 gene has been found to be protective 
against PD. We performed polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism analysis for DNA samples from 408 Chinese patients with PD and 398 
Chinese healthy controls. For the S18Y variant, there was no significant 
difference either in the individual allele or genotype frequencies between cases 
and control subjects. Possession of the S18Y variant did not alter the risk of 
developing PD (odds ratio: 0.827; 95% confidence interval=0.596-1.147). There 
was no statistically significant difference in terms of age or sex distribution 
between the patients and controls (p>0.05). Overall, considering our present 
results together with those of our previous studies, we now have access to data 
from more than 1000 patients from different regions of China, supporting the 
conclusion that the S18Y polymorphism may not have a protective effect against 
PD in the Chinese population.
