Apicomplexa are unicellular eukaryotic pathogens that carry a vestigial algal 
endosymbiont, the apicoplast. The physiological function of the apicoplast and 
its integration into parasite metabolism remain poorly understood and at times 
controversial. We establish that the Toxoplasma apicoplast membrane-localized 
phosphate translocator (TgAPT) is an essential metabolic link between the 
endosymbiont and the parasite cytoplasm. TgAPT is required for fatty acid 
synthesis in the apicoplast, but this may not be its most critical function. 
Further analyses demonstrate that TgAPT also functions to supply the apicoplast 
with carbon skeletons for additional pathways and, indirectly, with energy and 
reduction power. Genetic ablation of the transporter results in rapid death of 
parasites. The dramatic consequences of loss of its activity suggest that 
targeting TgAPT could be a viable strategy to identify antiparasitic compounds.
