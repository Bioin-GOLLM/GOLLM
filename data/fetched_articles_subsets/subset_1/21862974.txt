The objective of this study was to assess the incidence, timing and identify 
pharmacogenetic, efavirenz (EFV) pharmacokinetic and biochemical predictors of 
EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug-induced liver injury (DILI). 
ART-naïve HIV patients (n = 285) were prospectively enrolled. Pretreatment 
laboratory evaluations included hepatitis B surface antigen and C antibody, CD4 
count and viral load. Liver tests were done at baseline, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 
12th, 24th and 48th weeks during ART. Plasma EFV and 8-hydroxyefvairenz 
concentration was determined at week 4 using liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. CYP2B6, CYP3A5, ABCB1 3435C/T and UGT2B7*2 genotyping was done 
using Taqman genotyping assay. Data were analyzed using survival analysis and 
Cox proportional hazards model. The incidence of DILI was 15.7% or 27.9 per 100 
person-years and that of severe injury was 3.4% or 6.13 per 100 person-years. 
The median time for the development of DILI and severe injury was 2 and 4 weeks 
after initiation of ART, respectively. There was significant association of DILI 
with lower baseline platelet, albumin, log plasma viral load and CD4 count (P = 
0.031, 0.037, 0.06 and 0.019, respectively). Elevated baseline alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, plasma EFV 
level and CYP2B6*6 were good predictors for the development of DILI (P = 0.03, 
0.01, 0.016, 0.017 and 0.04, respectively). We report for the first time 
CYP2B6*6 as a putative genetic marker and high plasma EFV concentration as 
intermediate biomarker for vulnerability to EFV-induced liver injury in HIV 
patients. CYP2B6 genotyping and/or regular monitoring of EFV and lever enzymes 
level during early therapy is advised for early diagnosis and management of 
DILI.
