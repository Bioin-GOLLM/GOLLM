BACKGROUND: Cowden syndrome (CS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome associated 
with increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, and is 
characterized by development of benign mucocutaneous lesions.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report on a 58-year-old woman with multiple primary 
malignancies and subtle mucocutaneous lesions such as small polyps and wart-like 
papulas. Over a period of 23 years, she developed various malignant neoplasms 
including thyroid, ovarian, stomach, and colon carcinomas, and a benign 
meningioma. Direct sequencing analysis of the PTEN gene revealed a novel 
germline mutation (c.438delT, p.Leu146X).
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that Cowden syndrome is a multi-system 
disease that can result in the development of multiple malignant and benign 
tumors.
