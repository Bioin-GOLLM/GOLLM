Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the main triggers of 
drug hypersensitivity reactions, probably due to their high consumption 
worldwide. The most frequent type of NSAID hypersensitivity is NSAID 
cross-hypersensitivity, in which patients react to NSAIDs from different 
chemical groups in the absence of a specific immunological response. The 
underlying mechanism of NSAID cross-hypersensitivity has been linked to 
cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition causing an imbalance in the arachidonic acid 
pathway. Despite NSAID-induced acute urticaria/angioedema (NIUA) being the most 
frequent clinical phenotype, most studies have focused on NSAID-exacerbated 
respiratory disease. As NSAID cross-hypersensitivity reactions are 
idiosyncratic, only appearing in some subjects, it is believed that individual 
susceptibility is under the influence of genetic factors. Although associations 
with polymorphisms in genes from the AA pathway have been described, no previous 
study has evaluated the potential role of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) 
variants. This enzyme catalyzes the initial hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids 
to release AA, which can be subsequently metabolized into eicosanoids. Here, we 
analyzed for the first time the overall genetic variation in the cPLA2 gene 
(PLA2G4A) in NIUA patients. For this purpose, a set of tagging single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in PLA2G4A were selected using data from Europeans 
subjects in the 1,000 Genomes Project, and genotyped with the iPlex Sequenom 
MassArray technology. Two independent populations, each comprising NIUA patients 
and NSAID-tolerant controls, were recruited in Spain, for the purposes of 
discovery and replication, comprising a total of 1,128 individuals. Fifty-eight 
tagSNPs were successfully genotyped in the discovery cohort, of which four were 
significantly associated with NIUA after Bonferroni correction (rs2049963, 
rs2064471, rs12088010, and rs12746200). These polymorphisms were then genotyped 
in the replication cohort: rs2049963 was associated with increased risk for NIUA 
after Bonferroni correction under the dominant and additive models, whereas 
rs12088010 and rs12746200 were protective under these two inheritance models. 
Our results suggest a role for PLA2G4A polymorphisms in NIUA. However, further 
studies are required to replicate our findings, elucidate the mechanistic role, 
and evaluate the participation of PLA2G4A variants in other phenotypes induced 
by NSAID cross-hypersensitivity.
