Mitochondria and peroxisomes proliferate by division. During division, a part of 
their membrane is pinched off by constriction of the ring-shaped mitochondrial 
division (MD) and peroxisome-dividing (POD) machinery. This constriction is 
mediated by a dynamin-like GTPase Dnm1 that requires a large amount of GTP as an 
energy source. Here, via proteomics of the isolated division machinery, we show 
that the 17-kDa nucleoside diphosphate kinase-like protein, dynamin-based ring 
motive-force organizer 1 (DYNAMO1), locally generates GTP in MD and POD 
machineries. DYNAMO1 is widely conserved among eukaryotes and colocalizes with 
Dnm1 on the division machineries. DYNAMO1 converts ATP to GTP, and disruption of 
its activity impairs mitochondrial and peroxisomal fissions. DYNAMO1 forms a 
ring-shaped complex with Dnm1 and increases the magnitude of the constricting 
force. Our results identify DYNAMO1 as an essential component of MD and POD 
machineries, suggesting that local GTP generation in Dnm1-based machinery 
regulates motive force for membrane severance.
