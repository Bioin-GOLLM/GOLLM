The widespread of different NDM variants in clinical Enterobacterales isolates 
poses a serious public health concern, which requires continuous monitoring. In 
this study, three E. coli strains carrying two novel blaNDM variants of 
blaNDM-36, -37 were identified from a patient with refractory urinary tract 
infection (UTI) in China. We conducted antimicrobial susceptibility testing 
(AST), enzyme kinetics analysis, conjugation experiment, whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS), and bioinformatics analysis to characterize the blaNDM-36, -37 enzymes 
and their carrying strains. The blaNDM-36, -37 harboring E. coli isolates 
belonged to ST227, O9:H10 serotype and exhibited intermediate or resistance to 
all β-lactams tested except aztreonam and aztreonam/avibactam. The genes of 
blaNDM-36, -37 were located on a conjugative IncHI2-type plasmid. NDM-37 
differed from NDM-5 by a single amino acid substitution (His261Tyr). NDM-36 
differed from NDM-37 by an additional missense mutation (Ala233Val). NDM-36 had 
increased hydrolytic activity toward ampicillin and cefotaxime relative to 
NDM-37 and NDM-5, while NDM-37 and NDM-36 had lower catalytic activity toward 
imipenem but higher activity against meropenem in comparison to NDM-5. This is 
the first report of co-occurrence of two novel blaNDM variants in E. 
coli isolated from the same patient. The work provides insights into the 
enzymatic function and demonstrates the ongoing evolution of NDM enzymes.
