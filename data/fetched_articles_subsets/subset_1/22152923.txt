Primary intimal aortic sarcoma represents a very rare and highly lethal medical 
entity. Diagnosis is made either by embolic events caused by the tumor or by 
surrounding tissue symptoms such as pain. Herein we report an extremely rare 
case of a 51-year-old man previously operated for ascending aortic aneurysm, who 
presented with clinical and radiological findings suggestive of a ruptured 
thoracoabdominal type IV aneurysm. The patient underwent radical resection of 
the aorta and surrounding tissue with placement of a composite 4-branched graft. 
The diagnosis was made by frozen section and regular histopathologic examination 
of the specimen and the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. Nine months 
after surgery the patient is still alive and has no signs of recurrence. We 
review the literature and discuss the option of postoperative chemotherapy.
