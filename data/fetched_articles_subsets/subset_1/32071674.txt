Inhibitors of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (mIDH) 1 and 2 cancer-associated 
enzymes prevent the accumulation of the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate 
(2-HG) and are under clinical investigation for the treatment of several cancers 
harboring an IDH mutation. Herein, we describe the discovery of vorasidenib 
(AG-881), a potent, oral, brain-penetrant dual inhibitor of both mIDH1 and 
mIDH2. X-ray cocrystal structures allowed us to characterize the compound 
binding site, leading to an understanding of the dual mutant inhibition. 
Furthermore, vorasidenib penetrates the brain of several preclinical species and 
inhibits 2-HG production in glioma tissue by >97% in an orthotopic glioma mouse 
model. Vorasidenib represents a novel dual mIDH1/2 inhibitor and is currently in 
clinical development for the treatment of low-grade mIDH glioma.
