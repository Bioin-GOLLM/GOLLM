KIN (Kin17) protein is overexpressed in a number of cancerous cell lines, and is 
therefore considered a possible cancer biomarker. It is a well-conserved protein 
across eukaryotes and is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types studied, 
suggesting an important role in the maintenance of basic cellular function which 
is yet to be well determined. Early studies on KIN suggested that this nuclear 
protein plays a role in cellular mechanisms such as DNA replication and/or 
repair; however, its association with chromatin depends on its methylation 
state. In order to provide a better understanding of the cellular role of this 
protein, we investigated its interactome by proximity-dependent biotin 
identification coupled to mass spectrometry (BioID-MS), used for identification 
of protein-protein interactions. Our analyses detected interaction with a novel 
set of proteins and reinforced previous observations linking KIN to factors 
involved in RNA processing, notably pre-mRNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis. 
However, little evidence supports that this protein is directly coupled to DNA 
replication and/or repair processes, as previously suggested. Furthermore, a 
novel interaction was observed with PRMT7 (protein arginine methyltransferase 7) 
and we demonstrated that KIN is modified by this enzyme. This interactome 
analysis indicates that KIN is associated with several cell metabolism 
functions, and shows for the first time an association with ribosome biogenesis, 
suggesting that KIN is likely a moonlight protein.
