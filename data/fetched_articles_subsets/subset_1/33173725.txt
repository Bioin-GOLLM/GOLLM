The transcription factor SOX9 is frequently amplified in diverse advanced-stage 
human tumors. Its stability has been shown to be tightly controlled by 
ubiquitination-dependent proteasome degradation. However, the exact underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This work reports that SOX9 protein 
abundance is regulated by the Cullin 3-based ubiquitin ligase KEAP1 via 
proteasome-mediated degradation. Loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 compromise 
polyubiquitination-mediated SOX9 degradation, leading to increased protein 
levels, which facilitate tumorigenesis. Moreover, the loss of critical 
ubiquitination residues in SOX9, by either a SOX9 (ΔK2) truncation or K249R 
mutation, leads to elevated protein stability. Furthermore, it is shown that the 
KEAP1/SOX9 interaction is modulated by CKIγ-mediated phosphorylation. 
Importantly, it is demonstrated that DNA damage drugs, topoisomerase inhibitors, 
can trigger CKI activation to restore the KEAP1/SOX9 interaction and its 
consequent degradation. Collectively, herein the findings uncover a novel 
molecular mechanism through which SOX9 protein stability is negatively regulated 
by KEAP1 to control tumorigenesis. Thus, these results suggest that mitigating 
SOX9 resistance to KEAP1-mediated degradation can represent a novel therapeutic 
strategy for cancers with KEAP1 mutations.
