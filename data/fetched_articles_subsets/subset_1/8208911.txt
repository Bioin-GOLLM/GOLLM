It has been shown that myocardial infarction survivors are more likely to carry 
an insertion/deletion polymorphism (I/D) of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme 
(ACE) gene than age-matched population controls. To test whether the association 
with coronary risk had been under-estimated, the frequency of the ACE I/D was 
studied in 213 fatal cases of definite and possible myocardial infarction which 
came to autopsy in the Belfast MONICA Project area. In comparison to controls 
from the same population, the autopsy cases had an increased frequency of the 
ACE D allele (p < 0.02). The overall odds ratios were 2.2 for DD vs. II, and 1.8 
for ID vs II (test for trend p = 0.01). The findings bear out the hypothesis 
that the ACE I/D polymorphism is a risk factor for fatal myocardial infarction 
and sudden cardiac death.
