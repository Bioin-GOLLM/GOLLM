We report a rare case of sclerosing pneumocytoma occurring in a child with PTEN 
mutation. A 13-year-old female presented to the emergency department of an adult 
hospital following 2 to 3 days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. A 
primary lung lesion was discovered during her initial chest X-ray to rule out 
pneumonia. The patient underwent an uneventful thoracoscopic right upper lobe 
segmentectomy. The pathology demonstrated a sclerosing pneumocytoma of the lung. 
She tested positive for PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome with a pathogenic variant 
at c.388 C > T. The PTEN mutation was also identified in the sclerosing 
pneumocytoma. Further study of PTEN mutation in sclerosing pneumocytoma is 
warranted.
