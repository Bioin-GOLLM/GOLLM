Currently, time-consuming serial in vitro experimentation involving 
immunocytochemistry or radiolabeled materials is required to identify which of 
the numerous Rab-GTPases (Rab) and Rab-GTPase activating proteins (RabGAP) are 
capable of functional interactions. These interactions are essential for 
numerous cellular functions, and in silico methods of reducing in vitro trial 
and error would accelerate the pace of research in cell biology. We have 
utilized a combination of three-dimensional protein modeling and protein 
bioinformatics to identify domains present in Rab proteins that are predictive 
of their functional interaction with a specific RabGAP. The RabF2 and RabSF1 
domains appear to play functional roles in mediating the interaction between 
Rabs and RabGAPs. Moreover, the RabSF1 domain can be used to make in silico 
predictions of functional Rab/RabGAP pairs. This method is expected to be a 
broadly applicable tool for predicting protein-protein interactions where 
existing crystal structures for homologs of the proteins of interest are 
available.
