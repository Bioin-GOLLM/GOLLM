BACKGROUND: Clinical manifestations of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by 
Leishmania (Viannia) range from asymptomatic infection to self-limited, or 
chronic (non-healing) cutaneous lesions. Given the critical role of the immune 
response in the clinical outcome of CL, it is plausible that functional 
polymorphisms in immune-related genes contribute to define the clinical 
manifestations of human infection.
METHODS: DNA samples from a retrospective cohort of individuals from an endemic 
area of L. V. panamensis transmission in Colombia were used to determine the 
frequency of SNPs in TNFα, IL-10 and TLR4 genes. DNA samples were obtained from 
74 adult participants: 38 patients presenting chronic cutaneous leishmaniasis 
(CCL) and 36 individuals with asymptomatic infection. Genotyping of TNFα-308G/A, 
IL-10-819C/T, and TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile SNPs, was conducted by 
PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Allele, genotype frequencies and 
associations between SNPs and clinical groups were evaluated.
RESULTS: The A allele in TNFα-308G/A SNP was found more frequently in 
individuals with asymptomatic infection (16% vs 7%), whereas the CC genotype in 
IL-10-819 C/T SNP was more frequent in patients with CCL (34% vs. 27% in 
asymptomatic individuals). No differences in allele frequencies for TLR4 SNPs 
were found among groups.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a reference base for statistical power 
calculation and design of association studies of genetic polymorphisms in immune 
response related-genes and the pathogenesis of infections caused by L. V. 
panamensis.
