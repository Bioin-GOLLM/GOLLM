Heterochrony is a foundational concept in animal development and evolution, 
first introduced by Ernst Haeckel in 1875 and later popularized by Stephen J. 
Gould1. A molecular understanding of heterochrony was first established by 
genetic mutant analysis in the nematode C. elegans, revealing a genetic pathway 
that controls the proper timing of cellular patterning events executed during 
distinct postembryonic juvenile and adult stages2. This genetic pathway is 
composed of a complex temporal cascade of multiple regulatory factors, including 
the first-ever discovered miRNA, lin-4, and its target gene, lin-14, which 
encodes a nuclear, DNA-binding protein2,3,4. While all core members of the 
pathway have homologs based on primary sequences in other organisms, homologs 
for LIN-14 have never been identified by sequence homology. We report that the 
AlphaFold-predicted structure of the LIN-14 DNA binding domain is homologous to 
the BEN domain, found in a family of DNA binding proteins previously thought to 
have no nematode homologs5. We confirmed this prediction through targeted 
mutations of predicted DNA-contacting residues, which disrupt in vitro DNA 
binding and in vivo function. Our findings shed new light on potential 
mechanisms of LIN-14 function and suggest that BEN domain-containing proteins 
may have a conserved role in developmental timing.
