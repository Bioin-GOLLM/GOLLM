BACKGROUND: CDCA7 is a copy number amplified gene identified not only in 
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) but also in various cancer types. Its 
clinical relevance and underlying mechanisms in ESCC have remained unknown.
METHODS: Tissue microarray data was used to analyze its expression in 179 ESCC 
samples. The effects of CDCA7 on proliferation, colony formation, and cell cycle 
were tested in ESCC cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect 
the expression of its target genes. Correlation of CDCA7 with its target genes 
in ESCC and various SCC types was analyzed using GSE53625 and TCGA data. The 
mechanism of CDCA7 was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), 
luciferase reporter assays, and rescue assay.
RESULTS: The overexpression of CDCA7 promoted proliferation, colony formation, 
and cell cycle in ESCC cells. CDCA7 affected the expression of cyclins in 
different cell phases. GSE53625 and TCGA data showed CCNA2 expression was 
positively correlated with CDCA7. The knockdown of CCNA2 reversed the malignant 
phenotype induced by CDCA7 overexpression. Furthermore, CDCA7 was found to 
directly bind to CCNA2, thus promoting its expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a novel mechanism of CDCA7 that it may act as an 
oncogene by directly upregulating CCNA2 to facilitate tumor progression in ESCC.
