Oncogenic Ras proteins are implicated in the most common life-threatening 
cancers. Despite intense research over the past two decades, the progress 
towards small-molecule inhibitors has been limited. One reason for this failure 
is that Ras proteins interact with their effectors only via protein-protein 
interactions, which are notoriously difficult to address with small organic 
molecules. Herein we describe an alternative strategy, which prevents 
farnesylation and subsequent membrane insertion, a prerequisite for the 
activation of Ras proteins. Our approach is based on sequence-selective 
supramolecular receptors which bind to the C-terminal farnesyl transferase 
recognition unit of Ras and Rheb proteins and covalently modify the essential 
cysteine in the so-called CaaX-box.
