ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated, linear di-ubiquitin-like protein, with 
anti-viral activity. The role of ISG15 during bacterial infection remains 
elusive. We show that ISG15 expression in nonphagocytic cells is dramatically 
induced upon Listeria infection. Surprisingly this induction can be type I 
interferon independent and depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which 
senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. Most 
importantly, we observed that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in 
vitro and in vivo. We made use of stable isotope labeling in tissue culture 
(SILAC) to identify ISGylated proteins that could be responsible for the 
protective effect. Strikingly, infection or overexpression of ISG15 leads to 
ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins, which correlates with increased secretion 
of cytokines known to counteract infection. Together, our data reveal a 
previously uncharacterized ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection, 
reinforcing the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune 
response.
