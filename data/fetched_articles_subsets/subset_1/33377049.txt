Since its discovery, several ligands of the ZZ domain have been identified; 
however, molecular and structural information underlying binding of these 
ligands remains limited. Here, we describe a protocol for biochemical and 
structural analysis of the ZZ domain of human E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 
(HERC2ZZ) and its interaction with its ligands: the N-terminal tails of histone 
H3 and SUMO1. This methodology could be applied for characterization of binding 
activities of other histone readers. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Liu et al. (2020).
