Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a revolutionary sequencing technology for 
analyzing genomes. However, preprocessing methods for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
sequencing remain complex, and it is required to develop an authenticated 
preprocessing method. Here, we developed a simple and easy preprocessing method 
based on isothermal rolling circle mtDNA amplification using commercially 
available reagents. Isothermal amplification of mtDNA was successfully performed 
using both nanoliter quantities of plasma directly and 25â€‰ng of total DNA 
extracted from blood or tissue samples. Prior to mtDNA amplification, it was 
necessary to treat the extracted total DNA with Exonuclease V, but it was not 
required to treat plasma. The NGS libraries generated from the amplified mtDNA 
provided sequencing coverage of the entire human mitochondrial genome. 
Furthermore, the sequencing results successfully detected heteroplasmy in 
patient samples, with called mutations and variants matching those from 
previous, independent, Sanger sequencing analysis. Additionally, a novel single 
nucleotide variant was detected in a healthy volunteer. The successful analysis 
of mtDNA using very small samples from patients is likely to be valuable in 
clinical medicine, as it could reduce patient discomfort by reducing 
sampling-associated damage to tissues. Overall, the simple and convenient 
preprocessing method described herein may facilitate the future development of 
NGS-based clinical and forensic mtDNA tests.
