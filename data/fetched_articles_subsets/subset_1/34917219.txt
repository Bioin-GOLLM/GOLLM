BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) plays multiple roles regulating the central 
nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the role of NO in the efficacy of 
hypertonic saline (7.5% sodium chloride [NaCl]) adenosine, lidocaine, and 
magnesium (ALM) to improve mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate following 
hemorrhagic shock.
METHODS: One hundred one male Sprague-Dawley rats (mean [SD] weight = 425 [6] g) 
were randomly assigned to 20 groups (groups of 4-8 rats each). Hemorrhagic shock 
(MAP < 40 mm Hg) was induced by 20-minute pressure-controlled bleeding (∼40% 
blood volume), and the animal was left in shock (MAP = 35-40 mm Hg) for 60 
minutes. The NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NAME was administered with a 0.3-mL 
bolus of different combinations of 7.5% NaCl ALM active ingredients and 
hemodynamic parameters were monitored for 60 minutes. A number of specific NOS 
and NO inhibitors were tested.
RESULTS: We found that 7.5% NaCl ALM corrected MAP after hemorrhagic shock. In 
contrast, the addition of L-NAME to 7.5% NaCl ALM led to a rapid fall in MAP, 
sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and 100% mortality. Saline controls receiving 
7.5% NaCl with NG -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) showed improved MAP 
with no deaths. None of the specific NOS and NO inhibitors mimicked L-NAME's 
effect on ALM. The addition of inducible NOS inhibitor 1400W to 7.5% NaCl ALM 
failed to resuscitate, whereas the NO scavenger PTIO and the PI3K inhibitor 
wortmannin reduced MAP recovery during 60-minute resuscitation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of 7.5% NaCl ALM to resuscitate appears to be linked to 
1 or more NO-producing pathways. Nonspecific NOS inhibition with L-NAME blocked 
ALM resuscitation and led to cardiovascular collapse. More studies are required 
to examine NO site-specific contributions to ALM resuscitation. (Curr Ther Res
