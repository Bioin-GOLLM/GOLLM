INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is 
the leading cause of cancer death. Smoking is a major contributor to the 
pathogenesis of lung cancer. Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) is responsible for the 
metabolic activation of most tobacco carcinogens. CYP2A6 genetic polymorphism 
can cause variations in the human metabolism of xenobiotics. We performed this 
meta-analysis to determine the association between whole-gene CYP2A6 deletion 
polymorphism (CYP2A6*4) and lung cancer risk.
METHODS: The PubMed, SAGE, Science Direct, the Cochrane Library and Ovid 
databases were searched for observational studies before October 2018. 
Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality 
Assessment Scale (NOS).
RESULTS: Nine case-control studies involving 4385 lung cancer cases and 4142 
controls were included in the analysis. The random-effects model was used to 
combine results from individual studies. The pooled odds ratio was 0.39 (95% CI: 
0.27-0.56). There was no heterogeneity across studies (χ2=2.49, p=0.96, I2=0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence from the case-control studies suggests that the 
CYP2A6 whole-gene deletion polymorphism decreases the risk of lung cancer. 
Further research is needed to identify any potential confounding factors that 
may impact this association.
