The cardiovascular benefits of fibrates have been shown to be heterogeneous and 
to depend on the presence of atherogenic dyslipidemia. We investigated whether 
genetic variability in the PPARA gene, coding for the pharmacological target of 
fibrates (PPAR-α), could be used to improve the selection of patients with type 
2 diabetes who may derive cardiovascular benefit from addition of this treatment 
to statins. We identified a common variant at the PPARA locus (rs6008845, C/T) 
displaying a study-wide significant influence on the effect of fenofibrate on 
major cardiovascular events (MACE) among 3,065 self-reported white subjects 
treated with simvastatin and randomized to fenofibrate or placebo in the 
ACCORD-Lipid trial. T/T homozygotes (36% of participants) experienced a 51% MACE 
reduction in response to fenofibrate (hazard ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.34-0.72), 
whereas no benefit was observed for other genotypes (P interaction = 3.7 × 
10-4). The rs6008845-by-fenofibrate interaction on MACE was replicated in 
African Americans from ACCORD (N = 585, P = 0.02) and in external cohorts 
(ACCORD-BP, ORIGIN, and TRIUMPH, total N = 3059, P = 0.005). Remarkably, 
rs6008845 T/T homozygotes experienced a cardiovascular benefit from fibrate even 
in the absence of atherogenic dyslipidemia. Among these individuals, but not 
among carriers of other genotypes, fenofibrate treatment was associated with 
lower circulating levels of CCL11-a proinflammatory and atherogenic chemokine 
also known as eotaxin (P for rs6008845-by-fenofibrate interaction = 0.003). The 
GTEx data set revealed regulatory functions of rs6008845 on PPARA expression in 
many tissues. In summary, we have found a common PPARA regulatory variant that 
influences the cardiovascular effects of fenofibrate and that could be used to 
identify patients with type 2 diabetes who would derive benefit from fenofibrate 
treatment, in addition to those with atherogenic dyslipidemia.
