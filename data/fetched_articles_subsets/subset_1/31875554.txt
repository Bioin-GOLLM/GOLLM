During V(D)J recombination, RAG proteins introduce DNA double-strand breaks 
(DSBs) at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) that contain either 12- or 23-nt 
spacer regions. Coordinated 12/23 cleavage predicts that DSBs at variable (V) 
gene segments should equal the level of breakage at joining (J) segments. 
Contrary to this, here we report abundant RAG-dependent DSBs at multiple Vκ gene 
segments independent of V-J rearrangement. We find that a large fraction of Vκ 
gene segments are flanked not only by a bone-fide 12 spacer but also an 
overlapping, 23-spacer flipped RSS. These compatible pairs of RSSs mediate 
recombination and deletion inside the Vκ cluster even in the complete absence of 
Jκ gene segments and support a V(D)J recombination center (RC) independent of 
the conventional Jκ-centered RC. We propose an improved model of Vκ-Jκ 
repertoire formation by incorporating these surprisingly frequent, 
evolutionarily conserved intra-Vκ cluster recombination events.
