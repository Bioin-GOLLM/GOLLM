Gasdermins are a family of structurally related proteins originally described 
for their role in pyroptosis. Gasdermin B (GSDMB) is currently the least 
studied, and while its association with genetic susceptibility to chronic 
mucosal inflammatory disorders is well established, little is known about its 
functional relevance during active disease states. Herein, we report increased 
GSDMB in inflammatory bowel disease, with single-cell analysis identifying 
epithelial specificity to inflamed colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes. 
Surprisingly, mechanistic experiments and transcriptome profiling reveal lack of 
inherent GSDMB-dependent pyroptosis in activated epithelial cells and organoids 
but instead point to increased proliferation and migration during in vitro wound 
closure, which arrests in GSDMB-deficient cells that display hyper-adhesiveness 
and enhanced formation of vinculin-based focal adhesions dependent on 
PDGF-A-mediated FAK phosphorylation. Importantly, carriage of disease-associated 
GSDMB SNPs confers functional defects, disrupting epithelial restitution/repair, 
which, altogether, establishes GSDMB as a critical factor for restoration of 
epithelial barrier function and the resolution of inflammation.
