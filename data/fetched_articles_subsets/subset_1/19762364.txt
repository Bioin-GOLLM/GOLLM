OBJECTIVE: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is characterised by recurrent 
periodic febrile attacks and persistent subclinical inflammation. The 
damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein S100A12 has proven to be a 
sensitive marker for disease activity and inflammation in numerous inflammatory 
disorders. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of S100A12 in the 
detection of inflammation in patients with FMF.
METHODS: 52 children and adolescents with a clinical and/or genetic diagnosis of 
FMF were prospectively followed-up over 18 months (in total 196 visits). During 
clinical visits, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, serum 
amyloid A and S100A12 serum concentrations were determined. Patients were 
categorised into four groups according to the clinical activity of FMF.
RESULTS: Serum concentrations of S100A12 were excessively increased in patients 
with a mean increase of about 290-fold in active FMF above normal controls. 
S100A12 decreased significantly after introduction of colchicine therapy. Serum 
concentrations of S100A12 were significantly higher in patients treated with 
colchicine with persistent symptoms (mean+/-SEM, 6260+/-2120 ng/ml) than in 
those with clinically controlled disease (440+/-80 ng/ml, p<0.001). In contrast 
to classical markers of inflammation, S100A12 was significantly elevated in 
clinically unaffected homozygous MEFV gene mutation carriers, indicating 
subclinical inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: S100A12 is a valuable biomarker for monitoring disease activity, 
inflammation and response to colchicine treatment in patients with FMF. It might 
even be more sensitive in detecting subclinical inflammation than other 
available indicators.
