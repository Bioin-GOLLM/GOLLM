We have studied membrane topology of cytochrome P-450c21 (P450c21) using the 
approaches of mutagenesis and protease digestion. P450c21 is located at the 
cytoplasm with an N-terminal hydrophobic domain integrated into microsomal 
membranes. When this hydrophobic domain was replaced by a secretory signal 
peptide, P450c21 was translocated into the lumen and lost enzymic activity. No 
other topogenic sequence was detected in the bulk of the P450c21 peptide. A 
mutant protein with Pro-30 replaced by Leu (L30) corresponding to the mutation 
found in the diseased state was created. L30 protein lost 90% of enzymic 
activity, while a double mutant (L30R32) with an additional Leu-32 to Arg 
mutation had slightly higher residual enzymic activity. Apart from lower 
activity, L30 was also present in the cell at a lower level than wild-type 
P450c21. This lower level is probably due to increased degradation, as L30 is 
synthesized at a normal rate. Both L30 and L30R32 proteins, however, were 
integrated into membranes normally. Therefore the Pro-30 --> Leu mutation did 
not affect membrane integration, but affected the abundance and enzymic activity 
of P450c21.
