RATIONALE: Oxytocin is a neuropeptide that is associated with increases in 
social affiliative behaviors, particularly toward infants. However, no previous 
study has investigated healthy adults' responses to infant faces following 
oxytocin administration. In addition, given that preliminary evidence suggests 
that a single-nucleotide polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene, 
rs53576, may influence behaviors associated with parental sensitivity, we 
assessed whether such responses vary according to OXTR rs53576 genotype.
OBJECTIVES: The present study assessed the effects of intranasally administered 
oxytocin and OXTR genotype on human adults' preferences for infant faces.
METHODS: A double-blind, between-groups design was used, with 57 genotyped 
volunteers randomly assigned to receive intranasally administered oxytocin or 
placebo. Fifty minutes following the administration of oxytocin or placebo, 
participants viewed infants' and adults' faces showing neutral expressions and 
assessed how appealing they found each face.
RESULTS: Infants' faces were more strongly preferred following oxytocin 
inhalation relative to placebo. When participants were separated according to 
genotype, this effect was only observed for participants homozygous for the 
rs53576G allele. Parallel effects were not seen for adults' faces.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results are consistent with the hypothesis that acute 
oxytocin administration increases sensitivity to reward-relevant features of 
infants and/or reduces sensitivity to their aversive properties. The results are 
also consistent with suggestions of more efficient oxytocinergic function in 
rs53576G homozygotes.
