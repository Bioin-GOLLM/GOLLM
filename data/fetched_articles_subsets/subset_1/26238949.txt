Artificial selection of high yield crops and better livestock is paramount 
importance in breeding programs. Selection of elite parents with preferred 
traits from a phalanx of inbred lines is extremely laborious, time-consuming and 
highly random. General combining ability (GCA) was proposed and has been widely 
used for the evaluation of parents in hybrid breeding for more than half a 
century. However, the genetic and molecular basis of GCA has been largely 
overlooked. Here, we present two pleotropic QTLs are accounting for GCA of days 
to heading (DTH), plant height (PH) and spikelet per panicle (SPP) using an 
F2-based NCII design, the BC3F2 population as well as a set of nearly isogenic 
lines (NILs) with five testers. Both GCA1 and GCA2 were loss-of-function gene in 
low-GCA parent and gain-of-function gene in high-GCA parent, encoding the 
putative Pseudo-Response Regulators, OsPRR37 and Ghd7, respectively. 
Overexpression of GCA1 in low-GCA parent significantly increases GCA effects in 
three traits. Our results demonstrate that two GCA loci associate with OsPRR37 
and Ghd7 and reveal that the genes responsible for important agronomic traits 
could simultaneously account for GCA effects.
