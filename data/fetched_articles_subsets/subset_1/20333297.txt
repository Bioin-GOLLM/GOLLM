The AKT/PKB kinase is a key signaling component of one of the most frequently 
activated pathways in cancer and is a major target of cancer drug development. 
Most studies have focused on its activation by Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) 
mediated Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) activation or loss of 
Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN). We have uncovered that growth factors 
binding to RTKs lead to activation of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Ack1 (also 
known as ACK or TNK2), which directly phosphorylates AKT at an evolutionarily 
conserved tyrosine 176 in the kinase domain. Tyr176-phosphorylated AKT localizes 
to the plasma membrane and promotes Thr308/Ser473-phosphorylation leading to AKT 
activation. Mice expressing activated Ack1 specifically in the prostate exhibit 
AKT Tyr176-phosphorylation and develop murine prostatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia (mPINs). Further, expression levels of Tyr176-phosphorylated-AKT and 
Tyr284-phosphorylated-Ack1 were positively correlated with the severity of 
disease progression, and inversely correlated with the survival of breast cancer 
patients. Thus, RTK/Ack1/AKT pathway provides a novel target for drug discovery.
