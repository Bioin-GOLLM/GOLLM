We present a rather uncommon side effect observed in a 20-year-old man with 
acute promyelocytic leukemia during treatment with ATRA. He developed a high 
platelet counts reaching up to 1655×10⁹/L on day 29 of ATRA treatment, and 
started to recover spontaneously on day 33 of treatment, without any change in 
ATRA, or adding any cytoreduction therapy. No complications associated with 
thrombocytosis were observed. IL-6 seems to play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of the thrombocytosis induced by ATRA. However, it is unclear what 
are the precipitating factors for this rare phenomenon and whether it is caused 
by certain predisposing factors that might be related to patient's, disease 
pathogenesis or other unknown factors.
