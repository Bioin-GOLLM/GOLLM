Sleep is found widely in the animal kingdom. Despite this, few conserved 
molecular pathways that govern sleep across phyla have been described. The 
mammalian brain-type fatty acid binding protein (Fabp7) is expressed in 
astrocytes, and its mRNA oscillates in tandem with the sleep-wake cycle. 
However, the role of FABP7 in regulating sleep remains poorly understood. We 
found that the missense mutation FABP7.T61M is associated with fragmented sleep 
in humans. This phenotype was recapitulated in mice and fruitflies bearing 
similar mutations: Fabp7-deficient mice and transgenic flies that express the 
FABP7.T61M missense mutation in astrocytes also show fragmented sleep. These 
results provide novel evidence for a distinct molecular pathway linking 
lipid-signaling cascades within astrocytes in sleep regulation among 
phylogenetically disparate species.
