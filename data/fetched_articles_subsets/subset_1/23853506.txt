We report the first Italian kindred with Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(FALS) due to c.149T>C mutation in the exon 5 of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) 
gene. The proband was a 49-year-old woman who came to our observation because of 
an history of progressive limbs weakness and gait impairment. She belonged to a 
family of 24 affected members. The prevalent phenotype of the affected members 
was characterized by slowly progressive spinal impairment with proximal 
distribution of weakness, and bulbar involvement in advanced stages. We briefly 
reviewed the few previous reports about the same SOD1 mutation and discussed the 
hypothesis that structural instability of the mutant codon 149 protein may 
underlie some toxic effects significantly involved in FALS pathogenesis.
