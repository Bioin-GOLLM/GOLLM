Biofilm-related infections are a major contributor to human disease, and the 
capacity for surface attachment and biofilm formation are key attributes for the 
pathogenesis of microbes. Serratia marcescens type I fimbriae-dependent biofilms 
are coordinated by the adenylate cyclase, CyaA, and the cyclic 3',5'-adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. This study uses S. 
marcescens as a model system to test the role of cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity 
in controlling biofilm formation. Herein we describe the characterization of a 
putative S. marcescens cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene (SMA3506), designated as 
cpdS, and demonstrated to be a functional cAMP-phosphodiesterase both in vitro 
and in vivo. Deletion of cpdS resulted in defective biofilm formation and 
reduced type I fimbriae production, whereas multicopy expression of cpdS 
conferred a type I fimbriae-dependent hyper-biofilm. Together, these results 
support a model in which bacterial cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity modulates 
biofilm formation.
