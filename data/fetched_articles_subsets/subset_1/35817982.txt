Mapping chromatin loops from noisy Hi-C heatmaps remains a major challenge. Here 
we present DeepLoop, which performs rigorous bias correction followed by 
deep-learning-based signal enhancement for robust chromatin interaction mapping 
from low-depth Hi-C data. DeepLoop enables loop-resolution, single-cell Hi-C 
analysis. It also achieves a cross-platform convergence between different Hi-C 
protocols and micrococcal nuclease (micro-C). DeepLoop allowed us to map the 
genetic and epigenetic determinants of allele-specific chromatin interactions in 
the human genome. We nominate new loci with allele-specific interactions 
governed by imprinting or allelic DNA methylation. We also discovered that, in 
the inactivated X chromosome (Xi), local loops at the DXZ4 'megadomain' boundary 
escape X-inactivation but the FIRRE 'superloop' locus does not. Importantly, 
DeepLoop can pinpoint heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and large 
structure variants that cause allelic chromatin loops, many of which rewire 
enhancers with transcription consequences. Taken together, DeepLoop expands the 
use of Hi-C to provide loop-resolution insights into the genetics of the 
three-dimensional genome.
