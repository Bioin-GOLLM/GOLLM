Many single-transmembrane proteins are sequentially cleaved by 
ectodomain-shedding α-secretases and the γ-secretase complex, a process called 
regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). These cleavages are thought to be 
spatially and temporally separate. In contrast, we provide evidence for a 
hitherto unrecognized multiprotease complex containing both α- and γ-secretase. 
ADAM10 (A10), the principal neuronal α-secretase, interacted and cofractionated 
with γ-secretase endogenously in cells and mouse brain. A10 immunoprecipitation 
yielded γ-secretase proteolytic activity and vice versa. In agreement, 
superresolution microscopy showed that portions of A10 and γ-secretase 
colocalize. Moreover, multiple γ-secretase inhibitors significantly increased 
α-secretase processing (r = -0.86) and decreased β-secretase processing of 
β-amyloid precursor protein. Select members of the tetraspanin web were 
important both in the association between A10 and γ-secretase and the γ → α 
feedback mechanism. Portions of endogenous BACE1 coimmunoprecipitated with 
γ-secretase but not A10, suggesting that β- and α-secretases can form distinct 
complexes with γ-secretase. Thus, cells possess large multiprotease complexes 
capable of sequentially and efficiently processing transmembrane substrates 
through a spatially coordinated RIP mechanism.
