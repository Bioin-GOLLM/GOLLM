The aim of the study was to determine associations of factor VII:C levels in 140 
South Asian stroke subjects and 143 first-degree relatives versus age-sex 
matched 146 control subjects without a personal or a family history of stroke 
subjects living in UK. There were no significant differences in Factor VII:C 
levels or FVII Msp I gene polymorphism (Arg-Gln 353) R353Q genotype frequency 
between the groups. R353Q genotype determined Factor VII:C levels in all the 
three groups. Factor VII:C levels correlated with triglycerides (patients, r = 
0.23; relatives r = 27; control subjects, r = 0.24) and plasminogen activator 
inhibitor activity (patients, r = 0.30; relatives r = 0.22; control subjects r = 
0.20) in all the three groups, but with insulin only in patients (p = 0.19). 
Circulating levels of Factor VII:C are determined by R353Q genotype and cluster 
with other risk factors associated with insulin resistance in South Asian 
ischaemic stroke patients, first-degree relatives and control subjects but are 
not related to stroke or a family history of stroke.
