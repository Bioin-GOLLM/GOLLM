The unique properties of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) to self-renew and 
their multipotentiality have rendered them attractive to researchers and 
clinicians. In addition to the differentiation potential, the broad repertoire 
of secreted trophic factors (cytokines) exhibiting diverse functions such as 
immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory activity, angiogenesis and anti-apoptotic, 
commonly referred to as the MSC secretome, has gained immense attention in the 
past few years. There is enough evidence to show that the one important pathway 
by which MSCs participate in tissue repair and regeneration is through its 
secretome. Concurrently, a large body of MSC research has focused on 
characterization of the MSC secretome; this includes both soluble factors and 
factors released in extracellular vesicles, for example, exosomes and 
microvesicles. This review provides an overview of our current understanding of 
the MSC secretome with respect to their potential clinical applications.
