Intracranial immature teratoma is an extremely rare disease with poor prognosis 
and requires complicated treatment. Owing to the deep midline location of the 
tumor, total surgical resection of the tumor is challenging. We present our 
experience with a fast-growing pineal gland immature teratoma in a 4-year-old 
boy, who presented with obstructive hydrocephalus and abducens nerve palsy, 
which was treated with total surgical resection of the tumor. In addition, we 
aimed to determine the appropriate treatment modality for intracranial immature 
teratomas by reviewing the literature and investigating the prognosis.
