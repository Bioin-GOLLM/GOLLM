Bile acid: sodium symporter family protein 2 (BASS2) is a sodium-dependent 
pyruvate transporter, which transports pyruvate from cytosol into plastid in 
plants. In this study, we investigated the function of chloroplast envelope 
membrane-localized BnaBASS2 in seed metabolism and seed oil accumulation of 
Brassica napus (B. napus). Four BASS2 genes were identified in the genome of B. 
napus. BnaA05.BASS2 was overexpressed while BnaA05.BASS2 and BnaC04.BASS2-1 were 
mutated by CRISPR in B. napus. Metabolite analysis revealed that the 
manipulation of BnaBASS2 caused significant changes in glycolysis-, fatty acid 
synthesis-, and energy-related metabolites in the chloroplasts of 
31 day-after-flowering (DAF) seeds. The analysis of fatty acids and lipids in 
developing seeds showed that BnaBASS2 could affect lipid metabolism and oil 
accumulation in developing seeds. Moreover, the overexpression (OE) of 
BnaA05.BASS2 could promote the expression level of multiple genes involved in 
the synthesis of oil and the formation of oil body during seed development. 
Disruption of BnaA05.BASS2 and BnaC04.BASS2-1 resulted in decreasing the seed 
oil content (SOC) by 2.8%-5.0%, while OE of BnaA05.BASS2 significantly promoted 
the SOC by 1.4%-3.4%. Together, our results suggest that BnaBASS2 is a potential 
target gene for breeding B. napus with high SOC.
