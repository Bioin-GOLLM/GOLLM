BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of 
rotating night shift work, CLOCK, MTNR1A, MTNR1B genes polymorphisms and their 
interactions with type 2 diabetes among steelworkers.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in the Tangsteel company in 
Tangshan, China. The sample sizes of the case group and control group were 251 
and 451, respectively. The logistic regression, log-linear model and generalized 
multifactor dimensionality (GMDR) method were used to investigate the 
interaction between circadian clock gene, melatonin receptor genes and rotating 
night shift work on type 2 diabetes among steelworkers. Relative excess risk due 
to interaction (RERI) and attributable proportions (AP) were used to evaluate 
additive interactions.
RESULTS: Rotating night shift work, current shift status, duration of night 
shifts, and average frequency of night shifts were associated with an increased 
risk of type 2 diabetes after adjustment for confounders. Rs1387153 variants in 
MTNR1B was found to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, 
which was not found between MTNR1A gene rs2119882 locus, CLOCK gene rs1801260 
locus and the risk of type 2 diabetes. The association between rotating night 
shift work and risk of type 2 diabetes appeared to be modified by MTNR1B gene 
rs1387153 locus (RERI = 0.98, (95% CI, 0.40-1.55); AP = 0.60, (95% CI, 
0.07-1.12)). The interaction between MTNR1A gene rs2119882 locus and CLOCK gene 
rs1801260 locus was associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (RERI = 1.07, 
(95% CI, 0.23-1.91); AP = 0.77, (95% CI, 0.36-1.17)). The complex interaction of 
the MTNR1A-MTNR1B-CLOCK-rotating night shift work model based on the GMDR 
methods may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: Rotating night shift work and rs1387153 variants in MTNR1B were 
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes among steelworkers. The 
complex interaction of MTNR1A-MTNR1B-CLOCK-rotating night shift work may 
increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
