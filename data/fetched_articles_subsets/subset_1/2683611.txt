Studies of cytotoxicity by human lymphocytes revealed not only that both 
allogeneic and syngeneic tumor cells were lysed in a non-MHC-restricted fashion, 
but also that lymphocytes from normal donors were often cytotoxic. Lymphocytes 
from any healthy donor, as well as peripheral blood and spleen lymphocytes from 
several experimental animals, in the absence of known or deliberate 
sensitization, were found to be spontaneously cytotoxic in vitro for some normal 
fresh cells, most cultured cell lines, immature hematopoietic cells, and tumor 
cells. This type of nonadaptive, non-MHC-restricted cellmediated cytotoxicity 
was defined as “natural” cytotoxicity, and the effector cells mediating natural 
cytotoxicity were functionally defined as natural killer (NK) cells. The 
existence of NK cells has prompted a reinterpretation of both the studies of 
specific cytotoxicity against spontaneous human tumors and the theory of immune 
surveillance, at least in its most restrictive interpretation. Unlike cytotoxic 
T cells, NK cells cannot be demonstrated to have clonally distributed 
specificity, restriction for MHC products at the target cell surface, or 
immunological memory. NK cells cannot yet be formally assigned to a single 
lineage based on the definitive identification of a stem cell, a distinct 
anatomical location of maturation, or unique genotypic rearrangements.
