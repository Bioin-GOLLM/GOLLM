Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic, inflammatory skin 
disorders with a complex etiology and a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. 
Despite its high prevalence and effect on the quality of life, safe and 
effective systemic therapies approved for long-term management of AD are 
limited. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis in 
recent years has contributed to the development of new therapeutic approaches 
that target specific pathophysiological pathways. Skin barrier dysfunction and 
immunological abnormalities are critical in the pathogenesis of AD. Recently, 
the importance of the downregulation of epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) 
molecules caused by external and internal stimuli has been extensively 
emphasized. The purpose of this review is to discuss the innovations in the 
therapy of atopic dermatitis, including biologics, small molecule therapies, and 
other drugs by highlighting regulatory mechanisms of skin barrier-related 
molecules, such as filaggrin (FLG) as a crucial pathway implicated in AD 
pathogenesis.
