In humans, four small HERCs (HERC3-6) exhibit differential degrees of antiviral 
activity toward HIV-1. Recently we revealed a novel member HERC7 of small HERCs 
exclusively in non-mammalian vertebrates and varied copies of herc7 genes in 
distinct fish species, raising a question of what is the exact role for a 
certain fish herc7 gene. Here, a total of four herc7 genes (named HERC7a-d 
sequentially) are identified in the zebrafish genome. They are transcriptionally 
induced by a viral infection, and detailed promoter analyses indicate that 
zebrafish herc7c is a typical interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene. Overexpression 
of zebrafish HERC7c promotes SVCV (spring viremia of carp virus) replication in 
fish cells and concomitantly downregulates cellular IFN response. 
Mechanistically, zebrafish HERC7c targets STING, MAVS, and IRF7 for protein 
degradation, thus impairing cellular IFN response. Whereas the 
recently-identified crucian carp HERC7 has an E3 ligase activity for the 
conjugation of both ubiquitin and ISG15, zebrafish HERC7c only displays the 
potential to transfer ubiquitin. Considering the necessity for timely regulation 
of IFN expression during viral infection, these results together suggest that 
zebrafish HERC7c is a negative regulator of fish IFN antiviral response.
