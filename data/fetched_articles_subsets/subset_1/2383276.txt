We report the molecular characterization of a Japanese Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD) patient. The analysis of genomic gene by polymerase chain 
reaction indicates that the individuals have a limited deletion within an 
amplified region, which encompasses exon 19 of DMD gene. The amplified region 
was sequenced. Comparison of the deletion joint sequence with the normal 
amplified region sequence indicates that both 5' and 3' deletion end points are 
present within exon 19 and the deletion removes total 52 bp out of 88 bp of exon 
19. Both his mother and sister are carriers of the deletion-containing allele. 
The mutation introduces a termination codon at residue 791 in exon 20, and is 
predicted to result in the production of a severely truncated protein. This sort 
of deletion (designated as DMD-Kobe) might be classified as a new type of DMD 
gene abnormality.
