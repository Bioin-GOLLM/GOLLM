INTRODUCTION: Apert syndrome is a rare syndrome characterized by a consistent 
phenotype including bilateral coronal suture synostosis with an enlarged 
anterior fontanel, midface hypoplasia, and complex symmetric syndactyly of hands 
and feet.
CASE REPORT: We present a boy with Apert syndrome caused by the pathogenic 
c.755C > G p.Ser252Trp mutation in the FGFR2 gene with atypical characteristics, 
including premature fusion of the metopic suture with a small anterior fontanel, 
hypotelorism, and a massive posterior fontanel. Directly after birth, he showed 
papilledema, epilepsy, and central apneas.
CONCLUSION: We present a newborn with Apert syndrome with atypical craniofacial 
presentation.
