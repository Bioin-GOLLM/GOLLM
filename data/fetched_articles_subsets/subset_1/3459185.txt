Antigenic competition at the level of peptide-Ia binding.

Babbitt BP, Matsueda G, Haber E, Unanue ER, Allen PM.

We examined the direct binding of a hen egg white lysozyme peptide, HEL(46-61), 
to membrane I-Ak (protein encoded in the A locus of the I region) molecules in 
the presence of detergent. A number of synthetic peptide derivatives, which did 
not stimulate our T-cell reactive hybridomas, competed for the binding of 
HEL(46-61) to I-Ak and also inhibited the functional presentation of HEL(46-61). 
Inhibitors included a peptide lacking a tyrosine at position 53 and a peptide 
corresponding to the autologous lysozyme peptide. Presentation was examined with 
cells or with supported planar phospholipid membranes bearing only I-Ak and 
HEL(46-61). Other peptides that did not compete for the binding did not inhibit 
functional presentation. We concluded that the binding of an immunogenic peptide 
to I-A is critical for presentation, that the I-A molecule does not discriminate 
between autologous and foreign related determinants but does recognize 
structurally different peptides. Our evidence suggests that our immunogenic 
peptide bears noncontiguous amino acids critical for contact I-A binding 
interspersed with amino acids critical for interaction with T cells.
