Cerebral edema resulting in elevated intracranial pressure is a well-known 
complication of galactosemia. Lumbar puncture was performed for the diagnosis of 
clinically suspected bacterial meningitis. Herniation of cerebral tissue through 
the foramen magnum is not a common problem in neonatal intensive care units 
because of the open fontanelle in infants. We present the case of a 3-week-old 
infant with galactosemia who presented with signs of cerebellar herniation after 
lumbar puncture.
