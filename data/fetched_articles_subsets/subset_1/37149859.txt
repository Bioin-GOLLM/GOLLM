Lower-grade gliomas exhibit a high prevalence of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 
(IDH1) mutations, but faithful models for studying these tumors are lacking. 
Here, we present a protocol to establish a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) 
model of grade 3 astrocytoma driven by the Idh1R132H oncogene. We describe steps 
for breeding compound transgenic mice and intracranially delivering 
adeno-associated virus particles, followed by post-surgical surveillance via 
magnetic resonance imaging. This protocol enables the generation and use of a 
GEM to study lower-grade IDH-mutant gliomas. For complete details on the use and 
execution of this protocol, please refer to Shi et al. (2022).1.
