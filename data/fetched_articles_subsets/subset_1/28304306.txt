BACKGROUND: The rate of cognitive and functional decline in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) changes across individuals.
OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to assess whether the concept of "fast decline" 
really fits its definition and whether cognitive and functional variables at 
onset can predict the progression of AD.
METHODS: 324 AD patients were included. We retrospectively examined their 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score and sub-items, Activities of 
Daily Living (ADL), and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) at 
baseline and every six months for a 4-year follow-up. Patients were divided into 
"fast decliners" (n = 62), defined by a loss ≥5 points on the MMSE score within 
the first year from the baseline; "intermediate decliners" (n = 37), by a loss 
≥5 points after the first year and before the 18th month; or "slow decliners" 
(n = 225), composed of the remaining patients.
RESULTS: At baseline, the groups did not differ on demographic, clinical, and 
cognitive variables. The decline at the end of the 4-year follow-up period seems 
to be similar among the different decline clusters. Predictors of disease 
progression have not been identified; only the MMSE total score at 12 months 
<14/30 was indicative of a poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Even with the limitation due to the small sample size, the lack of 
differences in the disease progression in time in the different clusters suggest 
the inconsistency of the so-called "fast decliners". This study was unable to 
show any significant difference among clusters of AD progression within a 4-year 
time interval. Further studies should better clarify whether a more consistent 
distinction exists between slow and fast decliners.
