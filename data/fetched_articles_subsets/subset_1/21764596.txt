A large number of studies have shown that the -1082A/G polymorphism (rs1800896) 
in the Interleukin-10 gene (IL-10) is implicated in the susceptibility to 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the results are inconsistent and 
inconclusive. The aim of this study is to analyze the association between the 
-1082A/G polymorphism in the IL-10 gene and the RA risk by meta-analysis. A 
total of 1480 cases and 1413 controls in 10 case-control studies were included 
in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that the G allele carriers (GG+GA) 
had a 25% decreased risk of RA, when compared with the homozygote AA (odds ratio 
(OR)=0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.59-0.93). In the analysis in 
Europeans, significant decreased risks were associated with the G allele 
carriers (OR=0.73 and 95% CI: 0.57-0.93 for GG+GA vs. AA). The results from this 
meta-analysis provide evidence for the association between the IL-10 -1082A/G 
polymorphism and the risk of RA. To further evaluate gene×gene and 
gene×environment interactions between the polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene and RA 
risk, more studies with large groups of patients are required.
