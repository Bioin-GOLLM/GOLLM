Retinal vasculature changes in diabetic patients are most common cause of 
blindness among eye diseases. Numerous studies have explored the role of the 
agiogenic factors in the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The balance 
between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors has a determining role in the DR 
progression. Current treatment modalities include laser photocoagulation, 
intravitreal drug application, and pars plana vitrectomy (ppv). These maneuvers 
are employed with occurrence of advanced retinal changes. New diagnostic 
approaches can provide better information for the initial retinal changes 
thereby requiring a new DR classification and treatment guidelines. The results 
that are expected from Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR) are 
at the level where prediction and prevention can not be made. Innovative 
molecular-imaging technology, can pave the way for application of novel clinical 
approaches. Identification of pathology-specific biomarkers and their 
application to diagnosis and treatment, support the individualized treatment 
algorithms.
