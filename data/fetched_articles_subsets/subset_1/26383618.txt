BACKGROUND: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of 
counteracting inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins using the small molecule 
Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspase (SMAC) mimetic BV6 in 
combination with ionizing radiation on apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, DNA 
double-strand break (DSB) repair, three-dimensional (3D) clonogenic survival and 
expression of IAPs in colorectal carcinoma cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-15, HT-29, SW480) were 
subjected to BV6 treatment (0-4 μM) with or without irradiation (2-8 Gy, single 
dose) followed by MTT, Caspase 3/7 activity, γH2AX/53BP1 foci assays, AnnexinV 
staining, cell cycle analysis, 3D colony forming assays and Western blotting 
(cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, Survivin, X-linked IAP (XIAP)).
RESULTS: BV6 treatment decreased cell viability and significantly increased 
irradiation-induced apoptosis as analyzed by Caspase 3/7 activity, 
AnnexinV-positive and subG1 phase cells. While basal 3D clonogenic survival was 
decreased in a cell line-dependent manner, BV6 significantly enhanced cellular 
radiosensitivity of all cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner and 
increased the number of radiation-induced γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci. Western 
blot analysis revealed a markedly reduced cIAP1 expression at 4 h after BV6 
treatment in all cell lines, a substantial reduction of XIAP expression in SW480 
and HT-29 cells at 24 h and a slightly decreased cIAP2 expression in HCT-15 
cells at 48 h after treatment. Moreover, single or double knockdown of cIAP1 and 
XIAP resulted in significantly increased residual γH2AX/53BP1-positive foci 24 h 
after 2 Gy and radiosensitization relative to control small interfering RNA 
(siRNA)-treated cells.
CONCLUSION: The SMAC mimetic BV6 induced apoptosis and hampered DNA damage 
repair to radiosensitize 3D grown colorectal cancer cells. Our results 
demonstrate IAP targeting as a promising strategy to counteract radiation 
resistance of colorectal cancer cells.
