The Qiang ethnic group is one of the oldest ethnic groups in China and is the 
most active ethnic group among all the populations along the Tibetan-Yi 
corridor. They have had a profound impact nationally and internationally. The 
paternal and maternal genetic feature of the Qiang ethnic group has been 
revealed, leaving the question of the genetic characteristics from autosomes and 
X chromosome not answered. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of 
36 A-STR (Microreader™ 36A ID System) and 19 X-STR (Microreader™ 19X System) for 
application in the Qiang population and to elucidate their genetic diversity in 
southwest China. The cumulative probability of exclusion (CPE) for autosomal 
STRs is 1-1.3814 × 10-15 and the mean paternity exclusion chance (MEC) for 
X-STRs is 1-1.7323 × 10-6. Forensic parameters suggest that the STRs analyzed 
here are well-suited for forensic applications. The results of phylogenetic, 
interpopulation differentiation, and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) 
indicate that the Qiang people have extensive connections with ethnic minorities 
in China, supporting the view that the Qiang people are the oldest group in the 
entire Sino-Tibetan language family. The Qiang appeared genetically more 
associated with most ethnic groups in China, especially the Han. The calculation 
of random matching probability (RMP) was improved by Fst correction of allele 
frequencies to make RMP more accurate and reasonable. This study can fill in the 
gaps in the Qiang STR reference database, providing valuable frequency data for 
forensic applications and evidence for the Qiang's genetic pattern as an 
important ancestral position in the Sino-Tibetan populations.
