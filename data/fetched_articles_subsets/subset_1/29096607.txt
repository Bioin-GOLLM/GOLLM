BACKGROUND: Defects in the human glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 
biosynthetic pathway are associated with inherited glycosylphosphatidylinositol 
(GPI)-deficiencies characterized by a broad range of clinical phenotypes 
including multiple congenital anomalies, dysmorphic faces, developmental delay, 
hypotonia, and epilepsy. Biallelic variants in PIGN, encoding 
phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class N have been recently associated 
with multiple congenital anomalies hypotonia seizure syndrome.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is a 2 year old male with hypotonia, global 
developmental delay, and focal epilepsy. Trio whole-exome sequencing revealed 
heterozygous variants in PIGN, c.181G > T (p.Glu61*) and c.284G > A 
(p.Arg95Gln). Analysis of FLAER and anti-CD59 by flow-cytometry demonstrated a 
shift in this patient's granulocytes, confirming a 
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-biosynthesis defect, consistent with PIGN-related 
disease.
CONCLUSIONS: To date, a total of 18 patients have been reported, all but 2 of 
whom have congenital anomalies and/or obvious dysmorphic features. Our patient 
has no significant dysmorphic features or multiple congenital anomalies, which 
is consistent with recent reports linking non-truncating variants with a milder 
phenotype, highlighting the importance of functional studies in interpreting 
sequence variants.
