BACKGROUND: Cleavage of aggrecan by ADAMTS proteinases at specific sites within 
highly conserved regions may be important to normal physiological enzyme 
functions, as well as pathological degradation.
METHODS: To examine ADAMTS selectivity, we assayed ADAMTS-4 and -5 cleavage of 
recombinant bovine aggrecan mutated at amino acids N-terminal or C-terminal to 
the interglobular domain cleavage site.
RESULTS: Mutations of conserved amino acids from P18 to P12 to increase 
hydrophilicity resulted in ADAMTS-4 cleavage inhibition. Mutation of Thr, but 
not Asn within the conserved N-glycosylation motif Asn-Ile-Thr from P6 to P4 
enhanced cleavage. Mutation of conserved Thr residues from P22 to P17 to 
increase hydrophobicity enhanced ADAMTS-4 cleavage. A P4' Ser377Gln mutant 
inhibited cleavage by ADAMTS-4 and -5, while a neutral Ser377Ala mutant and 
species mimicking mutants Ser377Thr, Ser377Asn, and Arg375Leu were cleaved 
normally by ADAMTS-4. The Ser377Thr mutant, however, was resistant to cleavage 
by ADAMTS-5.
CONCLUSION: We have identified multiple conserved amino acids within regions N- 
and C-terminal to the site of scission that may influence enzyme-substrate 
recognition, and may interact with exosites on ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of the binding of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 
exosites to aggrecan should be explored as a therapeutic intervention for 
osteoarthritis.
