The T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway is an ensemble of numerous proteins 
that are crucial for an adequate immune response. Disruption of any protein 
involved in this pathway leads to severe immunodeficiency and unfavorable 
clinical outcomes. Here, we describe an infant with severe immunodeficiency who 
was found to have novel biallelic mutations in SLP76. SLP76 is a key protein 
involved in TCR signaling and in other hematopoietic pathways. Previous studies 
of this protein were performed using Jurkat-derived human leukemic T cell lines 
and SLP76-deficient mice. Our current study links this gene, for the first time, 
to a human immunodeficiency characterized by early-onset life-threatening 
infections, combined T and B cell immunodeficiency, severe neutrophil defects, 
and impaired platelet aggregation. Hereby, we characterized aspects of the 
patient's immune phenotype, modeled them with an SLP76-deficient Jurkat-derived 
T cell line, and rescued some consequences using ectopic expression of wild-type 
SLP76. Understanding human diseases due to SLP76 deficiency is helpful in 
explaining the mixed T cell and neutrophil defects, providing a guide for 
exploring human SLP76 biology.
