Currently, no effective therapeutics exist for the treatment of incurable 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cellular prion 
protein (PrPC) acts as a high-affinity receptor for amyloid beta oligomers 
(AβO), a main neurotoxic species mediating AD pathology. The interaction of AβO 
with PrPC subsequently activates Fyn tyrosine kinase and neuroinflammation. 
Herein, we used our previously developed peptide aptamer 8 (PA8) binding to PrPC 
as a therapeutic to target the AβO-PrP-Fyn axis and prevent its associated 
pathologies. Our in vitro results indicated that PA8 prevents the binding of AβO 
with PrPC and reduces AβO-induced neurotoxicity in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells 
and primary hippocampal neurons. Next, we performed in vivo experiments using 
the transgenic 5XFAD mouse model of AD. The 5XFAD mice were treated with PA8 and 
its scaffold protein thioredoxin A (Trx) at a 14.4 µg/day dosage for 12 weeks by 
intraventricular infusion through Alzet® osmotic pumps. We observed that 
treatment with PA8 improves learning and memory functions of 5XFAD mice as 
compared to Trx-treated 5XFAD mice. We found that PA8 treatment significantly 
reduces AβO levels and Aβ plaques in the brain tissue of 5XFAD mice. 
Interestingly, PA8 significantly reduces AβO-PrP interaction and its downstream 
signaling such as phosphorylation of Fyn kinase, reactive gliosis as well as 
apoptotic neurodegeneration in the 5XFAD mice compared to Trx-treated 5XFAD 
mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that treatment with PA8 targeting 
the AβO-PrP-Fyn axis is a promising and novel approach to prevent and treat AD.
