OBJECTIVES: Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is a rare disorder caused 
by compound heterozygosity or homozygosity for > 300 mutations in the PKLR gene. 
To understand PK deficiency prevalence, we conducted a systematic literature 
review.
METHODS: We queried Embase and Medline for peer-reviewed references reporting PK 
deficiency prevalence/incidence, PKLR mutant allele frequency (MAF) among the 
general population, or crude results from which these metrics could be derived.
RESULTS: Of 1390 references screened, 1296 were excluded after title/abstract 
review; 60 were excluded after full-text review. Four of the remaining 34 
studies were considered high-quality for estimating PK deficiency prevalence. 
Two high-quality studies identified cases from source populations of known 
sizes, producing estimates of diagnosed PK deficiency prevalence of 3.2 and 8.5 
per million. Another high-quality study derived an estimate of diagnosed PK 
deficiency prevalence of 6.5 per million by screening jaundiced newborns. The 
final high-quality study estimated total diagnosed and undiagnosed PK deficiency 
prevalence to be 51 per million through extrapolation from observed MAFs.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that prevalence of clinically diagnosed PK deficiency 
is likely between 3.2 and 8.5 per million in Western populations, while the 
prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed PK deficiency could possibly be as high 
as 51 per million.
