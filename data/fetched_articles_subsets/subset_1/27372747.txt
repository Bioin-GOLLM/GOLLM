Chromatin accessibility is modulated by structural transitions that provide 
timely access to the genetic and epigenetic information during many essential 
nuclear processes. These transitions are orchestrated by regulatory proteins 
that coordinate intricate structural modifications and signaling pathways. In 
vitro reconstituted chromatin samples from defined components are instrumental 
in defining the mechanistic details of such processes. The bottleneck to 
appropriate in vitro analysis is the production of high quality, and 
quality-controlled, chromatin substrates. In this chapter, we describe methods 
for in vitro chromatin reconstitution and quality control. We highlight the 
strengths and weaknesses of various approaches and emphasize quality control 
steps that ensure reconstitution of a bona fide homogenous chromatin 
preparation. This is essential for optimal reproducibility and reliability of 
ensuing experiments using chromatin substrates.
