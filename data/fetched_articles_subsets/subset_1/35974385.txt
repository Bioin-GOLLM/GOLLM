Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by 
pathogenic TP53 variants. The condition represents one of the most relevant 
genetic causes of cancer in children and adults due to its frequency and high 
cancer risk. The term Li-Fraumeni spectrum reflects the evolving phenotypic 
variability of the condition. Within this spectrum, patients who meet specific 
LFS criteria are diagnosed with LFS, while patients who do not meet these 
criteria are diagnosed with attenuated LFS. To explore genotype-phenotype 
correlations we analyzed 141 individuals from 94 families with pathogenic TP53 
variants registered in the German Cancer Predisposition Syndrome Registry. 
Twenty-one (22%) families had attenuated LFS and 73 (78%) families met the 
criteria of LFS. NULL variants occurred in 32 (44%) families with LFS and in two 
(9.5%) families with attenuated LFS (P value < 0.01). Kato partially functional 
variants were present in 10 out of 53 (19%) families without childhood cancer 
except adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) versus 0 out of 41 families with childhood 
cancer other than ACC alone (P value < 0.01). Our study suggests 
genotype-phenotype correlations encouraging further analyses.
