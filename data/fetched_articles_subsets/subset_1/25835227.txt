Ketoreductases (KRs) from modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) can perform 
stereospecific catalysis, selecting a polyketide with a D- or L-α-methyl 
substituent for NADPH-mediated reduction. In this report, molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations were performed to investigate the interactions that control 
stereospecificity. We studied the A1-type KR from the second module of the 
amphotericin PKS (A1), which is known to be stereospecific for a 
D-α-methyl-substituted diketide substrate (dkD). MD simulations of two ternary 
complexes comprised of the enzyme, NADPH, and either the correct substrate, dkD, 
or its enantiomer (dkL) were performed. The coordinates for the A1/NADPH binary 
complex were obtained from a crystal structure (PDB entry 3MJS), and substrates 
were modeled in the binding pocket in conformations appropriate for reduction. 
Simulations were intended to reproduce the initial weak binding of the 
polyketide substrate to the enzyme. Long (tens of nanoseconds) MD simulations 
show that the correct substrate is retained in a conformation closer to the 
reactive configuration. Many short (up to a nanosecond) MD runs starting from 
the initial structures display evidence that Q364, three residues N-terminal to 
the catalytic tyrosine, forms a hydrogen bond to the incorrect dkL substrate to 
yield an unreactive conformation that is more favorable than the reactive 
configuration. This interaction is not as strong for dkD, as the D-α-methyl 
substituent is positioned between the glutamine and the reactive site. This 
result correlates with experimental findings [Zheng, J., et al. (2010) Structure 
18, 913-922] in which a Q364H mutant was observed to lose stereospecificity.
