Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with a 
dramatically increasing prevalence and no disease-modifying treatment. 
Inflammatory lifestyle factors increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's 
disease. Zinc deficiency is the most prevalent malnutrition in the world and may 
be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease potentially through enhanced 
inflammation, although evidence for this is limited. Here we provide 
epidemiological evidence suggesting that zinc supplementation was associated 
with reduced risk and slower cognitive decline, in people with Alzheimer's 
disease and mild cognitive impairment. Using the APP/PS1 mouse model of 
Alzheimer's disease fed a control (35 mg/kg zinc) or diet deficient in zinc (3 
mg/kg zinc), we determined that zinc deficiency accelerated Alzheimer's-like 
memory deficits without modifying amyloid β plaque burden in the brains of male 
mice. The NLRP3-inflammasome complex is one of the most important regulators of 
inflammation, and we show here that zinc deficiency in immune cells, including 
microglia, potentiated NLRP3 responses to inflammatory stimuli in vitro, 
including amyloid oligomers, while zinc supplementation inhibited NLRP3 
activation. APP/PS1 mice deficient in NLRP3 were protected against the 
accelerated cognitive decline with zinc deficiency. Collectively, this research 
suggests that zinc status is linked to inflammatory reactivity and may be 
modified in people to reduce the risk and slow the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease is a common condition mostly 
affecting the elderly. Zinc deficiency is also a global problem, especially in 
the elderly and also in people with Alzheimer's disease. Zinc deficiency 
contributes to many clinical disorders, including immune dysfunction. 
Inflammation is known to contribute to the risk and progression of Alzheimer's 
disease; thus, we hypothesized that zinc status would affect Alzheimer's disease 
progression. Here we show that zinc supplementation reduced the prevalence and 
symptomatic decline in people with Alzheimer's disease. In an animal model of 
Alzheimer's disease, zinc deficiency worsened cognitive decline because of an 
enhancement in NLRP3-driven inflammation. Overall, our data suggest that zinc 
status affects Alzheimer's disease progression, and that zinc supplementation 
could slow the rate of cognitive decline.
