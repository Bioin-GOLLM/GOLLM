In the title compound, [Cd(C(12)H(16)NO(4)S)(2)(H(2)O)]·2H(2)O, the Cd atom is 
located on a twofold rotation axis and a distorted CdO(8) dodeca-hedral 
arrangement arises from the coordination of the two chelating ligands and four 
water mol-ecules. A network of N-H⋯O, O-H⋯O and C-H⋯O hydrogen bonds help to 
establish the crystal packing. Both coordinated and uncoordinated water 
molecules are disordered with an approximate half-occupation for each of the 
water molecules.
