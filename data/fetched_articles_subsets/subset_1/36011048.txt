Brain tumor characterization (BTC) is the process of knowing the underlying 
cause of brain tumors and their characteristics through various approaches such 
as tumor segmentation, classification, detection, and risk analysis. The 
substantial brain tumor characterization includes the identification of the 
molecular signature of various useful genomes whose alteration causes the brain 
tumor. The radiomics approach uses the radiological image for disease 
characterization by extracting quantitative radiomics features in the artificial 
intelligence (AI) environment. However, when considering a higher level of 
disease characteristics such as genetic information and mutation status, the 
combined study of "radiomics and genomics" has been considered under the 
umbrella of "radiogenomics". Furthermore, AI in a radiogenomics' environment 
offers benefits/advantages such as the finalized outcome of personalized 
treatment and individualized medicine. The proposed study summarizes the brain 
tumor's characterization in the prospect of an emerging field of research, i.e., 
radiomics and radiogenomics in an AI environment, with the help of statistical 
observation and risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis. The PRISMA search approach was used 
to find 121 relevant studies for the proposed review using IEEE, Google Scholar, 
PubMed, MDPI, and Scopus. Our findings indicate that both radiomics and 
radiogenomics have been successfully applied aggressively to several oncology 
applications with numerous advantages. Furthermore, under the AI paradigm, both 
the conventional and deep radiomics features have made an impact on the 
favorable outcomes of the radiogenomics approach of BTC. Furthermore, 
risk-of-bias (RoB) analysis offers a better understanding of the architectures 
with stronger benefits of AI by providing the bias involved in them.
