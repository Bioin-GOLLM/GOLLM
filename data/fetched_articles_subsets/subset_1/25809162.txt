Tight junctions (TJ) and adherens junctions (AJ) are key morphological features 
of differentiated epithelial cells that regulate the integrity and permeability 
of tissue barriers. Structure and remodeling of epithelial junctions depends on 
their association with the underlying actomyosin cytoskeleton. Anillin is a 
unique scaffolding protein interacting with different cytoskeletal components, 
including actin filaments and myosin motors. Its role in the regulation of 
mammalian epithelial junctions remains unexplored. Downregulation of anillin 
expression in human prostate, colonic, and lung epithelial cells triggered AJ 
and TJ disassembly without altering the expression of junctional proteins. This 
junctional disassembly was accompanied by dramatic disorganization of the 
perijunctional actomyosin belt; while the general architecture of the actin 
cytoskeleton, and activation status of non-muscle myosin II, remained unchanged. 
Furthermore, loss of anillin disrupted the adducin-spectrin membrane skeleton at 
the areas of cell-cell contact, selectively decreased γ-adducin expression, and 
induced cytoplasmic aggregation of αII-spectrin. Anillin knockdown activated 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and JNK inhibition restored AJ and TJ integrity 
and cytoskeletal organization in anillin-depleted cells. These findings suggest 
a novel role for anillin in regulating intercellular adhesion in model human 
epithelia by mechanisms involving the suppression of JNK activity and 
controlling the assembly of the perijunctional cytoskeleton.
