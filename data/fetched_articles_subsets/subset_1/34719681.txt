TET3 at 2p13.1 encodes tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3, a demethylation enzyme 
that converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Beck et al. reported 
that patients with TET3 abnormalities in either an autosomal dominant or 
recessive inheritance fashion clinically showed global developmental delay, 
intellectual disability, and dysmorphisms. In this study, exome sequencing 
identified both mono- and biallelic TET3 variants in two families: a de novo 
variant NM_001287491.1:c.3028 A > G:p.(Asn1010Asp), and compound heterozygous 
variants NM_001287491.1:c.[2077 C > T];[2896 T > G],p.[Gln693*];[Cys966Gly]. 
Despite the different inheritance modes, the affected individuals showed similar 
phenotypic features. Including these three patients, only 14 affected 
individuals have been reported to date. The accumulation of data regarding 
individuals with TET3-related disorder is necessary to describe their clinical 
spectrum.
