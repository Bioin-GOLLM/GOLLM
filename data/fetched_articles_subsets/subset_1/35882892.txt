Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane protein that plays critical 
role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is also involved in 
many types of cancers. Increasing evidence has shown that the tyrosine 
phosphorylation site Y682 in the intracellular tail of APP is crucial for APP 
function. Here, we report that Vav2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) 
for Rho family GTPase, is a novel interaction partner of APP. We found that 
Vav2-SH2 domain was able to bind directly to the Y682-phosphorylated 
intracellular tail of APP through isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR 
titrating experiments. The crystal structure of Vav2-SH2 in complex with an 
APP-derived phosphopeptide was determined to understand the structural basis of 
this recognition specificity. The interaction of APP and Vav2 in a full-length 
manner was further confirmed in cells by GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation 
and immunofluorescence staining experiments. In addition, we found 
overexpression of Vav2 could inhibit APP degradation and markedly increase the 
protein levels of APP and its cleavage productions in 20E2 cells, and this 
function of Vav2 required a functional SH2 domain.
