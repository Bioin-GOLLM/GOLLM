The WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway upregulates transcription of genes involved 
in cell proliferation and cancer progression; it has been implicated in 
colorectal adenoma formation. To date, no studies have examined polymorphisms in 
WNT genes or WNT gene-environment interactions in relation to adenoma risk. 
Within a colonoscopy-based case-control study of 628 adenoma cases and 516 
polyp-free controls, we analyzed two tagSNPs in WNT6 (rs6747776 G > C, rs6754599 
G > C) and WNT10A (rs7349332 G > A, rs10177996 A > G). The WNT6 rs6747776 
homozygous minor allele (CC) was associated with increased risk of colorectal 
adenoma (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.03-7.31). We observed a statistically significant 
interaction between WNT6 rs6747776 and the proportion of calories from total fat 
(P-int = 0.02), where the highest risk was observed among those with minor 
alleles and lowest fat intake. We also detected a marginally significant (0.05 < 
P ≤ 0.10) interaction with fish intake (P-int = 0.09). Additionally, a 
marginally significant interaction was observed between proportion of calories 
from saturated fat and the WNT10A rs7349332 polymorphism. Our results suggest 
that genetic variability in the WNT pathway may play a role in colorectal 
adenoma formation or may partly mediate the increased risk of colorectal cancer 
associated with fat intake.
