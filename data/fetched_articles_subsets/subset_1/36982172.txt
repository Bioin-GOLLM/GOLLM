Secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice (PJ), collected from the duodenum, presents 
a valuable biomarker source for the (earlier) detection of pancreatic cancer 
(PC). Here, we evaluate the feasibility and performance of shallow sequencing to 
detect copy number variations (CNVs) in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from PJ for PC 
detection. First, we confirmed the feasibility of shallow sequencing in PJ (n = 
4), matched plasma (n = 3) and tissue samples (n = 4, microarray). Subsequently, 
shallow sequencing was performed on cfDNA from PJ of 26 cases (25 sporadic PC, 1 
high-grade dysplasia) and 19 controls with a hereditary or familial increased 
risk of PC. 40 of the 45 PJ samples met the quality criteria for cfDNA analysis. 
Nine individuals had an 8q24 gain (oncogene MYC; 23%; eight cases (33%) and one 
control (6%), p = 0.04); six had both a 2q gain (STAT1) and 5p loss (CDH10; 15%; 
four cases (7%) and two controls (13%), p = 0.72). The presence of an 8q24 gain 
differentiated the cases and controls, with a sensitivity of 33% (95% CI 16-55%) 
and specificity of 94% (95% CI 70-100%). The presence of either an 8q24 or 2q 
gain with a 5p loss was related to a sensitivity of 50% (95% CI 29-71%) and 
specificity of 81% (95% CI 54-96%). Shallow sequencing of PJ is feasible. The 
presence of an 8q24 gain in PJ shows promise as a biomarker for the detection of 
PC. Further research is required with a larger sample size and consecutively 
collected samples in high-risk individuals prior to implementation in a 
surveillance cohort.
