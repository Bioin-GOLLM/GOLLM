Activating mutations in RAS proto-oncogenes encode proteins with greater GTP 
binding. Such mutant proteins are responsible for many human cancers. Six new 
amino acids were discovered that can yield an activated Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
RAS2 protein when they are altered. These new RAS2 alleles were found among a 
collection of 35 random mutations that exhibit a dominant reduction of glycogen 
accumulation. The RAS2-P41S and RAS2-E99K alleles encode proteins that have lost 
responsiveness to GTPase activating proteins. They affect amino acids in loop 2 
and helix 3 respectively and illustrate that GTPase activating proteins 
recognize a larger portion of the RAS structure than previously realized. RAS2 
mutations E130K, S153F, A154T, and A157S alter amino acids proximal to the 
guanine binding site and probably influence nucleotide binding either directly 
or indirectly.
