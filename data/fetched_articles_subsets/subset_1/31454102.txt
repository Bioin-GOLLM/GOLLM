BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that some genetic polymorphisms associated with 
breast cancer susceptibility may also be associated with abortion. The TOX3 gene 
plays a key role during the onset of breast cancer, and reproductive factors 
such as abortion are risk factors for breast cancer. However, there is currently 
no study describing the relationship between the TOX3 rs3803662 C>T polymorphism 
and the risk of recurrent miscarriage. Therefore, we investigated whether the 
TOX3 rs3803662 C>T polymorphism is associated with recurrent miscarriage 
susceptibility in this case-control study.
METHODS: We recruited 248 recurrent miscarriage patients and 392 healthy 
controls from the southern Chinese population and performed genotyping using the 
TaqMan method.
RESULTS: The results showed no evidence that TOX3 rs3803662 C>T is associated 
with recurrent miscarriage (CT and CC: corrected OR = 1.038, 95% 
CI = 0.737-1.461, P = .8321; TT and CC: adjusted OR = 0.989, 95% 
CI = 0.591-1.656, P = .9659; dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.027, 95% 
CI = 0.742-1.423, P = .8712; recessive model: adjusted OR = 0.969, 95% 
CI = 0.600-1.566, P = .8975).
CONCLUSION: According to this study, the TOX3 rs3803662 C>T polymorphism may not 
be associated with recurrent miscarriage in the southern Chinese population. A 
larger multicenter study is needed to confirm the results.
