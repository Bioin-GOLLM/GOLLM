In the title compound, C(12)H(13)N(3)O(6), the dihydro-pyran ring adopts a near 
screw-boat conformation. The dihedral angle between the mean planes of the 
benzene and dihydro-pyran rings is 6.35 (5)°. An intra-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen 
bond generates an S(6) motif, which stabilizes the mol-ecular conformation. In 
the crystal, weak inter-molecular C-H⋯O, N-H⋯O and C-H⋯π hydrogen bonds 
contribute to the stabilization of the packing.
