Lung cancer is one of the malignancies with higher morbidity and mortality. 
Imaging plays an essential role in each phase of lung cancer management, from 
detection to assessment of response to treatment. The development of 
imaging-based artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential to play a 
key role in early detection and customized treatment planning. Computer-aided 
detection of lung nodules in screening programs has revolutionized the early 
detection of the disease. Moreover, the possibility to use AI approaches to 
identify patients at risk of developing lung cancer during their life can help a 
more targeted screening program. The combination of imaging features and 
clinical and laboratory data through AI models is giving promising results in 
the prediction of patients' outcomes, response to specific therapies, and risk 
for toxic reaction development. In this review, we provide an overview of the 
main imaging AI-based tools in lung cancer imaging, including automated lesion 
detection, characterization, segmentation, prediction of outcome, and treatment 
response to provide radiologists and clinicians with the foundation for these 
applications in a clinical scenario.
