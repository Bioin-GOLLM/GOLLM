Neuroblastoma is the primary cause of cancer death in childhood. METTL14 is 
tightly linked to cancer. However, whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the METTL14 gene could predispose to neuroblastoma susceptibility 
lacks evidence. With an epidemiology case-control study, associations between 
METTL14 gene SNPs and overall risk for neuroblastoma were estimated in 898 cases 
and 1,734 controls. Following that, stratified analysis was performed. Among the 
five analyzed SNPs, rs298982 G>A and rs62328061 A>G exhibited a significant 
association with decreased susceptibility to neuroblastoma, whereas the 
associations with increased neuroblastoma susceptibility were observed for 
rs9884978 G>A and rs4834698 T>C. Moreover, subjects carrying two to five risk 
genotypes were more inclined to develop neuroblastoma than those with zero to 
one risk genotypes. The stratified analysis further demonstrated the protective 
effect of rs298982 G>A and rs62328061 A>G, as well as the predisposing effect of 
rs4834698 T>C and two to five risk genotypes, in certain subgroups. Haplotype 
analysis was performed. Moreover, false-positive report probability analysis 
validated the reliability of the significant results. The expression 
quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that rs298982 is correlated with the 
expression levels of its surrounding genes. Our results suggest that some SNPs 
in the METTL14 gene are associated with predisposition to neuroblastoma.
