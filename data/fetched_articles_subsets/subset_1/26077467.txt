The inhibition of p53 activity by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been 
reported, but the precise molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we show that 
programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) selectively mediates HDAC3 dissociation from 
p53, which induces HDAC3 cleavage and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal 
degradation. Casein kinase 2 alpha phosphorylates PDCD5 at Ser-119 to enhance 
its stability and importin 13-mediated nuclear translocation of PDCD5. Genetic 
deletion of PDCD5 abrogates etoposide (ET)-induced p53 stabilization and HDAC3 
cleavage, indicating an essential role of PDCD5 in p53 activation. Restoration 
of PDCD5(WT) in PDCD5(-/-) MEFs restores ET-induced HDAC3 cleavage. Reduction of 
both PDCD5 and p53, but not reduction of either protein alone, significantly 
enhances in vivo tumorigenicity of AGS gastric cancer cells and correlates with 
poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. Our results define a mechanism for 
p53 activation via PDCD5-dependent HDAC3 decay under genotoxic stress 
conditions.
