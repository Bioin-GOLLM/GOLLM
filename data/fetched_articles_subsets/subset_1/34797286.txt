BACKGROUND: Recently, some studies have suggested that the association of 
apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) gene polymorphism with prostate 
cancer (PCa) risk, but there are still some controversies. Hence, we elaborated 
the relationship between APE1 rs1760944 and rs1130409 gene and PCa risk through 
systematic literature review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: As of March 2020, EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Science 
Direct/Elsevier, MEDLINE and CNKI were used for systematic literature retrieval 
to investigate the correlation between APE1 rs1760944 and rs1130409 gene 
polymorphism with PCa risk. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and 
Stata software.
RESULTS: Seven studies were distinguished, consists of 1769 cases of PCa 
patients and 2237 normal controls. Our results illustrated that there are 
significant correlation between the APE1 rs1760944 gene polymorphism and PCa in 
all genetic models (P < .05). The combined odds ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals were as follows: Additive model (ORs 0.62, 95%, CI [0.39, 0.97]); 
Codominant model (ORs 0.74, 95% CI [0.58, 0.95]); Dominant model (ORs 0.75, 95%, 
CI [0.59, 0.95]); Recessive model (ORs 0.63, 95% CI [0.41, 0.96]); Allele model 
(ORs 0.78, 95% CI [0.65, 0.94]). There also have significant associations 
between APE1 rs1130409 polymorphisms and PCa in all genetic models (P < .05). 
The combined odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were as follows: Additive 
model (ORs 1.37, 95%, CI [1.01, 1.85]); Codominant model (ORs 1.21, 95% CI 
[1.01, 1.44]); Dominant model (ORs 1.33, 95%, CI [1.02, 1.73]); Recessive model 
(ORs 1.74, 95% CI [1.06, 2.85]); Allele model (ORs 1.14, 95% CI [1.00, 1.29]).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that APE1 rs1760944 polymorphisms might be a 
protective factor of PCa, and APE1 rs1130409 is suggested to be a risk factor of 
PCa. APE1 rs1760944 and rs1130409 polymorphisms may be used in the risk 
assessment of PCa.
