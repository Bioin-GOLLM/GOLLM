Here we describe phasing anomalies observed in gradient sensitivity enhanced 
(15)N-(1)H HSQC spectra, and analyze their origin. It is shown that, as a result 
of (15)N off-resonance effects, dispersive contributions to the (1)H signal 
become detectable, and lead to (15)N-offset dependent phase errors. Strategies 
that effectively suppress these artifacts are presented.
