Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCAH) due to P450c21 (21-hydroxylase 
deficiency) is a common autosomal recessive disorder. This disorder is due to 
mutations in the CYP21A2 gene which is located at chromosome 6p21. The clinical 
features predominantly reflect androgen excess rather than adrenal insufficiency 
leading to an ascertainment bias favoring diagnosis in females. Treatment goals 
include normal linear growth velocity and "on-time" puberty in affected 
children. For adolescent and adult women, treatment goals include regularization 
of menses, prevention of progression of hirsutism, and fertility. This paper 
will review key aspects regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of 
NCAH.
