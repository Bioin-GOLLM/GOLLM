Nicastrin is required for amyloid precursor protein (APP) but not Notch 
processing, while anterior pharynx-defective 1 is dispensable for processing of 
both APP and Notch.

The γ-secretase complex is composed of at least four components: presenilin 1 or 
presenilin-2, nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective 1 (Aph-1), and 
presenilin enhancer 2. In this study, using knockout cell lines, our data 
demonstrated that knockout of NCT, as well as knockout of presenilin enhancer 2, 
completely blocked γ-secretase-catalyzed processing of C-terminal fragment 
(CTF)α and CTFβ, the C-terminal fragments of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
produced by α-secretase and β-secretase cleavages, respectively. Interestingly, 
in Aph-1-knockout cells, CTFα and CTFβ were still processed by γ-secretase, 
indicating Aph-1 is dispensable for APP processing. Furthermore, our results 
indicate that Aph-1 as well as NCT is not absolutely required for Notch 
processing, suggesting that NCT is differentially required for APP and Notch 
processing. In addition, our data revealed that components of the γ-secretase 
complex are also important for proteasome- and lysosome-dependent degradation of 
APP and that endogenous APP is mostly degraded by lysosome while exogenous APP 
is mainly degraded by proteasome. There are unanswered questions regarding the 
roles of each component of the γ-secretase complex in amyloid precursor protein 
(APP) and Notch processing. The most relevant, novel finding of this study is 
that nicastrin (NCT) is required for APP but not Notch processing, while Aph-1 
is not essential for processing of both APP and Notch, suggesting NCT as a 
therapeutic target to restrict Aβ formation without impairing Notch signaling.
