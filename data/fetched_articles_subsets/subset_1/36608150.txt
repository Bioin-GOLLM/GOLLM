Allergic diseases are a global health challenge. Individuals harboring 
loss-of-function variants in transforming growth factor-β receptor (TGFβR) genes 
have an increased prevalence of allergic disorders, including eosinophilic 
esophagitis. Allergic diseases typically localize to mucosal barriers, 
implicating epithelial dysfunction as a cardinal feature of allergic disease. 
Here, we describe an essential role for TGFβ in the control of tissue-specific 
immune homeostasis that provides mechanistic insight into these clinical 
associations. Mice expressing a TGFβR1 loss-of-function variant identified in 
atopic patients spontaneously develop disease that clinically, immunologically, 
histologically, and transcriptionally recapitulates eosinophilic esophagitis. In 
vivo and in vitro, TGFβR1 variant-expressing epithelial cells are 
hyperproliferative, fail to differentiate properly, and overexpress innate 
proinflammatory mediators, which persist in the absence of lymphocytes or 
external allergens. Together, our results support the concept that TGFβ plays a 
fundamental, nonredundant, epithelial cell-intrinsic role in controlling 
tissue-specific allergic inflammation that is independent of its role in 
adaptive immunity.
