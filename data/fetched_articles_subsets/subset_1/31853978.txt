Phosphorylation of translational repressor eukaryotic translation initiation 
factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) controls the initiation of 
cap-dependent translation, a type of protein synthesis that is frequently 
upregulated in human diseases such as cancer. Because of its critical cellular 
function, it is not surprising that multiple kinases can post-translationally 
modify 4E-BP1 to drive aberrant cap-dependent translation. We recently reported 
a site-selective chemoproteomic method for uncovering kinase-substrate 
interactions, and using this approach, we discovered the cyclin-dependent kinase 
(CDK)4 as a new 4E-BP1 kinase. Herein, we describe our extension of this work 
and reveal the role of CDK4 in modulating 4E-BP1 activity in the transition from 
mitosis to G1, thereby demonstrating a novel role for this kinase in cell cycle 
regulation.
