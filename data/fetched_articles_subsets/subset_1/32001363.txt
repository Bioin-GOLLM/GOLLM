Recently developed CRISPR-mediated base editors, which enable the generation of 
numerous nucleotide changes in target genomic regions, have been widely adopted 
for gene correction and generation of crop germplasms containing important 
gain-of-function genetic variations. However, to engineer target genes with 
unknown functional SNPs remains challenging. To address this issue, we present 
here a base-editing-mediated gene evolution (BEMGE) method, employing both 
Cas9n-based cytosine and adenine base editors as well as a single-guide RNA 
(sgRNA) library tiling the full-length coding region, for developing novel rice 
germplasms with mutations in any endogenous gene. To this end, OsALS1 was 
artificially evolved in rice cells using BEMGE through both 
Agrobacterium-mediated and particle-bombardment-mediated transformation. Four 
different types of amino acid substitutions in the evolved OsALS1, derived from 
two sites that have never been targeted by natural or human selection during 
rice domestication, were identified, conferring varying levels of tolerance to 
the herbicide bispyribac-sodium. Furthermore, the P171F substitution identified 
in a strong OsALS1 allele was quickly introduced into the commercial rice 
cultivar Nangeng 46 through precise base editing with the corresponding base 
editor and sgRNA. Collectively, these data indicate great potential of BEMGE in 
creating important genetic variants of target genes for crop improvement.
