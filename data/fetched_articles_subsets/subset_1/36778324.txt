OBJECTIVES: To characterize a bla CMY variant associated with 
ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) resistance from a serially collected Escherichia 
coli isolate.
METHODS: A patient with an intra-abdominal infection due to recurrent E. coli 
was treated with CZA. On day 48 of CZA therapy, E. coli with a CZA MIC of >256 
mg/L was identified from abdominal drainage. Illumina WGS was performed on all 
isolates to identify potential resistance mechanisms. Site-directed mutants of 
CMY β-lactamase were constructed to identify amino acid residues responsible for 
CZA resistance.
RESULTS: WGS revealed that all three isolates were E. coli ST410. The 
CZA-resistant strain uniquely acquired a novel CMY β-lactamase gene, herein 
called bla CMY-185 , harbored on an IncIγ-type conjugative plasmid. The CMY-185 
enzyme possessed four amino acid substitutions relative to CMY-2 including 
A114E, Q120K, V211S, and N346Y and conferred high-level CZA resistance with an 
MIC of 32 mg/L. Single CMY-2 mutants did not confer reduced CZA susceptibility. 
However, double and triple mutants containing N346Y previously associated with 
CZA resistance in other AmpC enzymes, conferred CZA MICs ranging between 4 and 
32 mg/L as well as reduced susceptibility to the newly developed cephalosporin, 
cefiderocol. Molecular modelling suggested that the N346Y substitution confers 
the reduction of avibactam inhibition due to the steric hindrance between the 
side chain of Y346 and the sulfate group of avibactam.
CONCLUSION: We identified CZA resistance in E. coli associated with a novel CMY 
variant. Unlike other AmpC enzymes, CMY-185 appears to require an additional 
substitution on top of N346Y to confer CZA resistance.
