Cancer is currently viewed as a disease of evolving genomic instability and 
abnormal epigenomic modifications. Most solid cancers harbor oncogenic gene 
mutations driven by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Apolipoprotein B mRNA 
editing catalytic polypeptide-like family (APOBEC) enzymes have an intrinsic 
deamination activity to convert cytosine to uracil during RNA editing and 
retrovirus or retrotransposon restriction. Beyond their natural defense in 
innate immunity, compelling evidence showed that a subclass of APOBEC3 can cause 
high mutation burden in various types of cancer genomes, and high expression 
subtypes of APOBEC3 may contribute to drug resistance and associate with 
clinical outcomes. The underlying molecular mechanisms of APOBEC-mediated 
hypermutation phenotype are poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the 
linkage of activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC3 enzymes to tumorigenesis, 
highlight the dysregulatory mechanisms of APOBEC3 activities during cancer 
development, and propose potential approaches to targeting APOBEC3-mediated 
mutagenesis for cancer interventions.
