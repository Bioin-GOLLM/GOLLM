A 71-year-old patient receiving combination chemotherapy (irinotecan, 
oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)) for metastatic pancreas cancer was 
admitted after her first cycle of chemotherapy with a severe and unexpectedly 
prolonged episode of neutropenic sepsis associated with pancytopenia and marked 
mucositis. Owing to the unusual picture, the patient was tested for mutations in 
the gene encoding the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)--an enzyme 
involved in the metabolism of the chemotherapy drug 5-FU. The patient was found 
to be heterozygous for a mutation, DPD IVS14+1G>A, leading to the severe 
toxicity exhibited following this regimen caused by delayed metabolism of 5-FU. 
She was treated aggressively with supportive care and recovered from this 
episode. Importantly she was subsequently switched to an alternative 
chemotherapy regimen to treat her disease. She continues to maintain an 
excellent quality of life some 9 months after her initial diagnosis on 
third-line chemotherapy.
