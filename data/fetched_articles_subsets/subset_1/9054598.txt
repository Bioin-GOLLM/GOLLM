Radon-222, a decay product of uranium-238 and a source of high linear energy 
transfer (LET) alpha-particles, has been implicated in the increased risk of 
lung cancer in uranium miners as well as non-miners. p53 mutation spectrum 
studies of radon-associated lung cancer have failed to show any specific 
mutational hot spot with the exception of a single study in which 31% of 
squamous cell and large cell lung cancers from uranium miners showed a p53 codon 
249 AGGarg --> ATGmet mutation. Although the results of laboratory studies 
indicate that double-strand breaks and deletions are the principal genetic 
alterations caused by alpha-particles, uncertainty still prevails in the 
description of DNA damage in radon-associated human lung cancer. In the present 
study, we have evaluated the mutability of p53 codons 249 and 250 to 
alpha-particles in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells using a highly 
sensitive genotypic mutation assay. Exposure of NHBE cells to a total dose of 4 
Gy (equivalent to approximately 1460 working level months in uranium mining) of 
high LET alpha-radiation induced codon 249 AGG --> AAG transitions and codon 250 
CCC --> ACC transversions with absolute mutation frequencies of 3.6 x 10(-7) and 
3.8 x 10(-7) respectively. This mutation spectrum is consistent with our 
previous report of radon-associated human lung cancer.
