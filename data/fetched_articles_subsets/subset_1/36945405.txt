Contraction of the human sarcomere is the result of interactions between myosin 
cross-bridges and actin filaments. Pathogenic variants in genes such as MYH7 , 
TPM1 , and TNNI3 that encode parts of the cardiac sarcomere cause muscle 
diseases that affect the heart, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy. In contrast, pathogenic variants in homologous genes MYH2 , TPM2 
, and TNNI2 , that encode parts of the skeletal muscle sarcomere, cause muscle 
diseases affecting skeletal muscle, such as the distal arthrogryposis (DA) 
syndromes and skeletal myopathies. To date, there have been few reports of genes 
(e.g., MYH7 ) encoding sarcomeric proteins in which the same pathogenic variant 
affects both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Moreover, none of the known genes 
underlying DA have been found to contain mutations that also cause cardiac 
abnormalities. We report five families with DA due to heterozygous missense 
variants in the gene actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1 ( ACTC1 ). ACTC1 encodes a 
highly conserved actin that binds to myosin in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. 
Mutations in ACTC1 have previously been found to underlie atrial septal defect, 
dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular 
noncompaction. Our discovery delineates a new DA condition due to mutations in 
ACTC1 and suggests that some functions of actin, alpha, cardiac muscle 1 are 
shared in cardiac and skeletal muscle.
