Endocrine Society guideline recommendations on diabetes technology in adults 
originate from the 2016 guideline titled "Diabetes Technology-Continuous 
Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Therapy and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in 
Adults: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline." Society 
recommendations on diabetes technology in children are contained in the 2011 
guideline titled "Continuous Glucose Monitoring: An Endocrine Society Clinical 
Practice Guideline." The field of diabetes technology is a rapidly advancing 
one, with new devices released annually and data from clinical trials published 
frequently. This report describes the most recent findings since the 2011 and 
2016 guidelines were written, combining summaries of new literature with the 
authors' clinical experience of new devices. Although we describe what we 
believe to be important scientific and technological updates since these 
guidelines were published, we are not advancing formal additions or amendments 
to previously offered recommendations.
