The title compound, C35H28N4O6S, crystallizes with two mol-ecules in the 
asymmetric unit. In both mol-ecules, the piperidine ring adopts a shallow-chair 
conformation, the thia-zole ring adopts a twisted conformation about the Cm-N 
bond (m = methine) and the pyrrole ring adopts an envelope conformation with the 
C atom shared with the thia-zole ring as the flap. In the crystal, inversion 
dimers linked by pairs of C-H⋯O inter-actions generate R 2 (2)(34) loops for one 
of the asymmetric mol-ecules. Further C-H⋯O links also involving the other 
mol-ecule lead to a three-dimesional network. The contribution of the highly 
disordered solvent to the scattering was removed with SQUEEZE option of PLATON 
[Spek (2009 ▶). Acta Cryst. D65, 148-155]. The solvent contribution is not 
included in the reported mol-ecular weight and density.
