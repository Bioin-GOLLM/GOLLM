Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant, inherited disease 
(OMIM 143890) characterized by elevated serum cholesterol bound to low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL). It is mainly caused by mutations of the low-density 
lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR). In this study, we investigated two Chinese 
pedigrees with FH. The probands were a 9-year-old boy and a 1-year-old boy, who 
had high LDL-C levels. The proband in family A showed skin xanthoma. We 
sequenced the promoter and all exons and exon-intron boundaries of the LDLR gene 
to detect potential mutations. Compound heterozygote of c.1747C>T and c.2054C>T 
was detected in the proband of family A, and a heterozygous indel mutation 
c.551_553 delGTAinsTT was discovered in the second family. The c.1747C>T and 
c.2054C>T mutations, which have been reported previously, result in His583Tyr 
and Pro685Leu substitutions, respectively. The novel c.551_553 delGTAinsTT indel 
mutation causes a frameshift, which results in a p.Cys184Phe fs21X mutation in 
the corresponding protein.
