Purified Drosophila indirect-flight-muscle actin and arthrin, an actin-ubiquitin 
conjugate, were ADP-ribosylated by Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and 
Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Phalloidin treatment inhibited the 
ADP-ribosylation of Drosophila actin and arthrin. Like actin, the 
ADP-ribose-arthrin linkage was sensitive towards hydroxylamine treatment, 
indicating arginine as the amino acid acceptor. Actin translated in vitro from 
the indirect-flight-muscle-specific gene Act88F was ADP-ribosylated by C. 
botulinum C2 toxin and C. perfringens iota toxin. Actin from the R177Q mutant of 
Act88F translated in vivo was not ADP-ribosylated confirming Arg-177 as the 
ADP-ribose acceptor. Mutant L176M actin was modified by both toxins, indicating 
that amino acid 176 of actin does not define the substrate specificity of C. 
botulinum C2 toxin. Whereas the gene products of various C-terminal mutants of 
Act88F translated in vitro (E334K, V339I, E364K, G368E, R372H) were substrates 
for ADP-ribosylation by C. botulinum C2 toxin and by C. perfringens iota toxin, 
neither toxin modified the N-terminal O-12 deletion mutant.
