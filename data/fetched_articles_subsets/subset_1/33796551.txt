The interplay between cancer genome and deregulated epigenomic control is 
critical for cancer initiation and progression. ASXL1 (Additional Sex combs-like 
1) is frequently mutated in tumors especially myeloid malignancies. However, 
there remains a debate whether the mutations are loss or gain-of-function. 
Mechanistically, ASXL1 forms a complex with BAP1 for the erasure of 
mono-ubiquitylation at lysine 119 on Histone H2A (H2AK119ub1), a well-known 
histone mark associated with transcription repression. Unexpectedly, this 
de-ubiquitylation complex has been genetically defined as a Polycomb Repressive 
complex though the regulatory mechanisms are elusive. In this review, we will 
discuss about the functions of ASXL1 in malignancies and reconcile seemingly 
paradoxical effects of ASXL1 or BAP1 loss on transcription regulation.
