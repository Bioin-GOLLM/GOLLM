BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI), and is associated with adverse outcomes. The study 
aimed to identify a miRNA signature for the early diagnosis of post-AMI AKI.
METHODS: A total of 108 patients admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) were 
divided into four subgroups: AMI-AKI-, AMI+AKI-, AMI+AKI+, and AMI-AKI+. 
Thirty-six miRNA candidates were selected based on an extensive literature 
review. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to determine the 
expression levels of these miRNAs in the serum collected on the day of CCU 
admittance. TargetScan 7.1 and miRDB databases were used for target prediction 
and Metacore 6.13 was used for pathway analysis.
RESULTS: Through a stepwise selection based on abundance, hemolytic effect and 
differential expression between four groups, 9 miRNAs were found to have 
significantly differential expression levels as potential biomarkers for 
post-AMI AKI specifically. Noticeably, the expression levels of miR-24, miR-23a 
and miR-145 were significantly down-regulated in AMI+AKI+ patients compared to 
those in AMI+AKI- patients. Combination of the three miRNAs as a panel showed 
the best performance in the early detection of AKI following AMI (AUC = 0.853, 
sensitivity 95.65%), compared to the analysis of serum neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (AUC = 0.735, sensitivity 63.16%). Furthermore, 
bioinformatic analysis indicated that these three miRNAs regulate the 
transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and involve in apoptosis and 
fibrosis in AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study identify a unique circulating miRNA 
signature (miR-24-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-145-5p) that can potentially early detect 
AKI following AMI and may be involved in renal injury and fibrosis in post-AMI 
AKI pathogenesis.
