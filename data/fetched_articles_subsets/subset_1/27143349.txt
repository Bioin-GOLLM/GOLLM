OBJECTIVES: Nine classes of glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) are available for 
patients with type 2 diabetes prior to starting insulin. This study's aim was to 
determine if the number of GLAs is associated with a difference in glycated 
hemoglobin (A1C) at insulin initiation in the US Department of Veterans Affairs 
Health Care System (VAHCS).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort with national Veterans Health Administration 
data was created. Veterans with type 2 diabetes and first insulin prescription 
filled in the VAHCS between January 1, 2009, and August 28, 2013, were 
identified. Included veterans refilled insulin within the first year, had an A1C 
> 7% (53 mmol/mol) at least 60 days prior to insulin initiation, and received a 
GLA within 6 months prior to insulin. Veterans were grouped into 4 cohorts 
according to the number of GLAs used.
RESULTS: A total of 90,497 veterans with type 2 diabetes met inclusion criteria. 
Insulin was initiated at a mean A1C of 9.9% (85 mmol/mol). The mean A1Cs prior 
to insulin for 1, 2, 3, or > 3 GLAs were 10.3% (89 mmol/mol), 9.9% (85 
mmol/mol), 9.6% (81 mmol/mol), and 9.6% (81 mmol/mol), respectively. Months to 
insulin increased with the number of GLA trials and prolonged the time veterans 
were exposed to A1C > 8% (64 mmol/mol).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple glucose-lowering drug classes are associated with a 
numerical, but not a clinical, difference in A1C at insulin initiation in the 
closed formulary of the VAHCS.
