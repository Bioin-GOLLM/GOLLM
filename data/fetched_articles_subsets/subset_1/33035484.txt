The nanoscale protein architecture of the kinetochore plays an integral role in 
specifying the mechanisms underlying its functions in chromosome segregation. 
However, defining this architecture in human cells remains challenging because 
of the large size and compositional complexity of the kinetochore. Here, we use 
Förster resonance energy transfer to reveal the architecture of individual 
kinetochore-microtubule attachments in human cells. We find that the 
microtubule-binding domains of the Ndc80 complex cluster at the microtubule plus 
end. This clustering occurs only after microtubule attachment, and it increases 
proportionally with centromeric tension. Surprisingly, Ndc80 complex clustering 
is independent of the organization and number of its centromeric receptors. 
Moreover, this clustering is similar in yeast and human kinetochores despite 
significant differences in their centromeric organizations. These and other data 
suggest that the microtubule-binding interface of the human kinetochore behaves 
like a flexible "lawn" despite being nucleated by repeating biochemical 
subunits.
