AIM: To explore the potential association between SNPs in transglutaminase 5 
(TGM5), phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2B (PPAP2B) and proteasome subunit, 
alpha type 4 (PSMA4) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) susceptibility in 
Chinese patients who were non-smokers.
SETTING AND DESIGN: A case-controlled study was conducted among Chinese 
population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred NSCLC patients and 200 healthy controls who 
were age and sex matched were genotyped for rs504417 of TGM5, rs1261411 of 
PPAP2B and rs7164594 of PSMA4. Genotyping was performed using the Sequenom 
MassARRAY system based on the chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption 
ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry platform.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The association between genotype and lung cancer risk 
was evaluated by computing the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 
from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference for the TGM5 rs504417, PPAP2B 
rs1261411 and PSMA4 rs716459 in allele or genotype frequencies, whether between 
controls and NSCLC or between controls and subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: polymorphisms of TGM5, PPAP2B and PSMA4 are not major contributors 
to NSCLC susceptibility, this primarily be attributed to the significantly 
distinct genetic background of Asian populations from western populations.
