The Src homology 2-containing tyrosine phosphatase, Shp-2, is a crucial enzyme 
that mediates intracellular signaling and is implicated in cell proliferation 
and differentiation. Here we investigated the involvement of the Shp-2 tyrosine 
phosphatase in determining the downstream signaling pathways initiated by the 
Ret oncogene, carrying either the cysteine 634 to tyrosine or the methionine 918 
to threonine substitutions. These mutations convert the receptor tyrosine 
kinase, Ret, into a dominant transforming protein and induce constitutive 
activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity leading to congenital and 
sporadic cancers in neuroendocrine organs. Using the PC12, rat pheochromocytoma 
cell line, as model system, we show that Shp-2 mediates immediate-early gene 
expression if induced by either of the mutant alleles. Furthermore, we show that 
Shp-2 activity is required for RetM918T-induced Akt activation. The results 
indicate that Shp-2 is a downstream mediator of the mutated receptors RetC634Y 
and RetM918T, thus suggesting that it may act as a limiting factor in 
Ret-associated endocrine tumors, in the neoplastic syndromes multiple endocrine 
neoplasia types 2A and 2B.
