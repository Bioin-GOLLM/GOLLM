Lumen development is a crucial phase in tubulogenesis, although its molecular 
mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we discovered an ELMO 
domain-containing 3 (ELMOD3), which belongs to ADP-ribosylation factor 
GTPase-activating protein family, was necessary to form the notochord lumen in 
Ciona larvae. We demonstrated that ELMOD3 interacted with lipid raft protein 
Flotillin2 and regulated its subcellular localization. The loss-of-function of 
Flotillin2 prevented notochord lumen formation. Furthermore, we found that 
ELMOD3 also interacted with Rab1A, which is the regulatory GTPase for vesicle 
trafficking and located at the notochord cell surface. Rab1A mutations arrested 
the lumen formation, phenocopying the loss-of-function of ELMOD3 and Flotillin2. 
Our findings further suggested that Rab1A interactions influenced Flotillin2 
localization. We thus identified a unique pathway in which ELMOD3 interacted 
with Rab1A, which controlled the Flotillin2-mediated vesicle trafficking from 
cytoplasm to apical membrane, required for Ciona notochord lumen formation.
