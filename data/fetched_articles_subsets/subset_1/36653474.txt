Human cancers often re-express germline factors, yet their mechanistic role in 
oncogenesis and cancer progression remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that 
DEAD-box helicase 4 (DDX4), a germline factor and RNA helicase conserved in all 
multicellular organisms, contributes to increased cell motility and 
cisplatin-mediated drug resistance in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. 
Proteomic analysis suggests that DDX4 expression upregulates proteins related to 
DNA repair and immune/inflammatory response. Consistent with these trends in 
cell lines, DDX4 depletion compromised in vivo tumor development while its 
overexpression enhanced tumor growth even after cisplatin treatment in nude 
mice. Further, the relatively higher DDX4 expression in SCLC patients correlates 
with decreased survival and shows increased expression of immune/inflammatory 
response markers. Taken together, we propose that DDX4 increases SCLC cell 
survival, by increasing the DNA damage and immune response pathways, especially 
under challenging conditions such as cisplatin treatment.
