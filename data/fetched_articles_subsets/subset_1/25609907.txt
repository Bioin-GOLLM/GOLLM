We report a patient with progression to a macula-off tractional retinal 
detachment in a fellow eye after a contralateral intraoperative intravitreal 
bevacizumab injection. A 32-year-old diabetic man noted decreased vision in his 
left eye 1 week following 25 gauge pars plana vitrectomy, gas tamponade, and 
intraoperative injection of bevacizumab in his right eye. Left eye visual acuity 
decreased from 20/80 to 20/200, and macula-off tractional retinal detachment was 
seen on clinical exam and imaging. Progression of tractional retinal detachment 
associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy in a fellow eye after a 
contralateral intraoperative intravitreal bevacizumab injection may occur.
