BACKGROUND: Epigenetic reprogramming during early mammalian embryonic and germ 
cell development is a genome-wide process. CpG islands (CGIs), central to the 
regulation of mammalian gene expression, are exceptional in terms of whether, 
when and how they are affected by epigenetic reprogramming.
RESULTS: We investigated the DNA sequences of CGIs in the context of genome-wide 
data on DNA methylation and transcription during oogenesis and early 
embryogenesis to identify signals associated with methylation establishment and 
protection from de novo methylation in oocytes and associated with 
post-fertilisation methylation maintenance. We find no evidence for a 
characteristic DNA sequence motif in oocyte-methylated CGIs. Neither do we find 
evidence for a general role of regular CpG spacing in methylation establishment 
at CGIs in oocytes. In contrast, the resistance of most CGIs to de novo 
methylation during oogenesis is associated with the motif CGCGC, the recognition 
site of E2f1 and E2f2, transcription factors highly expressed specifically in 
oocytes. This association is independent of prominent known 
hypomethylation-associated factors: CGI promoter activity, H3K4me3, Cfp1 binding 
or R-loop formation potential.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a DNA sequence-independent and 
transcription-driven model of de novo CGI methylation during oogenesis. In 
contrast, our results for CGIs that remain unmethylated are consistent with a 
model of protection from methylation involving sequence recognition by 
DNA-binding proteins, E2f1 and E2f2 being probable candidates.
