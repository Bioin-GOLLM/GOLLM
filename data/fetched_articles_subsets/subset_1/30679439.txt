Understanding HIV remission in rare individuals who initiated antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) soon after infection and then discontinued, may inform HIV cure 
interventions. Here we describe features of virus and host of a perinatally 
HIV-1 infected child with long-term sustained virological control. The child 
received early limited ART in the Children with HIV Early antiRetroviral therapy 
(CHER) trial. At age 9.5 years, diagnostic tests for HIV are negative and the 
child has characteristics similar to uninfected children that include a high 
CD4:CD8 ratio, low T cell activation and low CCR5 expression. Virus persistence 
(HIV-1 DNA and plasma RNA) is confirmed with sensitive methods, but 
replication-competent virus is not detected. The child has weak HIV-specific 
antibody and T cell responses. Furthermore, we determine his HLA and KIR 
genotypes. This case aids in understanding post-treatment control and may help 
design of future intervention strategies.
