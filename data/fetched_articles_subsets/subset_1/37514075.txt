Earlier studies with montelukast (M) and telmisartan (T) have revealed their 
potential antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) but have not 
assessed their efficacy against emerging Variants of Concern (VOCs) such as 
Omicron. Our research fills this gap by investigating these drugs' impact on 
VOCs, a topic that current scientific literature has largely overlooked. We 
employed computational methodologies, including molecular mechanics and machine 
learning tools, to identify drugs that could potentially disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 
spike RBD-ACE2 protein interaction. This led to the identification of two 
FDA-approved small molecule drugs, M and T, conventionally used for treating 
asthma and hypertension, respectively. Our study presents an additional 
potential use for these drugs as antivirals. Our results show that both M and T 
can inhibit not only the WT SARS-CoV-2 but also, in the case of M, the Omicron 
variant, without reaching cytotoxic concentrations. This novel finding fills an 
existing gap in the literature and introduces the possibility of repurposing 
these drugs for SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, an essential step in responding to the evolving 
global pandemic.
