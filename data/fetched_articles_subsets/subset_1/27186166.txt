INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of metformin 
and sitagliptin on glycolipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes after different 
diets.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed with a high fat 
diet followed by streptozotocin treatment to induce type 2 diabetes. Then all 
rats were randomly divided into a control group, a metformin group (200 mg/kg), 
and a sitagliptin group (10 mg/kg). Each group was further divided into 4 groups 
receiving one load of high carbohydrate diet (45% glucose, 4.5 ml/kg), high fat 
diet (20% lipid emulsion, 4.5 ml/kg), high protein diet (20% whey protein, 10 
ml/kg) or mixed meal, respectively. The caloric densities were all 33 kJ/kg. 
Postprandial blood glucose (P2BG), triglyceride (TG), glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1), glucagon and insulin levels were measured.
RESULTS: In the high carbohydrate group, sitagliptin was more efficient in 
lowering P2BG compared with metformin (p < 0.05). In the high-fat group, 
metformin was more powerful in lowering TG (p < 0.05) and P2BG (p < 0.05) levels 
because of its improvement of insulin sensitivity. In the high protein diet 
group, metformin did not reduce the P2BG level (p > 0.05), although it did 
reduce the TG level (p < 0.05). In the mixed diet group, metformin was more 
efficient in lowering P2BG (p < 0.05) but had a similar effect on TG (p > 0.05) 
compared with sitagliptin.
CONCLUSIONS: In the type 2 diabetic model, metformin and sitagliptin have 
different effects on glycolipid metabolism after different diets. If it is 
proved in type 2 diabetic patients, then different medicines may be recommended 
according to different diets in order to improve glycolipid metabolism.
