Coexistence (collision) of two different neoplasms in the same lesion has 
previously been documented by several authors. In this report, we describe a 
13-year-old boy with xeroderma pigmentosum presenting with squamous-cell 
carcinoma and melanoma arising at the same site on the nose. 
Histopathologically, the melanoma component of the lesion was located mainly 
eccentrically to the squamous-cell carcinoma component. Immunohistochemical 
stains confirmed the histopathologic findings. Mutations for p53 assessed using 
single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing analysis revealed a 
CC-to-TT transition at codon 159 of the p53 gene in the squamous-cell component 
but not in the melanoma component. This finding suggests a possible role for UV 
in the pathogenesis of at least the squamous-cell component of the tumor. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a collision tumor comprising 
squamous-cell carcinoma and melanoma arising in childhood.
