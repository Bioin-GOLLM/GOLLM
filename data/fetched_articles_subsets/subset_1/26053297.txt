Capsaicin bestows spiciness by activating TRPV1 channel with exquisite potency 
and selectivity. Although a capsaicin-bound channel structure was previously 
resolved by cryo-EM at 4.2- to 4.5-Ã… resolution, capsaicin was registered as a 
small electron density, reflecting neither its chemical structure nor specific 
ligand-channel interactions--important details required for mechanistic 
understanding. We obtained the missing atomic-level details by iterative 
computation and confirmed them by systematic site-specific functional tests. We 
observed that the bound capsaicin takes a 'tail-up, head-down' configuration. 
The vanillyl and amide groups form specific interactions to anchor its bound 
position, while the aliphatic tail may sample a range of conformations, making 
it invisible in cryo-EM images. Capsaicin stabilizes TRPV1's open state by 
'pull-and-contact' interactions between the vanillyl group and the S4-S5 linker. 
Our study provides a structural mechanism for the agonistic function of 
capsaicin and its analogs, and demonstrates an effective approach to obtain 
atomic-level information from cryo-EM structures.
