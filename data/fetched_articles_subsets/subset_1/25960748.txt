This study evaluated the effects of the supplementation with aqueous extract of 
Agaricus blazei Murrill (ABM) on biometric and blood parameters and quantitative 
morphology of the myenteric plexus and jejunal wall in aging Wistar rats. The 
animals were euthanized at 7 (C7), 12 (C12 and CA12), and 23 months of age (C23 
and CA23). The CA12 and CA23 groups received a daily dose of ABM extract 
(26 mg/animal) via gavage, beginning at 7 months of age. A reduction in food 
intake was observed with aging, with increases in the Lee index, retroperitoneal 
fat, intestinal length, and levels of total cholesterol and total proteins. 
Aging led to a reduction of the total wall thickness, mucosa tunic, villus 
height, crypt depth, and number of goblet cells. In the myenteric plexus, aging 
quantitatively decreased the population of HuC/D(+) neuronal and S100(+) glial 
cells, with maintenance of the nNOS(+) nitrergic subpopulation and increase in 
the cell body area of these populations. Supplementation with the ABM extract 
preserved the myenteric plexus in old animals, in which no differences were 
detected in the density and cell body profile of neurons and glial cells in the 
CA12 and CA23 groups, compared with C7 group. The supplementation with the 
aqueous extract of ABM efficiently maintained myenteric plexus homeostasis, 
which positively influenced the physiology and prevented the death of the 
neurons and glial cells.
