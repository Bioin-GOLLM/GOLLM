N-Benzylphenethylamines are novel psychedelic substances increasingly used for 
research, diagnostic, or recreational purposes. To date, only a few metabolism 
studies have been conducted for N-2-methoxybenzylated compounds (NBOMes). Thus, 
the available 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-((2-methoxybenzyl)amino)ethyl)benzonitrile 
(25CN-NBOMe) metabolism data are limited. Herein, we investigated the metabolic 
profile of 25CN-NBOMe in vivo in rats and in vitro in Cunninghamella elegans (C. 
elegans) mycelium and human liver microsomes. Phase I and phase II metabolites 
were first detected in an untargeted screening, followed by liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identification of the most 
abundant metabolites by comparison with in-house synthesized reference 
materials. The major metabolic pathways described within this study (mono- and 
bis-O-demethylation, hydroxylation at different positions, and combinations 
thereof, followed by the glucuronidation, sulfation, and/or N-acetylation of 
primary metabolites) generally correspond to the results of previously reported 
metabolism of several other NBOMes. The cyano functional group was either 
hydrolyzed to the respective amide or carboxylic acid or remained untouched. 
Differences between species should be taken into account in studies of the 
metabolism of novel substances.
