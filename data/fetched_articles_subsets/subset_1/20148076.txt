Gene conversion is an important biological process that involves the transfer of 
genetic (sequence) information from one gene to another. This can have a variety 
of effects on an organism, both short-term and long-term and both positive and 
detrimental. In an effort to better understand this process, we searched through 
over 3,000 abstracts that contain research on gene conversions, tagging the 
important data and performing an analysis on what we extract. Through this we 
established trends that give a better insight into gene conversion research and 
genetic research in general. Our results show the importance of the process and 
the importance of continuing gene conversion research.
