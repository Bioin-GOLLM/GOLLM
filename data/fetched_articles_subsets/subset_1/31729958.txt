BACKGROUND: White rot is one of the most dangerous fungal diseases and can 
considerably affect grape berry production and quality. However, few studies 
have focused on this disease, and thus, finding candidate white rot resistance 
genes is of great importance for breeding resistant grapevine cultivars. Based 
on field observations and indoor experiments, the cultivars "Victoria" and 
"Zhuosexiang" showed significant differences in white rot resistance. For 
understanding the molecular mechanisms behind it, different phenotypes of 
grapevine leaves were used for RNA sequencing via Illumina and single-molecule 
real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology.
RESULTS: A transcript library containing 53,906 reads, including known and novel 
transcripts, was constructed following the full-length transcriptome sequencing 
of the two grapevine cultivars. Genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and 
jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis pathways showed different expression levels. 
Furthermore, four key transcription factors (TFs), NPR1, TGA4, Pti6, and MYC2, 
all involved in the SA and JA signal pathways were identified, and the 
expression profile revealed the different regulation of the pathogenesis related 
protein1 (PR1) resistance gene, as mediated by the four TFs.
CONCLUSIONS: Full-length transcript sequencing can substantially improve the 
accuracy and integrity of gene prediction and gene function research in 
grapevine. Our results contribute to identify candidate resistance genes and 
improve our understanding of the genes and regulatory mechanisms involved in 
grapevine resistance to white rot.
