BACKGROUND: To investigate the contribution of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) 
gene pharmacogenetics (G2677T/A and C3435T) to the efficacy of azathioprine in 
inducing remission in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: A cohort of 327 unrelated Spanish patients with CD recruited from a 
single center was studied. All patients were rigorously followed up for at least 
2 years (mean time, 11.5 years). A case-control analysis of MDR1 G2677T/A and 
C3435T SNPs and 2 loci haplotypes in 112 steroid-dependent CD patients treated 
with azathioprine was performed. Patients were classified on the basis of 
response to azathioprine.
RESULTS: A total 76 patients treated with azathioprine for longer than 3 months 
were included. Remission was achieved in 42 CD patients (55.3%). A higher 
frequency of the 2677TT genotype was found in nonresponders than in responders 
(17.65% versus 7.14%; OR = 2.8; 95% CI; 0.6-12.1; P = 0.11). Nonresponders to 
azathioprine were found to have a higher frequency of the 3435TT genotype than 
did CD patients who had achieved clinical remission (17.64% versus 4.76%; OR = 
4.3; 95% CI, 0.8-22.8; P = 0.06). The 2677T/3435T haplotype was also more 
abundant in nonresponders (29.4% versus 20.2%), whereas the 2677G/3435C 
haplotype was more frequent in responders (58.3% versus 47.1%). Lack of response 
to azathioprine therapy in CD patients was 1.8-fold greater in carriers of the 
2677T/3435T haplotype than in carriers of the 2677G/3435C haplotype (OR = 1.8; 
95% CI, 0.82-3.9; P = 0.14).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study indicate higher frequencies of the 2677TT 
and 3435TT genotypes and the 2677T/3435T haplotype in CD patients who did not 
respond to azathioprine. Additional replications in independent populations 
would confirm the real impact of these polymorphisms in response to azathioprine 
therapy.
