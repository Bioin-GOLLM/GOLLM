Jasmonic acid (JA) carboxyl methyltransferase (JMT), a key enzyme in 
jasmonate-regulated plant responses, may be involved in plant defense and 
development by methylating JA to MeJA, thus influencing the concentrations of 
MeJA in plant. In this study, we isolated the JMT gene from Salvia miltiorrhiza, 
an important medicinal plant widely used to treat cardiovascular disease. We 
present a genetic manipulation strategy to enhance the production of phenolic 
acids by overexpresion SmJMT in S. miltiorrhiza. Global transcriptomic analysis 
using RNA sequencing showed that the expression levels of genes involved in the 
biosynthesis pathway of phenolic acids and MeJA were upregulated in the 
overexpression lines. In addition, the levels of endogenous MeJA, and the 
accumulation of rosmarinic acid (RA) and salvianolic acid (Sal B), as well as 
the concentrations of total phenolics and total flavonoids in transgenic lines, 
were significantly elevated compared with the untransformed control. Our results 
demonstrate that overexpression of SmJMT promotes the production of phenolic 
acids through simultaneously activating genes encoding key enzymes involved in 
the biosynthesis pathway of phenolic acids and enhancing the endogenous MeJA 
levels in S. miltiorrhiza.
