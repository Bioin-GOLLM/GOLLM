PURPOSE: The relationship between response to clopidogrel and early neurological 
deterioration (END) after acute ischemic stroke (IS) is not well defined. The 
aim of present study was to evaluate the associations of clopidogrel resistance 
(CR) with END, and stratified analyze the effectiveness of clopidogrel alone and 
clopidogrel plus aspirin for the prevention of END.
RESULTS: A total of 375 patients, 144 patients were received clopidogrel alone, 
231 patients took clopidogrel plus aspirin. CR occurred in 153 patients (40.8%). 
95 (25.3%) patients developed END within the first 10 days. Platelet aggregation 
was higher on admission, and inhibition of platelet aggregation was 
significantly lower in patients with END than patients without END. Diabetes 
mellitus, CR, and clopidogrel plus aspirin were independently associated with 
END. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel can inhibit both 
arachidonic acid (AA)-induced and ADP-induced platelet aggregation.
METHODS: This was a prospective, two-center study. A total of 375 IS patients 
taking clopidogrel alone or clopidogrel plus aspirin were enrolled. Platelet 
aggregation was measured before and after the 7-10 day treatment. CR was 
assessed by adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation. The 
primary endpoint was END within the 10 days after admission. The secondary 
endpoint was a composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, 
and death during the 10 days after admission.
CONCLUSIONS: CR and END are fairly common after acute IS. CR is associated with 
higher risk of END. Clopidogrel plus aspirin combination therapy provides 
greater inhibition of platelet aggregation, and may afford protection against 
END.
