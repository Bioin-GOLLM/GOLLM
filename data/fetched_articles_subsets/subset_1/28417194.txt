PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of three BCL2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 
i.e., c.-938C>A (rs2279115), c.21G>A (rs1801018), and c.*2203A>G (rs4987853) on 
survival in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
METHODS: We analyzed 179 patients who underwent surgical treatment for bladder 
cancer at the Clinic of Urology, University Hospital Essen, Germany. Genomic DNA 
was extracted and genotyped for the polymorphisms. For all polymorphisms, 
linkage analysis was performed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were 
used to determine the putative impact of the three polymorphisms on outcome.
RESULTS: c.-938C>A and c.21G>A, but not c.*2203A>G, are in strong linkage 
disequilibrium (D' 0.96). We found a significant association between c.-938C>A 
and relapse-free survival (p = 0.024) with an allele dose effect. In the same 
way, c.21G>A had a significant impact on both relapse-free survival (p = 0.009) 
and progression-free survival (p = 0.012), as well as a pronounced allele dose 
effect. Regression analysis proved c.21G>A and c.-938C>A, to be an independent 
risk factor in univariate and multivariable analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, both c.-938C>A and c.21G>A showed a significant 
impact on outcome with TCC of the bladder. Due to the linkage disequilibrium of 
both SNPs, maybe, only one of them could mediate this effect. In multivariable 
analysis, however, both proved to be independently associated with overall 
survival. Contrary to other findings which found the c.-938C>A mainly 
influencing outcome, our data may suggest that the main effect on TCC could be 
due to the c.21G>A polymorphism.
