Far upstream element-binding protein-1 (FBP-1) binds to an upstream element of 
the c-myc promoter and regulates the c-myc mRNA level. Earlier, FBP-1 was 
identified as a candidate substrate of caspase-7. Here, we report that FBP-1 is 
cleaved by executor caspases, both in vitro and during apoptosis. Cleavage 
occurs at the caspase consensus site (DQPD(74)) located within the classical 
bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence. In cells subjected to apoptotic 
stimuli, the caspase-mediated cleavage of FBP-1 leads to its decreased presence 
in the nucleus, concomitant with the marked downregulation of c-Myc and its 
various target proteins. By contrast, cells transfected with a non-cleavable 
mutant of FBP-1 (D74A) maintain higher levels of c-Myc and are protected from 
apoptosis. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the oncogenic 
potential of c-Myc is 'switched off' after apoptosis induction as a consequence 
of the caspase-mediated cleavage of FBP-1.
