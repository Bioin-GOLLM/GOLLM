Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is an extremely rare tumor, which 
mainly originates from FDCs in the lymph nodes. Sometimes FDCS can arise from 
outside the lymph nodes due to the existence of acquired lymphoid tissue, which 
becomes the histological basis of the tumor. The diagnosis of FDCS, particularly 
extranodal FDCS, presents a challenge for pathologists and hematopathologists. 
The present study presents two cases of extranodal FDCS based on clinical 
features and histomorphology. Soft tissue of the chest wall was involved in case 
1 and right tonsil tissue in case 2. Case 1 underwent surgery, and was in good 
health post-operatively. During the 5-month post-operative follow-up period, the 
patient was healthy in all respects. Case 2 received surgery combined with 
radiotherapy, and the follow-up data reported that the patient remained alive, 
without signs of recurrence or metastasis during the 4-month post-operative 
follow-up period. Additionally, a total of 102 cases of extranodal FDCS were 
retrieved from the literature, which were extracted and reviewed carefully. The 
rates of recurrence, metastasis and mortality were 14.63 (12/82), 17.07 (14/82) 
and 8.29% (15/82), respectively. The overall survival rates of the 102 cases, 
showing 2-year total survival rates, were 70%, the same with that of 5-year 
total survival rates. The 2-year tumor-free total survival rates were 68%, and 
the 5-year equivalents were 32%. Female patients had a poorer prognosis than 
male patients (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier estimation presented no statistically 
significant differences between disease-free survival rates or overall survival 
rates and age, tumor size or treatment (P>0.05).
