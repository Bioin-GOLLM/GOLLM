Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that progresses into 
systemic inflammation and joint deformity. RA diagnosis is a complicated 
procedure, and early diagnostic methods are insufficient. Therefore, in this 
study, we attempted to identify new markers to improve the accuracy of RA 
prescreening. e identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) by using 
liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry in health-prescreening sera with 
high rheumatoid factor (RF) values, and compared the findings with those from 
sera with normal RF values. We identified 93 DEPs; of these, 36 were 
upregulated, and 57 were downregulated in high-RF sera. Pathway analysis 
revealed that these DEPs were related to immune responses. Additionally, four 
DEPs were statistically analyzed by proteomic analysis; of these, SAA4 was 
significantly validated in individual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. 
Moreover, SAA4 was significantly upregulated in RA patients (n = 40, 66.43 ± 
12.97 ng/mL) compared with normal controls (n = 40, 4.79 ± 0.95 ng/mL) and had a 
higher area under the curve than C-reactive protein. Thus, we identified SAA4 as 
a protein that was positively correlated with RF and RA. SAA4 may represent a 
novel prescreening marker for the diagnosis of RA.
