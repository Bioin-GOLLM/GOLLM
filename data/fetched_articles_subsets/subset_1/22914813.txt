Atrial fibrillation (AF) not only is an independent risk factor for death but 
also confers significant risk of morbidity from stroke associated with left 
atrial thrombus. The association of interleukin 6 (IL-6) polymorphism with 
thrombus in AF has not been investigated before. We carried out a case-control 
study in Han Chinese. The IL-6 -634C/G genotypes of 31 patients with thrombus 
and 45 patients without thrombus were detected by polymerase chain reaction and 
restriction fragment length polymorphism. The frequencies of the IL-6 genotypes 
(CC, CG, and GG) were 29.03%, 54.54%, and 16.13% for the patients with thrombus, 
and 55.56%, 40.00%, and 4.44% for the patients without thrombus, respectively (P 
= .0391). Compared with the CC genotype, the G allele carriers (CG + GG) had a 
2.79-fold increased risk of thrombus or severe spontaneous echocontrast (SEC). 
These results suggest that IL-6 -634C/G polymorphism is associated with thrombus 
and severe SEC, and the G allele is an independent risk for thrombus and severe 
SEC in Han Chinese patients with AF.
