Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are severe 
adverse drug reactions, characterized by extensive epidermal detachment and 
erosions of mucous membrane. SJS/TEN is one of the most serious adverse 
reactions to Nevirapine (NVP) treatment, commonly used in developing countries 
as first-line treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. In the last 
years TRAF3IP2 gene variants had been described as associated with 
susceptibility to several diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. We 
hypothesized that this gene, involved in immune response and in NF-ÎºB 
activation, could also be implicated in the SJS/TEN susceptibility. We performed 
a full resequencing of TRAF3IP2 gene in a population of patients treated with 
NVP. Twenty-seven patients with NVP-induced SJS/TEN and 78 controls, all from 
Mozambique, were enrolled. We identified eight exonic and three intronic already 
described variants. The case/control association analysis highlighted an 
association between the rs76228616 SNP in exon 2 and the SJS/TEN susceptibility. 
In particular, the variant allele (C) resulted significantly associated with a 
higher risk to develop SJS/TEN (p = 0.012 and OR = 3.65 (95% CI 1.33-10.01)). A 
multivariate analysis by logistic regression confirmed its significant 
contribution (p = 0.027, OR = 4.39 (95% CI 1.19-16.23)). In conclusion, our 
study suggests that a variant in TRAF3IP2 gene could be involved in 
susceptibility to SJS/TEN.
