Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease and one 
of the most common inherited tumor predisposition syndromes, affecting 1 in 3000 
individuals worldwide. The NF1 gene encodes neurofibromin, a large protein with 
RAS GTP-ase activating (RAS-GAP) activity, and loss of NF1 results in increased 
RAS signaling. Neurofibromin contains many other domains, and there is 
considerable evidence that these domains play a role in some manifestations of 
NF1. Investigating the role of these domains as well as the various signaling 
pathways that neurofibromin regulates and interacts with will provide a better 
understanding of how neurofibromin acts to suppress tumor development and 
potentially open new therapeutic avenues. In this review, we discuss what is 
known about the structure of neurofibromin, its interactions with other proteins 
and signaling pathways, its role in development and differentiation, and its 
function as a tumor suppressor. Finally, we discuss the latest research on 
potential therapeutics for neurofibromin-deficient neoplasms.
