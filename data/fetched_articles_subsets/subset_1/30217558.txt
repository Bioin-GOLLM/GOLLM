Maintenance of epigenetic integrity relies on coordinated recycling and 
partitioning of parental histones and deposition of newly synthesized histones 
during DNA replication. This process depends upon a poorly characterized network 
of histone chaperones, remodelers, and binding proteins. Here we implicate the 
POLE3-POLE4 subcomplex of the leading-strand polymerase, Polε, in 
replication-coupled nucleosome assembly through its ability to selectively bind 
to histones H3-H4. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and 
physical mapping, we define minimal domains necessary for interaction between 
POLE3-POLE4 and histones H3-H4. Biochemical analyses establish that POLE3-POLE4 
is a histone chaperone that promotes tetrasome formation and DNA supercoiling 
in vitro. In cells, POLE3-POLE4 binds both newly synthesized and parental 
histones, and its depletion hinders helicase unwinding and chromatin PCNA 
unloading and compromises coordinated parental histone retention and new histone 
deposition. Collectively, our study reveals that POLE3-POLE4 possesses intrinsic 
H3-H4 chaperone activity, which facilitates faithful nucleosome dynamics at the 
replication fork.
