BACKGROUND: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inheritable disease with an increased 
risk of sudden cardiac death. Although several score systems have been proposed, 
the management of children with BrS has been inconsistently described.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics, 
outcome, and risk factors associated with cardiovascular and arrhythmic events 
(AEs) in children younger than 12 years with BrS.
METHODS: In this single-center case series, all children with spontaneous or 
drug/fever-induced type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern and younger 
than 12 years at the time of diagnosis were enrolled.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients younger than 12 years at the time of diagnosis 
were included. The median follow-up was 3.97 years (interquartile range 2-12 
years). In terms of first-degree atrioventricular block, premature beats, 
nonmalignant AEs, malignant AEs, and episodes of syncope, no significant 
differences were observed either between patients with spontaneous and 
drug/fever-induced type 1 Brugada ECG pattern or between female and male 
patients (except a significant difference between female and male patients for 
first-degree atrioventricular block). A higher incidence of malignant AEs was 
observed in patients with syncope (3 of 8 [37.5%] vs 0 of 35 [0%]; P = .005) 
than in patients without syncope. SCN5A mutations were associated with a higher 
occurrence of malignant AEs (3 of 14 [21.4%] vs 0 of 25 [0%]; P = .04) compared 
with no SCN5A mutations.
CONCLUSION: A spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern is not associated with a 
higher incidence of syncope, first-degree atrioventricular block, premature 
beats, nonmalignant AEs, and malignant AEs than the drug/fever-induced type 1 
Brugada ECG pattern. Syncope events are correlated with an increased incidence 
of malignant AEs. Moreover, SCN5A mutations are associated with a higher 
occurrence of malignant AEs.
