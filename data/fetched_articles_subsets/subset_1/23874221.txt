Signaling levels within sensory neurons must be tightly regulated to allow cells 
to integrate information from multiple signaling inputs and to respond to new 
stimuli. Herein we report a new role for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 
in the negative regulation of G protein-coupled nociceptive chemosensory 
signaling. C. elegans lacking EGL-4 function are hypersensitive in their 
behavioral response to low concentrations of the bitter tastant quinine and 
exhibit an elevated calcium flux in the ASH sensory neurons in response to 
quinine. We provide the first direct evidence for cGMP/PKG function in ASH and 
propose that ODR-1, GCY-27, GCY-33 and GCY-34 act in a non-cell-autonomous 
manner to provide cGMP for EGL-4 function in ASH. Our data suggest that 
activated EGL-4 dampens quinine sensitivity via phosphorylation and activation 
of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins RGS-2 and RGS-3, which in 
turn downregulate GÎ± signaling and behavioral sensitivity.
