INTRODUCTION: Clinical trials of direct-acting antivirals for patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis have been conducted, but there is limited information on 
the medicinal applications in clinical settings. We aimed to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for decompensated cirrhotic patients with 
genotypes 1 and 2 in real-world clinical practice.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study of 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was 
conducted for patients with decompensated cirrhosis at 33 institutions.
RESULTS: The cohort included 71 patients (52 genotype 1, 19 genotype 2): 7 with 
Child-Pugh class A, 47 with class B, and 17 with class C (median score 8; range 
5-13). The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score ranged from - 3.01 to - 0.45 (median 
- 1.58). Sixty-nine patients (97.2%) completed treatment as scheduled. The 
overall rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) 
was 94.4% (67/71). SVR12 rates in the patients with Child-Pugh classes A, B, and 
C were 85.7%, 97.9%, and 88.2%, respectively. Among 22 patients with a history 
of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, 20 (90.9%) achieved SVR12. The Child-Pugh 
score and ALBI grade significantly improved after achieving SVR12 
(p = 7.19 × 10-4 and 2.42 × 10-4, respectively). Notably, the use of diuretics 
and branched-chain amino acid preparations significantly reduced after achieving 
SVR12. Adverse events were observed in 19.7% of the patients, leading to 
treatment discontinuation in two patients with cholecystitis and esophageal 
varices rupture, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in real-world clinical 
practice yielded high SVR rates and acceptable safety profiles in decompensated 
cirrhotic patients with genotypes 1 and 2. Achievement of SVR not only restored 
the liver functional reserve but also reduced or spared the administration of 
drugs for related complications.
