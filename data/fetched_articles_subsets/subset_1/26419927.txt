BACKGROUND: Fingolimod (FTY720) is the first sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) 
receptor modulator approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The 
phosphorylated active metabolite FTY720-phosphate (FTY-P) interferes with 
lymphocyte trafficking. In addition, it accumulates in the CNS and reduces brain 
atrophy in multiple sclerosis (MS), and neuroprotective effects are 
hypothesized.
METHODS: Human primary astrocytes as well as human astrocytoma cells were 
stimulated with FTY-P or S1P. We analyzed gene expression by a genome-wide 
microarray and validated induced candidate genes by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 
ELISA. To identify the S1P-receptor subtypes involved, we applied a 
membrane-impermeable S1P analog (dihydro-S1P), receptor subtype specific 
agonists and antagonists, as well as RNAi silencing.
RESULTS: FTY-P induced leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin 11 (IL11), 
and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) mRNA, as well as secretion of 
LIF and IL11 protein. In order to mimic an inflammatory milieu as observed in 
active MS lesions, we combined FTY-P application with tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF). In the presence of this key inflammatory cytokine, FTY-P synergistically 
induced LIF, HBEGF, and IL11 mRNA, as well as secretion of LIF and IL11 protein. 
TNF itself induced inflammatory, B-cell promoting, and antiviral factors 
(CXCL10, BAFF, MX1, and OAS2). Their induction was blocked by FTY-P. After 
continuous exposure of cells to FTY-P or S1P for up to 7 days, the extent of 
induction of neurotrophic factors and the suppression of TNF-induced 
inflammatory genes declined but was still detectable. The induction of 
neurotrophic factors was mediated via surface S1P receptors 1 (S1PR1) and 3 
(S1PR3).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified effects of FTY-P on astrocytes, namely induction of 
neurotrophic mediators (LIF, HBEGF, and IL11) and inhibition of TNF-induced 
inflammatory genes (CXCL10, BAFF, MX1, and OAS2). This supports the view that a 
part of the effects of fingolimod may be mediated via astrocytes.
