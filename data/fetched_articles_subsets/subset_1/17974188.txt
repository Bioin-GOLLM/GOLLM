Maternal thrombophilia (inherited and acquired) has recently been identified as 
a major cause of thrombembolism (TE), but it may also contribute to adverse 
pregnancy outcomes and recurrent pregnancy loss. If the acquired thrombophilia 
is a well-established factor in etiology of fetal loss, the contribution of 
specific inherited thrombophilic genes is still controversial. The most common 
inherited traits are deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S; Factor 
V Leiden; prothrombin G20210A; MTHFR C677T This review focuses on association of 
recurrent fetal loss with specific gene thrombophilic defects. Overall 52% of 
women with obstetric complication other than TE carry thrombophilic gene 
defects. The role of specific genes is different in etiology of early and late 
pregnancy loss. Inherited thrombophilia is now view as multicausal model; 
clinical manifestation can be heterogeneous result of gene-gene and 
gene-environment interactions. Therefore the criteria for genetic screening 
affected women with history of fetal loss should not be very stringent. The 
implication of screening for thrombophilic mutations allow to find women at risk 
of thrombosis and vascular gestational abnormalities in which antithrombotic 
drugs may have potential therapeutic benefit.
