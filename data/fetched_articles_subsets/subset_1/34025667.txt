Tissue-resident macrophages exist in unique environments, or niches, that inform 
their identity and function. There is an emerging body of literature suggesting 
that the qualities of this environment, such as the types of cells and debris 
they eat, the intercellular interactions they form, and the length of time spent 
in residence, collectively what we call habitare, directly inform their 
metabolic state. In turn, a tissue-resident macrophage's metabolic state can 
inform their function, including whether they resolve inflammation and protect 
the host from excessive perturbations of homeostasis. In this review, we 
summarize recent work that seeks to understand the metabolic requirements for 
tissue-resident macrophage identity and maintenance, for how they respond to 
inflammatory challenges, and for how they perform homeostatic functions or 
resolve inflammatory insults. We end with a discussion of the emerging 
technologies that are enabling, or will enable, in situ study of tissue-resident 
macrophage metabolism.
