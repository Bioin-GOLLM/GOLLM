Given the sharp spreading of COVID-19 pandemic all around the world, our 
attention was brought to consider that that many cationic drugs (i.e. those 
characterized by the presence, at physiological pH value, of one or more 
cationic groups, both primary, secondary, tertiary and guanidinic aminic groups) 
could have any effect in impairing SARS-CoV2 entry in the host cell. This could 
open to new therapeutic chances against COVID-19.
