Glutamine utilization promotes enhanced growth of cancer cells. We propose a new 
concept map of cancer metabolism in which mitochondrial NADH and NADPH, in the 
presence of a dysfunctional electron transfer chain, promote reductive 
carboxylation from glutamine. We also discuss why nicotinamide nucleotide 
transhydrogenase (NNT) is required in vivo for glutamine utilization by 
reductive carboxylation. Moreover, NADPH, generated by both the pentose 
phosphate pathway and the cancer-specific serine glycolytic diversion, appears 
to sustain glutamine utilization for amino-acid synthesis, lipid synthesis, and 
for ROS quenching. The fact that the supply of NAD(+) precursors reduces tumor 
aggressiveness suggests experimental approaches to clarify the role of the 
NADH-driven redox network in cancer.
