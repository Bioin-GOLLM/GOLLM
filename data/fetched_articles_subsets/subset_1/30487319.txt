p53, with its family members p63 and p73, have been shown to promote myoblast 
differentiation by regulation of the function of the retinoblastoma protein and 
by direct activation of p21Cip/Waf1 and p57Kip2, promoting cell cycle exit. In 
previous studies, we have demonstrated that the TAp63γ isoform is the only 
member of the p53 family that accumulates during in vitro myoblasts 
differentiation, and that its silencing led to delay in myotube fusion. To 
better dissect the role of TAp63γ in myoblast physiology, we have generated both 
sh-p63 and Tet-On inducible TAp63γ clones. Gene array analysis of sh-p63 C2C7 
clones showed a significant modulation of genes involved in proliferation and 
cellular metabolism. Indeed, we found that sh-p63 C2C7 myoblasts present a 
higher proliferation rate and that, conversely, TAp63γ ectopic expression 
decreases myoblasts proliferation, indicating that TAp63γ specifically 
contributes to myoblasts proliferation, independently of p53 and p73. In 
addition, sh-p63 cells have a defect in mitochondria respiration highlighted by 
a reduction in spare respiratory capacity and a decrease in complex I, IV 
protein levels. These results demonstrated that, beside contributing to cell 
cycle exit, TAp63γ participates to myoblasts metabolism control.
