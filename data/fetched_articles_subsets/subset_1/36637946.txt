BACKGROUND: The mortality rate and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) are well known. A variety of highly malignant human cancers 
express mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 1 (MAD2L1), a transcription factor that 
plays a critical role in their development and progression. However, MAD2L1's 
particular mechanisms and effects on HCC remain uncertain.
METHODS: We performed a pan-cancer analysis for MAD2L1 prognosis and expression 
using The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression data in the present 
study. MAD2L1 may act as an oncogene in HCC, and a combination of in silico 
analyses, including expression, survival, and correlation analyses, were 
performed to identify non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs) that contribute to 
MAD2L1 overexpression.
RESULTS: In conclusion, MAD2L1 is most likely regulated by 
HCP5/miRNA-139-5p/MAD2L1 in HCC based on its upstream ncRNA-related pathway. A 
significant positive association was also found between MAD2L1 levels and tumor 
immune cell infiltration, immune cell biomarkers, and immune checkpoint 
expression.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that ncRNA-mediated upregulation of MAD2L1 
in HCC is closely related to poor prognosis and tumor infiltration.
