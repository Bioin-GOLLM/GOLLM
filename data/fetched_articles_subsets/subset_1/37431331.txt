Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) represents a rare B-cell malignancy with 2% of all 
leukemias and should be differentiated from HCL-like conditions, including 
HCL-variant (HCL-V) and splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL). HCL gets its 
name from the short, thin projections that look like hair on its cells. It is 
associated with a specific immunophenotypic profile, cytopenia, and 
splenomegaly. Spontaneous splenic rupture can be a symptom of hematological 
malignancy such as HCL and is a life-threatening acute emergency. Here, we 
present a case of a 37-year-old man who presented to the hospital with signs of 
acute peritonitis and acute anemia and was found to have atraumatic splenic 
rupture secondary to splenomegaly. He underwent emergent angiography, where the 
bleeding splenic vessel was identified, and the patient was successfully treated 
with embolization. Immunophenotypic profile revealed that B-cells were positive 
for CD11c, CD103, CD25, and CD5, for which he received five days of cladribine 
and achieved complete clinical remission.
