Case. A 33-year-old male nonsmoker presented with sudden onset of dyspnoea and 
thoracic pain. Chest radiograph showed a left-sided pneumothorax. Few days later 
he developed a right-sided pneumothorax. He had a positive family history of 
pneumothorax. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed multiple 
pulmonary cysts predominantly located in the lower lung regions. We suspected 
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD). Conclusion. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare 
autosomal dominant inherited genodermatosis and characterised by clinical 
manifestations including hamartomas of the skin, renal tumors, and pulmonary 
cysts with spontaneous pneumothorax. BHD is probably underdiagnosed because of 
the wide variability in its clinical expression. It is important to recognize 
these patients because of the possibility of developing renal cancer.
