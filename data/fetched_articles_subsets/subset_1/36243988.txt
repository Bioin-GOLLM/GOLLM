A broad range of complex phenotypes are related to dysfunctions in brain 
(hereafter referred to as brain-related traits), including various mental and 
behavioral disorders and diseases of the nervous system. These traits in general 
share overlapping symptoms, pathogenesis, and genetic components. Here, we 
present Brain Catalog (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/braincatalog), a comprehensive 
database aiming to delineate the genetic components of more than 500 GWAS 
summary statistics datasets for brain-related traits from multiple aspects. 
First, Brain Catalog provides results of candidate causal variants, causal 
genes, and functional tissues and cell types for each trait identified by 
multiple methods using comprehensive annotation datasets (58 QTL datasets 
spanning 6 types of QTLs). Second, Brain Catalog estimates the SNP-based 
heritability, the partitioning heritability based on functional annotations, and 
genetic correlations among traits. Finally, through bidirectional Mendelian 
randomization analyses, Brain Catalog presents inference of risk factors that 
are likely causal to each trait. In conclusion, Brain Catalog presents a 
one-stop shop for the genetic components of brain-related traits, potentially 
serving as a valuable resource for worldwide researchers to advance the 
understanding of how GWAS signals may contribute to the biological etiology of 
brain-related traits.
