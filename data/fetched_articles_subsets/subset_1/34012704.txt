Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine is a well-known scaffold in many marketed drugs, such as 
Zolpidem, Minodronic acid, Miroprofen and DS-1 and it also serves as a broadly 
applied pharmacophore in drug discovery. The scaffold revoked a wave of interest 
when Groebke, Blackburn and Bienaymé reported independently a new three 
component reaction resulting in compounds with the imidazo[1,2-a]-heterocycles 
as a core structure. During the course of two decades the Groebke Blackburn 
Bienaymé (GBB-3CR) reaction has emerged as a very important multicomponent 
reaction (MCR), resulting in over a hundred patents and a great number of 
publications in various fields of interest. Now two compounds derived from 
GBB-3CR chemistry received FDA approval. To celebrate the first 20 years of 
GBB-chemistry, we present an overview of the chemistry of the GBB-3CR, including 
an analysis of each of the three starting material classes, solvents and 
catalysts. Additionally, a list of patents and their applications and a more 
in-depth summary of the biological targets that were addressed, including 
structural biology analysis, is given.
