Neurons develop highly stereotyped receptive fields by coordinated growth of 
their dendrites. Although cell surface cues play a major role in this process, 
few dendrite specific signals have been identified to date. We conducted an in 
vivo RNAi screen in Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neurons 
and identified the conserved Ret receptor, known to play a role in axon 
guidance, as an important regulator of dendrite development. The loss of Ret 
results in severe dendrite defects due to loss of extracellular matrix adhesion, 
thus impairing growth within a 2D plane. We provide evidence that Ret interacts 
with integrins to regulate dendrite adhesion via rac1. In addition, Ret is 
required for dendrite stability and normal F-actin distribution suggesting it 
has an essential role in dendrite maintenance. We propose novel functions for 
Ret as a regulator in dendrite patterning and adhesion distinct from its role in 
axon guidance.
