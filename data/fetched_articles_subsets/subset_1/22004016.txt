BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) gene polymorphisms are associated with 
cardiometabolic risk factors, varying in ethnicities. This study aimed to 
investigate such association between the APOC3 -482C>T polymorphism and 
cardiometabolic risk factors in the turkish adult risk factor (TARF) study 
cohort, stratifying by gender and obesity.
METHODS: Randomly selected 1548 individuals (757 male and 791 female, mean age 
49.9Â±11.8 years) were genotyped for -482C>T polymorphism using hybridization 
probes in a Real-Time PCR LC480 device.
RESULTS: The -482TT genotype prevailed 9.9% in men and 11.5% in women. 
Association between 482C>T polymorphism and dyslipidemia (p=0.036, OR=1.42, 
95%Cl=1.02-1.97) was found only in men. Analysis of variance showed that 
anthropometric and metabolic variables were not differently distributed in APOC3 
-482C>T genotypes in the study population. In relation to dyslipidemia and 
obesity, the -482C>T polymorphism showed significant gender-by-genotype 
interactions (p<0.01). When the study population was stratified according to 
gender and obesity, homozygotes for the T allele were associated strongly with 
(by 45%) elevated fasting triglyceride concentrations in obese men (p=0.009) and 
homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index in non-obese women (p=0.013). 
Furthermore, in the same subgroups, the associations of the fasting triglyceride 
concentrations and HOMA index with the TT genotype remained after adjustment for 
risk factors (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: APOC3 -482TT genotype is independently associated with elevated 
fasting triglyceride concentrations in obese men. Presence of obesity seems to 
be required for this genotype to induce markedly elevated triglycerides. 
Furthermore, it is associated with the dyslipidemia in men, without requirement 
of obesity.
