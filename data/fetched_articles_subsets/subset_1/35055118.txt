The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of vitamin D binding 
protein (VDBP, DBP) and its polymorphism in the vitamin D pathway and human 
health. This narrative review shows the latest literature on the most popular 
diseases that have previously been linked to VDBP. Vitamin D plays a crucial 
role in human metabolism, controlling phosphorus and calcium homeostasis. 
Vitamin D binding protein bonds vitamin D and its metabolites and transports 
them to target tissues. The most common polymorphisms in the VDBP gene are 
rs4588 and rs7041, which are located in exon 11 in domain III of the VDBP gene. 
rs4588 and rs7041 may be correlated with differences not only in vitamin D 
status in serum but also with vitamin D metabolites. This review supports the 
role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VDBP gene and presents the 
latest data showing correlations between VDBP variants with important human 
diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and others. In this review, we aim to systematize the 
knowledge regarding the occurrence of diseases and their relationship with 
vitamin D deficiencies, which may be caused by polymorphisms in the VDBP gene. 
Further research is required on the possible influence of SNPs, modifications in 
the structure of the binding protein, and their influence on the organism. It is 
also important to mention that most studies do not have a specific time of year 
to measure accurate vitamin D metabolite levels, which can be misleading in 
conclusions due to the seasonal nature of vitamin D.
