Regional specification is critical for skin development, regeneration, and 
evolution. The contribution of epigenetics in this process remains unknown. 
Here, using avian epidermis, we find two major strategies regulate β-keratin 
gene clusters. (1) Over the body, macro-regional specificities (scales, 
feathers, claws, etc.) established by typical enhancers control five subclusters 
located within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 25; (2) 
within a feather, micro-regional specificities are orchestrated by 
temporospatial chromatin looping of the feather β-keratin gene cluster on 
chromosome 27. Analyses suggest a three-factor model for regional specification: 
competence factors (e.g., AP1) make chromatin accessible, regional specifiers 
(e.g., Zic1) target specific genome regions, and chromatin regulators (e.g., 
CTCF and SATBs) establish looping configurations. Gene perturbations disrupt 
morphogenesis and histo-differentiation. This chicken skin paradigm advances our 
understanding of how regulation of big gene clusters can set up a 
two-dimensional body surface map.
