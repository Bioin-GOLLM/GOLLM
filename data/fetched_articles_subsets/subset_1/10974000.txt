The synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin I has been proposed to serve as a 
Ca(2+) sensor for rapid exocytosis. Synaptotagmin spans the vesicle membrane 
once and possesses a large cytoplasmic domain that contains two C2 domains, C2A 
and C2B. Multiple Ca(2+) ions bind to the membrane proximal C2A domain. However, 
it is not known whether the C2B domain also functions as a Ca(2+)-sensing 
module. Here, we report that Ca(2+) drives conformational changes in the C2B 
domain of synaptotagmin and triggers the homo- and hetero-oligomerization of 
multiple isoforms of the protein. These effects of Ca(2)+ are mediated by a set 
of conserved acidic Ca(2)+ ligands within C2B; neutralization of these residues 
results in constitutive clustering activity. We addressed the function of 
oligomerization using a dominant negative approach. Two distinct reagents that 
block synaptotagmin clustering potently inhibited secretion from semi-intact 
PC12 cells. Together, these data indicate that the Ca(2)+-driven clustering of 
the C2B domain of synaptotagmin is an essential step in excitation-secretion 
coupling. We propose that clustering may regulate the opening or dilation of the 
exocytotic fusion pore.
