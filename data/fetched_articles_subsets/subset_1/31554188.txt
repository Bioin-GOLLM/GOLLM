Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory pilosebaceous condition that affects 
80-90% of adolescents. Since the introduction of tretinoin over 40 years ago, 
topical retinoid products have been a mainstay of acne treatment. The retinoids 
are very effective in addressing multiple aspects of the acne pathology as they 
are comedolytic and anti-inflammatory, and do not contribute to antibiotic 
resistance or microbiome disturbance that can be associated with long-term 
antibiotic therapies that are a common alternative treatment. However, topical 
retinoids are associated with skin dryness, erythema and pain, and may 
exacerbate dermatitis or eczema. Thus, there is a clear need to target delivery 
of the retinoids to the pilosebaceous units to increase efficacy and minimise 
side effects in surrounding skin tissue. This paper reviews the current marketed 
topical retinoid products and the research that has been applied to the 
development of targeted topical delivery systems of retinoids for acne.
