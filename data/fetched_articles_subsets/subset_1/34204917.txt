Metastasis continues to be the primary cause of all cancer-related deaths 
despite the recent advancements in cancer treatments. To evaluate the role of 
mutations in overall survival (OS) and treatment outcomes, we analyzed 957 
metastatic patients with seven major cancer types who had available molecular 
testing results with a FoundationOne CDxÂ® panel. The most prevalent genes with 
somatic mutations were TP53, KRAS, APC, and LRP1B. In this analysis, these genes 
had mutation frequencies higher than in publicly available datasets. We 
identified that the somatic mutations were seven mutually exclusive gene pairs 
and an additional fifty-two co-occurring gene pairs. Mutations in the mutually 
exclusive gene pair APC and CDKN2A showed an opposite effect on the overall 
survival. However, patients with CDKN2A mutations showed significantly shorter 
OS (HR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.34-2.21, p < 0.001) after adjusting for cancer type, age 
at diagnosis, and sex. Five-year post metastatic diagnosis survival analysis 
showed a significant improvement in OS (median survival 28 and 43 months in 
pre-2015 and post-2015 metastatic diagnosis, respectively, p = 0.00021) based on 
the year of metastatic diagnosis. Although the use of targeted therapies after 
metastatic diagnosis prolonged OS, the benefit was not statistically 
significant. However, longer five-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 
significantly associated with targeted therapy use (median 10.9 months (CI: 
9.7-11.9 months) compared to 9.1 months (CI: 8.1-10.1 months) for non-targeted 
therapy, respectively, p = 0.0029). Our results provide a clinically relevant 
overview of the complex molecular landscape and survival mechanisms in 
metastatic solid cancers.
