PURPOSE: Usher syndrome (USH) refers to a group of autosomal recessive disorders 
causing deafness and blindness. The objectives of this study were to determine 
the mutation spectrum in a cohort of Chinese patients with USH and to describe 
the clinical features of the patients with mutations.
METHODS: A total of 119 probands who were clinically diagnosed with USH were 
recruited for genetic analysis. All probands underwent ophthalmic examinations. 
A combination of molecular screening methods, including targeted next-generation 
sequencing, Sanger-DNA sequencing, and multiplex ligation probe amplification 
assay, was used to detect mutations.
RESULTS: We found biallelic mutations in 92 probands (77.3%), monoallelic 
mutations in 5 patients (4.2%), and 1 hemizygous mutation in 1 patient (0.8%), 
resulting in an overall mutation detection rate of 78.2%. Overall, 132 distinct 
disease-causing mutations involving seven USH (ABHD12, CDH23, GPR98, MYO7A, 
PCDH15, USH1C, and USH2A) genes; 5 other retinal degeneration genes (CHM, CNGA1, 
EYS, PDE6B, and TULP1); and 1 nonsyndromic hearing loss gene (MYO15A) were 
identified, and 78 were novel. Mutations of MYOA7 were responsible for 60% of 
USH1 families, followed by PCDH15 (20%) and USH1C (10%). Mutations of USH2A 
accounted for 67.7% of USH2 families, and mutation c.8559-2A>G was the most 
frequent one, accounting for 19.1% of the identified USH2A alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the mutation spectrum for each USH gene in 
Chinese patients differs from those of other populations. The formation of the 
mutation profile for the Chinese population will enable a precise genetic 
diagnosis for USH patients in the future.
