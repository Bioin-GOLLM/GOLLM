Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) are rare, heterogeneous inborn errors of metabolism 
(IEM) diagnosed through a combination of clinical, biochemical, and genetic 
investigations. The aim of this study was molecular characterization of the 
largest cohort of Iranian MPS patients (302 patients from 289 unrelated 
families), along with tracking their ethnicity and geographical origins. 185/289 
patients were studied using an IEM-targeted NGS panel followed by complementary 
Sanger sequencing, which led to the diagnosis of 154 MPS patients and 5 non-MPS 
IEMs (diagnostic yield: 85.9%). Furthermore, 106/289 patients who were referred 
with positive findings went through reanalysis and confirmatory tests which 
confirmed MPS diagnosis in 104. Among the total of 258 MPS patients, 225 were 
homozygous, 90 harbored novel variants, and 9 had copy number variations. MPS IV 
was the most common type (34.8%) followed by MPS I (22.7%) and MPS VI (22.5%). 
Geographical origin analysis unveiled a pattern of distribution for frequent 
variants in ARSB (c.430G>A, c.962T>C [p.Leu321Pro], c.281C>A [p.Ser94*]), GALNS 
(c.319G>A [p.Ala107Thr], c.860C>T [p.Ser287Leu], c.1042A>G [p.Thr348Ala]), and 
IDUA (c.1A>C [p.Met1Leu], c.1598C>G [p.Pro533Arg], c.1562_1563insC 
[p.Gly522Argfs*50]). Our extensive patient cohort reveals the genetic and 
geographic landscape of MPS in Iran, which provides insight into genetic 
epidemiology of MPS and can facilitate a more cost-effective, time-efficient 
diagnostic approach based on the region-specific variants.
