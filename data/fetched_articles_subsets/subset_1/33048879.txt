OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in weight and BMI in adults with HIV-1 at 1 and 2 
years after starting an antiretroviral regimen that included doravirine, 
ritonavir-boosted darunavir, or efavirenz.
DESIGN: Post-hoc analysis of pooled data from three randomized controlled 
trials.
METHODS: We evaluated weight change from baseline, weight gain at least 10%, and 
increase in BMI after 48 and 96 weeks of treatment with doravirine, 
ritonavir-boosted darunavir, or efavirenz-based regimens. Risk factors for 
weight gain and metabolic outcomes associated with weight gain were also 
examined.
RESULTS: Mean (and median) weight changes were similar for doravirine [1.7 
(1.0) kg] and ritonavir-boosted darunavir [1.4 (0.6) kg] and were lower for 
efavirenz [0.6 (0.0) kg] at week 48 but were similar across all treatment groups 
at week 96 [2.4 (1.5), 1.8 (0.7), and 1.6 (1.0) kg, respectively]. No 
significant differences between treatment groups were found in the proportion of 
participants with at least 10% weight gain or the proportion with BMI class 
increase at either time point. Low CD4 T-cell count and high HIV-1 RNA at 
baseline were associated with at least 10% weight gain and BMI class increase at 
both timepoints, but treatment group, age, sex, and race were not.
CONCLUSION: Weight gains over 96 weeks were low in all treatment groups and were 
similar to the average yearly change in adults without HIV-1. Significant weight 
gain and BMI class increase were similar across the treatment groups and were 
predicted by low baseline CD4 T-cell count and high baseline HIV-1 RNA.
