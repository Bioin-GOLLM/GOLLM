The branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder 
characterized by the association of branchial cysts or fistulae, external ear 
malformation and/or preauricular pits, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. 
Mutations in the EYA1 gene on the chromosome band 8q13.3, the human homologue of 
the Drosophila eyes absent (eya) gene, have been identified to be the underlying 
genetic defects of the syndrome. We found a Korean family with BOR syndrome and 
identified a novel insertion mutation (c.1474_1475insC; R492PfsX40) in the EYA1 
gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetically 
confirmed case of BOR syndrome in Korea.
