Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) release interleukin-13 (IL-13) during 
protective immunity to helminth infection and detrimentally during allergy and 
asthma. Using two mouse models to deplete ILC2s in vivo, we demonstrate that T 
helper 2 (Th2) cell responses are impaired in the absence of ILC2s. We show that 
MHCII-expressing ILC2s interact with antigen-specific T cells to instigate a 
dialog in which IL-2 production from T cells promotes ILC2 proliferation and 
IL-13 production. Deletion of MHCII renders IL-13-expressing ILC2s incapable of 
efficiently inducing Nippostrongylus brasiliensis expulsion. Thus, during 
transition to adaptive T cell-mediated immunity, the ILC2 and T cell crosstalk 
contributes to their mutual maintenance, expansion and cytokine production. This 
interaction appears to augment dendritic-cell-induced T cell activation and 
identifies a previously unappreciated pathway in the regulation of type-2 
immunity.
