Thrombin is generated enzymatically from prothrombin by two pathways with the 
intermediates of meizothrombin and prethrombin-2. Experimental concentration 
profiles from two independent groups for these two pathways have been 
re-analyzed. By rationally combining the independent data sets, a simple 
mechanism can be established and rate constants determined. A structural model 
is consistent with the data-derived finding that mechanisms that feature 
channeling or ratcheting are not necessary to describe thrombin production.
