Of the four native nucleosides, 2'-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) is most easily 
oxidized. Two lesions derived from dGuo are 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 
(8-oxodGuo) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (Fapy)∙dGuo. 
Furthermore, while steady-state levels of 8-oxodGuo can be detected in genomic 
DNA, it is also known that 8-oxodGuo is more easily oxidized than dGuo. Thus, 
8-oxodGuo is susceptible to further oxidation to form several hyperoxidized dGuo 
products. This review addresses the structural impact, the mutagenic and 
genotoxic potential, and biological implications of oxidatively damaged DNA, in 
particular 8-oxodGuo, Fapy∙dGuo, and the hyperoxidized dGuo products.
