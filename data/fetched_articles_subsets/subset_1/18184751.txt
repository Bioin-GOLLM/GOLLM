BACKGROUND: Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) is a critical component of the 
energy-sensing mechanism in mammalian cells, and translates physiological 
signals (particularly those induced by exercise) into increased capacity for 
mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation.
OBJECTIVE: To study the possible association between rs2402970, rs6949152 and 
rs10500120 NRF-1 genotypes and several phenotypes indicative of maximum 
(VO(2max)) and submaximum aerobic capacity (ventilatory threshold (VT) and 
metabolic cost of submaximum running at 12 km/hour (running economy; RE)) both 
at baseline and in response to a 18-week endurance training programme in young 
Chinese men of Han origin (n = 102; 19 (SD 1) years).
RESULTS: For rs2402970, a significant genotype effect was seen for VT (p = 
0.004) and RE (p = 0.027). For rs6949152, a significant interaction 
(genotypextraining) effect (p = 0.047) was found for VT.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between NRF-1 genotypes (rs2402970 and 
rs6949152 polymorphisms) and the baseline and/or training response of human 
aerobic capacity. More research is needed to corroborate our data in other 
ethnic groups with lower fitness levels at the pre-training state (particularly 
Caucasians) and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the 
genotype-phenotype associations we found.
