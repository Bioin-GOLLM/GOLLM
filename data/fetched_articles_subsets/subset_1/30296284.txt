BACKGROUND: Human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells are a critical cell 
source for ovarian cancer research; however, they are difficult to obtain and 
maintain under standard laboratory conditions in large quantities. The aim of 
this study was to generate immortalized HOSE (IHOSE) cells with maintained 
properties to the original cell source, thereby guaranteeing a sufficiently 
large cell quantity for ovarian cancer research.
METHODS: HOSE cells isolated from four non-cancer patients and five IHOSE cell 
lines were established by induction of HPV-E6/E7 expression or SV40 large T 
antigen using a lenti-viral system. Each of IHOSE cells was confirmed to be 
distinct by STR profiling. RNA-sequencing was used to compare gene expression 
profiles in HOSE, IHOSE and ovarian cancer cells.
RESULTS: RNA-sequencing results revealed a stronger linear correlation in gene 
expression between IHOSE and HOSE cells (R2 = 0.9288) than between IHOSE or HOSE 
cells and ovarian cancer cells (R2 = 0.8562 and R2 = 0.7982, respectively). The 
gene expression pattern of 319 differentially expressed genes revealed minimal 
differences between HOSE and IHOSE cells, while a strong difference between 
ovarian cancer cells and HOSE or IHOSE cells was observed. Furthermore, the five 
IHOSE cell lines displayed morphological characteristics typical of epithelial 
cells but showed a lower level of EpCAM, CD133 and E-cadherin, as cancer stem 
marker, than ovarian cancer cells. Moreover, unlike cancer cells, IHOSE cells 
could not form colonies in the anchorage-independent soft agar growth assay.
CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that five newly established IHOSE cell 
lines have characteristics of progenitor HOSE cells while exhibiting continuous 
growth, and thus, should be highly useful as control cells for ovarian cancer 
research.
