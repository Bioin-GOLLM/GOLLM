Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) is an autosomal 
dominant vascular disorder that is associated with inherited inactivating 
mutations of the RASA1 gene in the majority of cases. Characteristically, 
patients exhibit one or more focal cutaneous CM that may occur alone or together 
with AVM, arteriovenous fistulas or lymphatic vessel abnormalities. The focal 
nature and varying presentation of lesions has led to the hypothesis that 
somatic "second hit" inactivating mutations of RASA1 are necessary for disease 
development. In this study, we examined CM from four different CM-AVM patients 
for the presence of somatically acquired RASA1 mutations. All four patients were 
shown to possess inactivating heterozygous germline RASA1 mutations. In one of 
the patients, a somatic inactivating RASA1 mutation (c.1534C > T, p.Arg512*) was 
additionally identified in CM lesion tissue. The somatic RASA1 mutation was 
detected within endothelial cells specifically and was in trans with the 
germline RASA1 mutation. Together with the germline RASA1 mutation (c.2125C > T, 
p.Arg709*) in the same patient, the endothelial cell somatic RASA1 mutation 
likely contributed to lesion development. These studies provide the first clear 
evidence of the second hit model of CM-AVM pathogenesis.
