The Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum effector RipE1 is recognized at the plasma 
membrane by NbPtr1, the Nicotiana benthamiana homologue of Pseudomonas tomato 
race 1.

The bacterial wilt disease caused by soilborne bacteria of the Ralstonia 
solanacearum species complex (RSSC) threatens important crops worldwide. Only a 
few immune receptors conferring resistance to this devastating disease are known 
so far. Individual RSSC strains deliver around 70 different type III secretion 
system effectors into host cells to manipulate the plant physiology. RipE1 is an 
effector conserved across the RSSC and triggers immune responses in the model 
solanaceous plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Here, we used multiplexed virus-induced 
gene silencing of the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptor family 
to identify the genetic basis of RipE1 recognition. Specific silencing of the 
N. benthamiana homologue of Solanum lycopersicoides Ptr1 (confers resistance to 
Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato race 1) gene (NbPtr1) completely abolished 
RipE1-induced hypersensitive response and immunity to Ralstonia 
pseudosolanacearum. The expression of the native NbPtr1 coding sequence was 
sufficient to restore RipE1 recognition in Nb-ptr1 knockout plants. 
Interestingly, RipE1 association with the host cell plasma membrane was 
necessary for NbPtr1-dependent recognition. Furthermore, NbPtr1-dependent 
recognition of RipE1 natural variants is polymorphic, providing additional 
evidence for the indirect mode of activation of NbPtr1. Altogether, this work 
supports NbPtr1 relevance for resistance to bacterial wilt disease in 
Solanaceae.
