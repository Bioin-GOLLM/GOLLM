Microglia cells are the unique residential macrophages of the central nervous 
system (CNS). They have a special origin, as they derive from the embryonic yolk 
sac and enter the developing CNS at a very early stage. They play an important 
role during CNS development and adult homeostasis. They have a major 
contribution to adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. Thus, they participate 
in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and contribute to aging. They 
play an important role in sustaining and breaking the blood-brain barrier. As 
innate immune cells, they contribute substantially to the immune response 
against infectious agents affecting the CNS. They play also a major role in the 
growth of tumours of the CNS. Microglia are consequently the key cell population 
linking the nervous and the immune system. This review covers all different 
aspects of microglia biology and pathology in a comprehensive way.
