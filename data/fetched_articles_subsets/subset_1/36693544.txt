Botulinum neurotoxin-producing species of Clostridium are highly diverse. 
Clostridium botulinum could represent at least four different species of 
Clostridium. In addition, strains that do not produce botulinum neurotoxin are 
closely related to toxigenic strains, probably representing the same species. 
Although reclassification of these organisms has been proposed in the past, 
their species names have remained unchanged, mainly because of the premise that 
changing names of medically relevant organisms might cause confusion in the 
healthcare and scientific community. In this review, we discuss the possible 
unintended consequences of reclassifying botulinum neurotoxin-producing species 
of Clostridium, which are of public health, medical, and biodefense interest.
