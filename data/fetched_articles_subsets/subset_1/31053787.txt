Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal-recessive neuromuscular disorder 
representing a continuous spectrum of muscular weakness ranging from compromised 
neonates to adults with minimal manifestations. Patients show homozygous absence 
or disease-causing variants of the SMN1 gene (-/- or 0/0) and in carriers only 
one copy is absent or mutated (1/0). Genetic diagnosis and counseling in SMA 
present several challenges, including the existence of carriers (2/0) that are 
undistinguishable of non-carriers (1/1) with current genetic testing methods and 
the report of patients (0/0) with very mild manifestations and even asymptomatic 
that are discovered when a full symptomatic case appears in the family. Younger 
asymptomatic siblings of symptomatic SMA patients are usually never tested until 
adolescence or adult life. However, following regulatory approval of the first 
tailored treatment for SMA, the prospects for care of these patients have 
changed. Early testing, including pre-symptomatic newborn screening and 
confirmation of diagnosis would change proactive measures and opportunities for 
therapy based in the actual landscape of new treatments. This review discusses 
the challenges and new perspectives of genetic counseling in SMA.
