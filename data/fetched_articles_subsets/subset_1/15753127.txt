Raf kinases relay signals inducing proliferation, differentiation, and survival. 
The Raf-1 isoform has been extensively studied as the upstream kinase linking 
Ras activation to the MEK/ERK module. Recently, however, genetic experiments 
have shown that Raf-1 plays an essential role in counteracting apoptosis, and 
that it does so independently of its ability to activate MEK. By conditional 
gene ablation, we now show that Raf-1 is required for normal wound healing in 
vivo and for the migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. 
Raf-1-deficient cells show a symmetric, contracted appearance, characterized by 
cortical actin bundles and by a disordered vimentin cytoskeleton. These defects 
are due to the hyperactivity and incorrect localization of the Rho-effector 
Rok-alpha to the plasma membrane. Raf-1 physically associates with Rok-alpha in 
wild-type (WT) cells, and reintroduction of either WT or kinase-dead Raf-1 in 
knockout fibroblasts rescues their defects in shape and migration. Thus, Raf-1 
plays an essential, kinase-independent function as a spatial regulator of Rho 
downstream signaling during migration.
