We investigated the lateralization of gut-innervating vagal sensory neurons and 
their roles in feeding behavior. Using genetic, anatomical, and behavioral 
analyses, we discovered a subset of highly lateralized vagal sensory neurons 
with distinct sensory responses to intestinal stimuli. Our results demonstrated 
that left vagal sensory neurons (LNG) are crucial for distension-induced 
satiety, while right vagal sensory neurons (RNG) mediate preference for 
nutritive foods. Furthermore, these lateralized neurons engage different central 
circuits, with LNG neurons recruiting brain regions associated with energy 
balance and RNG neurons activating areas related to salience, memory, and 
reward. Altogether, our findings unveil the diverse roles of asymmetrical 
gut-vagal-brain circuits in feeding behavior, offering new insights for 
potential therapeutic interventions targeting vagal nerve stimulation in 
metabolic and neuropsychiatric diseases.
