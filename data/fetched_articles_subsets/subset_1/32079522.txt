The MAPK (RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK) signaling pathway is a kinase cascade involved in 
the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in response 
to external stimuli. The V600E mutation in the BRAF gene has been detected in 
various tumors, resulting in a 500-fold increase in BRAF kinase activity. 
However, monotherapy with selective BRAF V600E inhibitors often leads to 
reactivation of MAPK signaling cascade and emergence of drug resistance. 
Therefore, new targets are being developed for the inhibition of components of 
the aberrantly activated cascade. It was recently discovered that resistance to 
BRAF V600E inhibitors may be associated with the activity of the tyrosine 
phosphatase SHP-2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene. In this paper, we analyzed 
transcriptional effects of PTPN11 gene knockdown and selective suppression of 
BRAF V600E in a model of thyroid follicular epithelium. We found that the 
siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTPN11 after vemurafenib treatment prevented an 
increase in the expression CCNA1 and NOTCH4 genes involved in the formation of 
drug resistance of tumors. On the other hand, downregulation of PTPN11 
expression blocked the transcriptional activation of genes (p21, p15, p16, RB1, 
and IGFBP7) involved in cell cycle regulation and oncogene-induced senescence in 
response to BRAF V600E expression. Therefore, it can be assumed that SHP-2 
participates not only in emergence of drug resistance in cancer cells, but also 
in oncogene-induced cell senescence.
