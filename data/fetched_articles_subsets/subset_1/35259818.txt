The neuropsychiatric disease named obsessive-compulsive disorder is composed by 
obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessive-compulsive disorder etiologies are 
undefined. However, numerous mechanisms in several localizations are implicated. 
Some studies showed that both glutamate, inflammatory factors and oxidative 
stress could have main functions in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Glycogen 
synthase kinase-3β, the major negative controller of the WNT/β-catenin pathway 
is upregulated in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, some studies presented the actions of the different circadian clock 
genes. WNT/β-catenin pathway and circadian clock genes appear to be intricate. 
Thus, this review focuses on the interaction between circadian clock genes and 
the WNT/β-catenin pathway in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
