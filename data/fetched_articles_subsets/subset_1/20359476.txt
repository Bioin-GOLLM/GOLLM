SOST is a negative regulator of bone formation, and mutations in human SOST are 
responsible for sclerosteosis. In addition to high bone mass, sclerosteosis 
patients occasionally display hand defects, suggesting that SOST may function 
embryonically. Here we report that overexpression of SOST leads to loss of 
posterior structures of the zeugopod and autopod by perturbing 
anterior-posterior and proximal-distal signaling centers in the developing limb. 
Mutant mice that overexpress SOST in combination with Grem1 and Lrp6 mutations 
display more severe limb defects than single mutants alone, while Sost(-/-) 
significantly rescues the Lrp6(-/-) skeletal phenotype, signifying that SOST 
gain-of-function impairs limb patterning by inhibiting the WNT signaling through 
LRP5/6.
