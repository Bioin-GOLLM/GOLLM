Many secretory enzymes acquire essential zinc ions (Zn2+) in the Golgi complex. 
ERp44, a chaperone operating in the early secretory pathway, also binds Zn2+ to 
regulate its client binding and release for the control of protein traffic and 
homeostasis. Notably, three membrane transporter complexes, ZnT4, ZnT5/ZnT6 and 
ZnT7, import Zn2+ into the Golgi lumen in exchange with protons. To identify 
their specific roles, we here perform quantitative Zn2+ imaging using 
super-resolution microscopy and Zn2+-probes targeted in specific Golgi 
subregions. Systematic ZnT-knockdowns reveal that ZnT4, ZnT5/ZnT6 and ZnT7 
regulate labile Zn2+ concentration at the distal, medial, and proximal Golgi, 
respectively, consistent with their localization. Time-course imaging of cells 
undergoing synchronized secretory protein traffic and functional assays 
demonstrates that ZnT-mediated Zn2+ fluxes tune the localization, trafficking, 
and client-retrieval activity of ERp44. Altogether, this study provides deep 
mechanistic insights into how ZnTs control Zn2+ homeostasis and ERp44-mediated 
proteostasis along the early secretory pathway.
