BACKGROUND: The poultry industry suffers losses from problems as pale, soft and 
exudative (PSE), and dark, firm and dry (DFD) meat can develop in meat as a 
result of short- and long-term stress, respectively. These abnormalities are 
impacted by pre-slaughter animal welfare.
METHODS: This work evaluated the effects of open vehicle container microclimate, 
throughout the 38 ± 10 km journey from the farm to the slaughterhouse, on 
commercially turkey transported during the Brazilian winter season. The journey 
was initiated immediately after water bath in truck fitted with portable Kestrel 
anemometers to measure air ventilation, relative humidity, temperature and 
ventilation.
RESULTS: The inferior compartments of the middle and rear truck regions showed 
highest temperature and relative humidity, and lower air ventilation. In 
addition, the superior compartments of the front truck regions presented lower 
temperature and wind chill, and highest air ventilation. The breast meat samples 
from animals located at the inferior compartments of the middle and rear truck 
regions and subjected to with water bath (WiB) treatment presented highest 
DFD-like and had lowest PSE-like meat incidence than those from animals located 
at other compartments within the container. Lower incidence of PSE-like meat was 
observed in birds without water bath (WoB).
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment on turkeys transported under Brazilian southern winter 
conditions revealed that breast meat quality can be affected by relative 
humidity, air ventilation, temperature, and transport under subtropical 
conditions promoting color abnormalities and the formation of simultaneously 
PSE-like and DFD-like meat.
