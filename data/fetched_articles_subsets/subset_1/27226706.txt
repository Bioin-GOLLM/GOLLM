RECK is downregulated in many tumors, and forced RECK expression in tumor cells 
often results in suppression of malignant phenotypes. Recent findings suggest 
that RECK is upregulated after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal 
epithelium-derived cells but not in cancer cells. Since several microRNAs (miRs) 
are known to target RECK mRNA, we hypothesized that certain miR(s) may be 
involved in this suppression of RECK upregulation after EMT in cancer cells. To 
test this hypothesis, we used three approaches: (1) text mining to find miRs 
relevant to EMT in cancer cells, (2) predicting miR targets using four 
algorithms, and (3) comparing miR-seq data and RECK mRNA data using a novel 
non-parametric method. These approaches identified the miR-183-96-182 cluster as 
a strong candidate. We also looked for transcription factors and signaling 
molecules that may promote cancer EMT, miR-183-96-182 upregulation, and RECK 
downregulation. Here we describe our methods, findings, and a testable 
hypothesis on how RECK expression could be regulated in cancer cells after EMT.
