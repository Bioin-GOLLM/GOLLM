In 2018, an international Task Force formulated recommendations for treating 
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) to target. The Task Force has not yet 
resolved three issues. The first issue is the lack of a single "best" target. 
The Task Force decided not to recommend the use of a specific instrument to 
assess inactive disease or remission. Recent studies underscore the use of a 
broad target definition. The second issue is the basic assumption that a 
treatment aggressively aimed at the target will have 'domino effects' on other 
treatment goals as well. Thus far, this assumption was not confirmed for pain, 
fatigue and stiffness. The third issue is shared decision-making, and the role 
of individual patient targets. Nowadays, patients and parents should have a more 
active role in choosing targets and their personal treatment goals. In our 
department the electronic medical records have been restructured in such a way 
that the patient's personal treatment goals with a target date appears on the 
front page. The visualization of their specific personal goals helps us to have 
meaningful discussions on the individualized treatment strategy and to share 
decisions. In conclusion, a joint treat to target (T2T) strategy is a promising 
approach for JIA. The Task Force formulated valuable overarching principles and 
a first version of recommendations. However, implementation of T2T needs to 
capture more than just inactive disease. Patients and parents should have an 
active role in choosing personal targets as well.
