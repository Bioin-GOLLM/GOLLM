Since the introduction of glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy, congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is no longer a fatal disease. The development of 
neonatal screening programs and the amelioration of GC treatment strategies have 
improved significantly life expectancy in CAH patients. Thanks to these 
achievements, CAH patients are now in their adulthood, but an increased 
incidence of cardiovascular risk factors has been reported compared to general 
population in this stage of life. The aim of CAH treatment is to both prevent 
adrenal insufficiency and suppress androgen excess; in this delicate balance, 
under- as well as overtreatment might be equally harmful to long-term 
cardiovascular health. This work examines the prevalence of metabolic features 
and cardiovascular events, their correlation with hormone levels and GC 
replacement regimen in CAH patients and focuses on precocious markers to early 
detect patients at higher risk and new potential treatment approaches.
