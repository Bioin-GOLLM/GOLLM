Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated 
gene 5 (MDA5) are essential for detecting viral RNA and triggering antiviral 
responses, including production of type I interferon. We analyzed the phenotype 
of non-synonymous mutants of human RIG-I and MDA5 reported in databases by 
functional complementation in cell cultures. Of seven missense mutations of 
RIG-I, S183I, which occurs within the second caspase recruitment domain repeat, 
inactivated this domain and conferred a dominant inhibitory function. Of 10 
mutants of MDA5, two exhibited loss of function. A nonsense mutation, E627*, 
resulted in deletion of the C-terminal region and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 
binding activity. Another loss of function mutation, I923V, which occurs within 
the C-terminal domain, did not affect dsRNA binding activity, suggesting a novel 
and essential role for this residue in the signaling. Remarkably, these 
mutations are implicated in resistance to type I diabetes. However, the A946T 
mutation of MDA5, which has been implicated in type I diabetes by previous 
genetic analyses, affected neither dsRNA binding nor IFN gene activation. These 
results provide new insights into the structure-function relationship of 
RIG-I-like receptors as well as into human RIG-I-like receptor polymorphisms, 
antiviral innate immunity, and autoimmune diseases.
