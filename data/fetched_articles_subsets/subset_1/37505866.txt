The thymus is an essential component of maternal immune systems that play key 
roles in recognizing the placenta as immunologically foreign. The inhibitor of 
the NF-κB (IκB) family has essential effects on the NF-κB pathway; however, it 
is unclear whether early pregnancy modulates the expression of the IκB family in 
the thymus. In this study, maternal thymuses were sampled on day 16 of 
nonpregnancy and different gestation stages in the ovine, and the expression of 
IκB proteins was analyzed. The data showed that B cell leukemia-3 and IκBβ 
increased; however, IκBα, IκBε, and IKKγ deceased during gestation. Furthermore, 
there was an increase in IκBNS and IκBζ expression values on day 13 of 
pregnancy; however, this decreased on day 25 of gestation. In summary, the 
expression of the IκB family was modulated in the thymus during early gestation, 
suggesting that the maternal thymus can be associated with maternal immunologic 
tolerance and pregnancy establishment in ewes.
