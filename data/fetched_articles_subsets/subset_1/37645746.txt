The direct causes of neurodegeneration underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
many other dementias, are not known. Here we identify serum amyloid P component 
(SAP), a constitutive plasma protein normally excluded from the brain, as a 
potential drug target. After meta-analysis of three genome-wide association 
studies, comprising 44,288 participants, cis-Mendelian randomization showed that 
genes responsible for higher plasma SAP values are significantly associated with 
AD, Lewy body dementia and plasma tau concentration. These genetic findings are 
consistent with experimental evidence of SAP neurotoxicity and the strong, 
independent association of neocortex SAP content with dementia at death. 
Depletion of SAP from the blood and from the brain, as is provided by the safe, 
well tolerated, experimental drug, miridesap, may therefore contribute to 
treatment of neurodegeneration.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interests: AFS and CF have received 
funding from NewAmsterdam Pharma for unrelated work. MBP is the inventor on 
expired patents on SAP depletion by miridesap (CPHPC). GlaxoSmithKlineâ€™s 
abandoned patents on an experimental miridesap prodrug are assigned to UCL 
spinout company, Pentraxin Therapeutics Ltd, founded and directed by MBP. The 
other authors have no competing interests.
