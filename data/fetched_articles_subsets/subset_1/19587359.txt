OBJECTIVE: Common variants in FTO (the fat mass- and obesity-associated gene) 
associate with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The regulation and biological 
function of FTO mRNA expression in target tissue is unknown. We investigated the 
genetic and nongenetic regulation of FTO mRNA in skeletal muscle and adipose 
tissue and their influence on in vivo glucose and fat metabolism.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was genotyped in two 
twin cohorts: 1) 298 elderly twins aged 62-83 years with glucose tolerance 
ranging from normal to type 2 diabetes and 2) 196 young (25-32 years) and 
elderly (58-66 years) nondiabetic twins examined by a 
hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp including indirect calorimetry. FTO mRNA 
expression was determined in subcutaneous adipose tissue (n = 226) and skeletal 
muscle biopsies (n = 158).
RESULTS: Heritability of FTO expression in both tissues was low, and FTO 
expression was not influenced by FTO rs9939609 genotype. FTO mRNA expression in 
skeletal muscle was regulated by age and sex, whereas age and BMI were 
predictors of adipose tissue FTO mRNA expression. FTO mRNA expression in adipose 
tissue was associated with an atherogenic lipid profile. In skeletal muscle, FTO 
mRNA expression was negatively associated to fat and positively to glucose 
oxidation rates as well as positively correlated with expression of genes 
involved in oxidative phosphorylation including PGC1alpha.
CONCLUSIONS: The heritability of FTO expression in adipose tissue and skeletal 
muscle is low and not influenced by obesity-associated FTO genotype. The 
age-dependent decline in FTO expression is associated with peripheral defects of 
glucose and fat metabolism.
