PURPOSE: In this prospective study, we evaluated the association between the 
serum levels of antioxidants uric acid (UA), albumin, and total bilirubin and 
the risk of cancer in a Korean population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15882 subjects were followed up for cancer 
development and cancer-related death. During the follow-up period, 1619 cancer 
diagnoses and 617 cancer-related deaths were recorded. Cox proportional 
regression was performed to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) per standard 
deviation (SD) increment and 95% confidence interval (CI). The model was 
adjusted for covariates such as the age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, 
physical activity, education level, body mass index, and family history. 
Sensitivity analyses using the study subjects with physiological serum levels of 
each indicator were also performed.
RESULTS: UA levels were positively correlated with cancer risk (HR per SD 
increment 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09), and albumin levels were inversely associated 
with the overall cancer risk (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) and cancer-related 
death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93). Total bilirubin levels were negatively 
correlated with the risk of cancer-related death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99). 
By cancer type, UA was positively associated with prostate cancer, total 
bilirubin was positively associated with liver cancer, and albumin was inversely 
associated with lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the role of antioxidants in 
carcinogenesis. Future large-cohort studies are needed to confirm the predictive 
value of albumin, UA, and total bilirubin levels in each type of cancer.
