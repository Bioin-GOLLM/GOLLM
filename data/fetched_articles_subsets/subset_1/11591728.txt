The plasma membrane calcium/calmodulin-dependent calcium ATPase (PMCA) (Shull, 
G.E., and J. Greeb. 1988. J. Biol. Chem. 263:8646-8657; Verma, A.K., A.G. 
Filoteo, D.R. Stanford, E.D. Wieben, J.T. Penniston, E.E. Strehler, R. Fischer, 
R. Heim, G. Vogel, S. Mathews, et al. 1988. J. Biol. Chem. 263:14152-14159; 
Carafoli, E. 1997. Basic Res. Cardiol. 92:59-61) has been proposed to be a 
regulator of calcium homeostasis and signal transduction networks of the cell. 
However, little is known about its precise mechanisms of action. Knock-out of 
(mainly neuronal) isoform 2 of the enzyme resulted in hearing loss and balance 
deficits due to severe inner ear defects, affecting formation and maintenance of 
otoconia (Kozel, P.J., R.A. Friedman, L.C. Erway, E.N. Yamoah, L.H. Liu, T. 
Riddle, J.J. Duffy, T. Doetschman, M.L. Miller, E.L. Cardell, and G.E. Shull. 
1998. J. Biol. Chem. 273:18693-18696). Here we demonstrate that PMCA 4b is a 
negative regulator of nitric oxide synthase I (NOS-I, nNOS) in HEK293 embryonic 
kidney and neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell models. Binding of PMCA 4b to NOS-I was 
mediated by interaction of the COOH-terminal amino acids of PMCA 4b and the PDZ 
domain of NOS-I (PDZ: PSD 95/Dlg/ZO-1 protein domain). Increasing expression of 
wild-type PMCA 4b (but not PMCA mutants unable to bind PDZ domains or devoid of 
Ca2+-transporting activity) dramatically downregulated NO synthesis from 
wild-type NOS-I. A NOS-I mutant lacking the PDZ domain was not regulated by 
PMCA, demonstrating the specific nature of the PMCA-NOS-I interaction. 
Elucidation of PMCA as an interaction partner and major regulator of NOS-I 
provides evidence for a new dimension of integration between calcium and NO 
signaling pathways.
