BACKGROUND: TANGO2 deficiency disorder (TDD) is an autosomal recessive disease 
associated with metabolic crisis, lethal cardiac arrhythmias, and 
cardiomyopathy. Data regarding treatment, management, and outcomes of cardiac 
manifestations of TDD are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe TDD-related cardiac crises.
METHODS: Retrospective multicenter chart review was made of TDD patients 
admitted with cardiac crises, defined as development of ventricular tachycardia 
(VT), cardiomyopathy, or cardiac arrest during metabolic crises.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven children were admitted for 43 cardiac crises (median age 
6.4 years; interquartile range [IQR] 2.4-9.8 years) at 14 centers. During 
crisis, QTc prolongation occurred in all (median 547 ms; IQR 504-600 ms) and a 
type I Brugada pattern in 8 (26%). Arrhythmias included VT in 21 (78%), 
supraventricular tachycardia in 3 (11%), and heart block in 1 (4%). Nineteen 
patients (70%) developed cardiomyopathy, and 20 (74%) experienced a cardiac 
arrest. There were 10 deaths (37%), 6 related to arrhythmias. In 5 patients, 
recalcitrant VT occurred despite use of antiarrhythmic drugs. In 6 patients, 
arrhythmias were controlled after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 
support; 5 of these patients survived. Among 10 patients who survived VT without 
ECMO, successful treatment included intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, and 
atrial pacing in multiple cases and verapamil in 1 patient. Initiation of feeds 
seemed to decrease VT events.
CONCLUSION: TDD-related cardiac crises are associated with a high risk of 
arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and death. Although further studies 
are needed, early recognition and appropriate treatment are critical. Acutely, 
intravenous magnesium, isoproterenol, atrial pacing, and ECMO as a last resort 
seem to be the best current treatment options, and early initiation of feeds may 
prevent VT events.
