We tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet 
activation by plasmin is mediated via the enzymatic action of plasmin on the 
functional thrombin receptor. We monitored the binding of the anti-thrombin 
receptor antibody [anti-TR-(34-46)] to platelets; this binding is sensitive to 
the cleavage of the thrombin receptor at amino acid residues Arg-41 to Ser-42. 
Plasmin inhibited anti-TR-(34-46) binding in dose- and time-dependent manners. 
The inactive synthetic peptide with the amino acid sequence 40-55 of the 
thrombin receptor (D-FPRSFLLRNPNDKYEPF) was similarly cleaved by thrombin and 
plasmin to an active peptide (SFLLRNPNDKYEPF) that produced robust cytosolic 
Ca2+ responses. At high concentrations, plasmin itself can activate platelets. 
We explored this effect with the use of anti-TR-(1-160). This antibody abolished 
the cytosolic Ca2+ responses to thrombin and to the thrombin receptor-activating 
peptide SFLLRN but did not attenuate the plasmin-induced cytosolic Ca2+ 
response. Thus plasmin inhibits thrombin-evoked platelet activation by cleaving 
the thrombin receptor, but the plasmin-induced cytosolic Ca2+ response is not 
due to the generation of the tethered peptide of the thrombin receptor.
