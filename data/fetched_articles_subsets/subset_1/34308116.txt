OBJECTIVES: There is limited published literature on the genetic risks of 
chronic inflammatory related disease (eg, obesity and cardiovascular disease) 
among the Central Asia population. The aim is to determine potential genetic 
loci as risk factors for obesity for the Kazakhstani population.
SETTING: Kazakhstan.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty-three Kazakhstani nationals (ethnic groups: 
both Russians and Kazakhs) were recruited for the cross-sectional study. Linear 
regression models, adjusted for confounding factors, were used to examine the 
genetic associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 genetic 
loci with obesity (73 obese/overweight individuals and 90 controls).
RESULTS: Overall, logistic regression analyses revealed genotypes C/T in CRP 
(rs1205), A/C in AGTR1 (rs5186), A/G in CBS (rs234706), G/G in FUT2 (rs602662), 
A/G in PAI-1 (rs1799889), G/T (rs1801131) and A/G (rs1801133) in MTHFR genes 
significantly decrease risk of overweight/obesity. After stratification for 
ethnicity, rs234706 was significantly associated with overweight/obesity in both 
Russians and Kazakhs, while rs1800871 was significant in Kazakhs only.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that variations in SNPs known to be associated 
with cardiovascular health can also contribute to the risks of developing 
obesity in the population of Kazakhstan.
