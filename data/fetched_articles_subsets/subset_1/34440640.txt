Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and 
results in severe neurodegeneration and progressive cognitive decline. 
Neurotrophins are growth factors involved in the development and survival of 
neurons, but also in underlying mechanisms for memory formation such as 
hippocampal long-term potentiation. Our aim was to identify small molecules with 
stimulatory effects on the signaling of two neurotrophins, the nerve growth 
factor (NGF) and the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To identify 
molecules that could potentiate neurotrophin signaling, 25,000 molecules were 
screened, which led to the identification of the triazinetrione derivatives 
ACD855 (Ponazuril) and later on ACD856, as positive allosteric modulators of 
tropomyosin related kinase (Trk) receptors. ACD855 or ACD856 potentiated the 
cellular signaling of the neurotrophin receptors with EC50 values of 1.9 and 3.2 
or 0.38 and 0.30 µM, respectively, for TrkA or TrkB. ACD855 increased 
acetylcholine levels in the hippocampus by 40% and facilitated long term 
potentiation in rat brain slices. The compounds acted as cognitive enhancers in 
a TrkB-dependent manner in several different behavioral models. Finally, the 
age-induced cognitive dysfunction in 18-month-old mice could be restored to the 
same level as found in 2-month-old mice after a single treatment of ACD856. We 
have identified a novel mechanism to modulate the activity of the Trk-receptors. 
The identification of the positive allosteric modulators of the Trk-receptors 
might have implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's diseases and other 
diseases characterized by cognitive impairment.
