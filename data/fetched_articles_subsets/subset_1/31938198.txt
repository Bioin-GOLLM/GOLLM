Objective: To investigate whether features of lung cancer in young patients 
differ from those of elderly patients. Method: A retrospective analysis was made 
to compare clinicopathological and molecular characteristics between 272 young 
patients under 40 years old (young Group) with lung cancer and 167 elderly 
patients over 60 years old (elderly group). Results: The young group had 
significantly higher proportions of females, adenocarcinoma, and were well 
differentiated, without lymph node metastasis, and were of lower clinical stage 
as compared with the elderly group (P<0.05). The positive rate of ALK in the 
young group was significantly higher than in the elderly group (17.01% vs. 
4.17%, P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the mutation 
rate of EGFR and ROS1 in two groups. However, the distribution of EGFR mutation 
sub-types in the two groups was significantly different, with the proportion of 
19del in the young group being significantly higher than that in the elderly 
group. Conclusions: The young patients with lung cancer have distinct features 
compared with elderly patients, and may have different mechanisms of 
tumorigenesis.
