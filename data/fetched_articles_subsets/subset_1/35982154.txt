Repeated exposure to opioids causes tolerance, which limits their analgesic 
utility and contributes to overdose and abuse liability. However, the molecular 
mechanisms underpinning tolerance are not well understood. Here, we used a 
forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for unbiased identification of 
genes regulating opioid tolerance which revealed a role for PTR-25/Ptchd1. We 
found that PTR-25/Ptchd1 controls μ-opioid receptor trafficking and that these 
effects were mediated by the ability of PTR-25/Ptchd1 to control membrane 
cholesterol content. Electrophysiological studies showed that loss of Ptchd1 in 
mice reduced opioid-induced desensitization of neurons in several brain regions 
and the peripheral nervous system. Mice and C. elegans lacking Ptchd1/PTR-25 
display similarly augmented responses to opioids. Ptchd1 knockout mice fail to 
develop analgesic tolerance and have greatly diminished somatic withdrawal. 
Thus, we propose that Ptchd1 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in 
protecting the μ-opioid receptor against overstimulation.
