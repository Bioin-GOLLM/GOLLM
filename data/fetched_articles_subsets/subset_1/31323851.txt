Single-chain Fv (scFv) antibodies are recombinant proteins in which the variable 
regions of the heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) are connected by a short 
flexible polypeptide linker. ScFvs have the advantages of easy genetic 
manipulation and low-cost production using Escherichia coli compared with 
monoclonal antibodies, and are thus expected to be utilized as next-generation 
medical antibodies. However, the practical use of scFvs has been limited due to 
low homogeneity caused by their aggregation propensity mediated by inter-chain 
VH-VL interactions. Because the interactions between the VH and VL domains of 
antibodies are generally weak, individual scFvs are assumed to be in equilibrium 
between a closed state and an open state, in which the VH and VL domains are 
assembled and disassembled, respectively. This dynamic feature of scFvs triggers 
the formation of dimer, trimer, and larger aggregates caused by the inter-chain 
VH-VL interactions. To overcome this problem, the N-terminus and C-terminus were 
herein connected by sortase A-mediated ligation to produce a cyclic scFv. 
Open-closed dynamics and aggregation were markedly suppressed in the cyclic 
scFv, as judged from dynamic light scattering and high-speed atomic force 
microscopy analyses. Surface plasmon resonance and differential scanning 
fluorometry analysis revealed that neither the affinity for antigen nor the 
thermal stability was disrupted by the scFv cyclization. Generality was 
confirmed by applying the present method to several scFv proteins. Based on 
these results, cyclic scFvs are expected to be widely utilized in industrial and 
therapeutic applications.
