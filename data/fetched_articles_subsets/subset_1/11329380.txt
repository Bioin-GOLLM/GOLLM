end13-1 was isolated in a screen for endocytosis mutants and has been shown to 
have a post-internalisation defect in endocytic transport as well as a defect in 
vacuolar protein sorting (Vps(-) phenotype), leading to secretion of newly 
synthesised vacuolar proteins. Here we demonstrate that END13 is identical to 
VPS4, encoding an AAA (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular 
activities)-family ATPase. We also report that the end13-1 mutation is a serine 
335 to phenylalanine substitution in the AAA-ATPase domain of End13p/Vps4p. It 
has been reported that mutant cells lacking End13p/Vps4p (end13(vps4)Delta) 
accumulate endocytosed marker dyes, plasma membrane receptors and newly 
synthesised vacuolar hydrolase precursors in an endosomal compartment adjacent 
to the vacuole (prevacuolar compartment, or PVC). We find, however, that the 
end13 mutants have defects in transport of endocytosed fluorescent dyes, plasma 
membrane receptors and ligands from small peripherally located early endosomes 
to larger late endosomes, which are often located adjacent to the vacuole. Our 
results indicate that End13p/Vps4p may play an important role in multiple steps 
of membrane traffic through the endocytic pathway.
