A 6-coumarin diazonium salt was synthesized and tested on Torpedo 
acetylcholinesterase as a site-directed irreversible probe for quaternary 
ammonium binding. The rate of the inactivation was examined as a function of 
time, inhibitor concentration, and pH, which allowed the determination of the 
dissociation and the rate constants of this efficient affinity labeling process. 
Protection experiments using tetramethylammonium, edrophonium, and propidium 
demonstrated that the labeling reaction occurred exclusively at the peripheral 
quaternary ammonium binding site of the enzyme. This result was confirmed by the 
modification of propidium binding at the peripheral site after inactivation 
reaction, as directly determined by fluorescence. Mutations of the likely 
labeled amino acid residues, Tyr70 and Tyr121, by histidine and phenylalanine 
indicated a predominant involvement of Tyr70 over Tyr121 in the coupling 
reaction.
