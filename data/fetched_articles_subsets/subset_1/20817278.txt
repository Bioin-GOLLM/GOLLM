Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is complicated by pro-oxidant intraneuronal Fe(2+) 
elevation as well as extracellular Zn(2+) accumulation within amyloid plaque. We 
found that the AD β-amyloid protein precursor (APP) possesses ferroxidase 
activity mediated by a conserved H-ferritin-like active site, which is inhibited 
specifically by Zn(2+). Like ceruloplasmin, APP catalytically oxidizes Fe(2+), 
loads Fe(3+) into transferrin, and has a major interaction with ferroportin in 
HEK293T cells (that lack ceruloplasmin) and in human cortical tissue. Ablation 
of APP in HEK293T cells and primary neurons induces marked iron retention, 
whereas increasing APP695 promotes iron export. Unlike normal mice, APP(-/-) 
mice are vulnerable to dietary iron exposure, which causes Fe(2+) accumulation 
and oxidative stress in cortical neurons. Paralleling iron accumulation, APP 
ferroxidase activity in AD postmortem neocortex is inhibited by endogenous 
Zn(2+), which we demonstrate can originate from Zn(2+)-laden amyloid aggregates 
and correlates with Aβ burden. Abnormal exchange of cortical zinc may link 
amyloid pathology with neuronal iron accumulation in AD.
