RATIONALE: The class Ic antiarrhythmic drug flecainide prevents ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia (CPVT), a disease caused by hyperactive RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine 
receptor) mediated calcium (Ca) release. Although flecainide inhibits single 
RyR2 channels in vitro, reports have claimed that RyR2 inhibition by flecainide 
is not relevant for its mechanism of antiarrhythmic action and concluded that 
sodium channel block alone is responsible for flecainide's efficacy in CPVT.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether RyR2 block independently contributes to 
flecainide's efficacy for suppressing spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 
release and for preventing ventricular tachycardia in vivo.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We synthesized N-methylated flecainide analogues 
(QX-flecainide and N-methyl flecainide) and showed that N-methylation reduces 
flecainide's inhibitory potency on RyR2 channels incorporated into artificial 
lipid bilayers. N-methylation did not alter flecainide's inhibitory activity on 
human cardiac sodium channels expressed in HEK293T cells. Antiarrhythmic 
efficacy was tested utilizing a Casq2 (cardiac calsequestrin) knockout 
(Casq2-/-) CPVT mouse model. In membrane-permeabilized Casq2-/- 
cardiomyocytes-lacking intact sarcolemma and devoid of sodium channel 
contribution-flecainide, but not its analogues, suppressed RyR2-mediated Ca 
release at clinically relevant concentrations. In voltage-clamped, intact 
Casq2-/- cardiomyocytes pretreated with tetrodotoxin to inhibit sodium channels 
and isolate the effect of flecainide on RyR2, flecainide significantly reduced 
the frequency of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca release, while 
QX-flecainide and N-methyl flecainide did not. In vivo, flecainide effectively 
suppressed catecholamine-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in Casq2-/- mice, 
whereas N-methyl flecainide had no significant effect on arrhythmia burden, 
despite comparable sodium channel block.
CONCLUSIONS: Flecainide remains an effective inhibitor of RyR2-mediated 
arrhythmogenic Ca release even when cardiac sodium channels are blocked. In mice 
with CPVT, sodium channel block alone did not prevent ventricular tachycardia. 
Hence, RyR2 channel inhibition likely constitutes the principal mechanism of 
antiarrhythmic action of flecainide in CPVT.
