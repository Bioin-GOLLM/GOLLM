BACKGROUND: While mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been exceedingly 
effective in preventing symptomatic viral infection, the features of immune 
response remain to be clarified.
METHODS: In the present prospective observational study, 225 healthy individuals 
in Kumamoto General Hospital, Japan, who received two BNT162b2 doses in February 
2021, were enrolled. Correlates of BNT162b2-elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing 
activity (50% neutralization titer: NT 50 ; assessed using infectious virions 
and live target cells) with SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding-IgG and -IgM levels, adverse 
effects (AEs), ages, and genders were examined. The average half-life of 
neutralizing activity and the average time length for the loss of detectable 
neutralizing activity were determined and the potency of serums against variants 
of concerns was also determined.
FINDINGS: Significant rise in NT 50 s was seen in serums on day 28 post-1st 
dose. A moderate inverse correlation was seen between NT 50 s and ages, but no 
correlation was seen between NT 50 s and AEs. NT 50 s and IgG levels on day 28 
post-1st dose and pain scores following the 2nd shot were greater in women than 
in men. The average half-life of neutralizing activity in the vaccinees was 
approximately 67.8 days and the average time length for their serums to lose the 
detectable neutralizing activity was 198.3 days. While serums from 
elite-responders (NT 50 s>1,500-fold: the top 4% among all participants' NT 50 
s) potently to moderately blocked the infectivity of variants of concerns, some 
serums with moderate NT 50 s failed to block the infectivity of a beta strain.
INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2-elicited immune response has no significant association 
with AEs. BNT162b2-efficacy is likely diminished to under detection limit by 6-7 
months post-1st shot. High-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums 
potently to moderately block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants; however, a 
few moderate-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums failed to do so. If 
BNT162b2-elicited immunity memory is short, an additional vaccine or other 
protective measures would be needed.
RESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Evidence before this study: While mRNA vaccines against 
SARS-CoV-2 have been exceedingly effective in preventing symptomatic viral 
infection, the salient features of immune response including the persistence of 
protection remain to be clarified. There is a report that anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies persist through 6 months after the second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine 
(Doria-Rose et al. N Engl J Med . 2021;384:2259-2261); however, more definite 
immune kinetics following mRNA-vaccine-elicited protection have to be clarified. 
The mRNA-vaccine-elicited protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants are also to be 
determined. Added value of this study: In the present prospective study, 225 
twice-BNT162b2-dose-receiving individuals in Japan were enrolled. No significant 
correlation was seen between 50% neutralizing titers (NT 50 s), determined by 
using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions and live target cells, and adverse effects. 
Largely, NT 50 s and IgG levels were greater in women than in men. Following 28 
days post-2 nd shot, significant reduction was seen in NT 50 s, IgG, and IgM 
levels. The average half-life of NT 50 s was ∼68 days and the average 
time-length for participants' serums to lose the detectable activity was ∼198 
days. Although serums from elite-responders potently to moderately blocked the 
infectivity of variants of concerns, some serums with moderate NT 50 s failed to 
block the infectivity of a beta strain. Implications of all the available 
evidence: BNT162b2 efficacy is likely to be diminished to under detection limit 
by 6-7 months post-1 st shot on average. Individuals with moderate NT 50 s may 
fail to block beta variants. If BNT162b2-elicited immune memory is lost soon, 
additional vaccine(s) or other protective means would be needed.
