Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of 
chronic liver disease in the world. The rising prevalence of nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) has led to a 170% increase in NASH cirrhosis as the 
listing indication for liver transplantation from 2004 to 2013. As of 2018, NASH 
has overtaken hepatitis C as an indication for liver transplantation in the USA. 
After liver transplantation, the allograft often develops recurrent NAFLD among 
patients with known NASH cirrhosis. In addition to recurrent disease, de novo 
NAFLD has been reported in patients with other indications for liver 
transplantation. In this review, we will discuss the risk factors associated 
with recurrent and de novo NAFLD, natural course of the disease, and management 
strategies after liver transplantation.
