DNA, the fundamental unit of human cell, generally exists in Watson-Crick 
base-paired B-DNA form. Often, DNA folds into non-B forms, such as four-stranded 
G-quadruplexes. It is generally believed that ionizing radiation (IR) induces 
DNA strand-breaks in a random manner. Here, we show that regions of DNA enriched 
in G-quadruplex structures are less sensitive to IR compared with B-DNA in vitro 
and inside cells. Planar G-quartet of G4-DNA is shielded from IR-induced free 
radicals, unlike single- and double-stranded DNA. Whole-genome sequence analysis 
and real-time PCR reveal that genomic regions abundant in G4-DNA are protected 
from radiation-induced breaks and can be modulated by G4 stabilizers. Thus, our 
results reveal that formation of G4 structures contribute toward differential 
radiosensitivity of the human genome.
