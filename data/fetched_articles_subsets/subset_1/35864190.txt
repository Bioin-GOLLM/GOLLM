Cirrhosis is usually a late-onset and life-threatening disease characterized by 
fibrotic scarring and inflammation that disrupts liver architecture and 
function. While it is typically the result of alcoholism or hepatitis viral 
infection in adults, its etiology in infants is much less understood. In this 
study, we report 14 children from ten unrelated families presenting with a 
syndromic form of pediatric liver cirrhosis. By genome/exome sequencing, we 
found recessive variants in FOCAD segregating with the disease. Zebrafish 
lacking focad phenocopied the human disease, revealing a signature of altered 
messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation processes in the liver. Using patient's primary 
cells and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation in human hepatic cell lines, we 
found that FOCAD deficiency compromises the SKI mRNA surveillance pathway by 
reducing the levels of the RNA helicase SKIC2 and its cofactor SKIC3. FOCAD 
knockout hepatocytes exhibited lowered albumin expression and signs of 
persistent injury accompanied by CCL2 overproduction. Our results reveal the 
importance of FOCAD in maintaining liver homeostasis and disclose a possible 
therapeutic intervention point via inhibition of the CCL2/CCR2 signaling axis.
