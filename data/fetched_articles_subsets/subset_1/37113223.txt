Candida parapsilosis is an emerging major human fungal pathogen. Echinocandins 
are first-line antifungal drugs for the treatment of invasive Candida 
infections. In clinical isolates, tolerance to echinocandins in Candida species 
is mostly due to point mutations of FKS genes, which encode the target protein 
of echinocandins. However, here, we found chromosome 5 trisomy was the major 
mechanism of adaptation to the echinocandin drug caspofungin, and FKS mutations 
were rare events. Chromosome 5 trisomy conferred tolerance to echinocandin drugs 
caspofungin and micafungin and cross-tolerance to 5-flucytosine, another class 
of antifungal drugs. The inherent instability of aneuploidy caused unstable drug 
tolerance. Tolerance to echinocandins might be due to increased copy number and 
expression of CHS7, which encodes chitin synthase. Although copy number of 
chitinase genes CHT3 and CHT4 was also increased to the trisomic level, the 
expression was buffered to the disomic level. Tolerance to 5-flucytosine might 
be due to the decreased expression of FUR1. Therefore, the pleiotropic effect of 
aneuploidy on antifungal tolerance was due to the simultaneous regulation of 
genes on the aneuploid chromosome and genes on euploid chromosomes. In summary, 
aneuploidy provides a rapid and reversible mechanism of drug tolerance and 
cross-tolerance in C. parapsilosis.
