Initiation of meiosis is the most difficult aspect of inducing competent oocytes 
differentiation from human stem cells in vitro. Human induced pluripotent stem 
cells (hiPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were cultured with follicle 
fluid, cytokines and small molecule to induced oocyte-like cells (OLCs) 
formation through a three-step induction procedure. Expression of surface 
markers and differentiation potential of germ cells were analyzed in vitro by 
flow cytometry, gene expression, immunocytochemistry, western blotting and RNA 
Sequencing. To induce the differentiation of hiPSCs into OLCs, cells were 
firstly cultured with a primordial germ cell medium for 10 days. The cells 
exhibited similar morphological features to primordial germ cells (PGCs), high 
expressing of germ cell markers and primordial follicle development associated 
genes. The induced PGCs were then cultured with the primordial follicle-like 
cell medium for 5 days to form the induced follicle-like structures (iFLs), 
which retained both primordial oocytes-like cells and granulosa-like cells. In 
the third step, the detached iFLs were harvested and transferred to the 
OLC-medium for additional 10 days. The cultured cells developed 
cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) structures and OLCs with different sizes 
(50-150 μm diameter) and a zona pellucida. The in vitro matured OLCs had polar 
bodies and were arrested at metaphase II (MII) stage. Some OLCs were 
self-activated and spontaneously developed into multiple-cell structures similar 
to preimplantation embryos, indicating that OLCs were parthenogenetically 
activated though in vitro fertilization potential of OLCs are yet to be proved. 
in vitro maturation of OLCs derived from hiPSCs provides a new means to study 
human germ cell formation and oogenesis.
