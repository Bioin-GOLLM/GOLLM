Sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) proteins are important 
mediators of protein trafficking that regulate the membrane fusion of specific 
vesicle populations and their target organelles. The SNARE protein Ykt6 lacks a 
transmembrane domain and attaches to different organelle membranes. 
Mechanistically, Ykt6 activity is thought to be regulated by a conformational 
change from a closed cytosolic form to an open membrane-bound form, yet the 
mechanism that regulates this transition is unknown. We identified 
phosphorylation sites in the SNARE domain of Ykt6 that mediate Ykt6 membrane 
recruitment and are essential for cellular growth. Using proximity-dependent 
labeling and membrane fractionation, we found that phosphorylation regulates 
Ykt6 conversion from a closed to an open conformation. This conformational 
switch recruits Ykt6 to several organelle membranes, where it functionally 
regulates the trafficking of Wnt proteins and extracellular vesicle secretion in 
a concentration-dependent manner. We propose that phosphorylation of its SNARE 
domain leads to a conformational switch from a cytosolic, auto-inhibited Ykt6 to 
an active SNARE at different membranes.
