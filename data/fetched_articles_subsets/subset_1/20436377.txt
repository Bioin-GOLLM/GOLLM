Autism is one of the most genetically influenced neuropsychiatric disorders. 
However, its detailed genetic basis is far from being clear. Genome-wide 
association studies have revealed a number of candidate genes, mostly related to 
synaptogenesis and various neuroendocrine pathways. In our study we have focused 
on oxytocin (OT), oxytocin receptor (OXTR), GABA receptor gamma 3 (GABRG3), 
neuroligin (NLGN4X), and reelin (RELN). After signed consent, 90 autistic boys 
and 85 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Polymorphisms of OT 
(rs2740204), OXTR (rs2228485), GABRG3 (rs28431127), and NLGN4X (rs5916338) were 
analyzed using restriction fragment length polymorphism. (GGC)n STR polymorphism 
in the 5' UTR of the RELN gene was genotyped using fragment analysis. The only 
significant association in autistic boys in Slovakia was found with higher 
number of GGC repeats in the RELN gene (P=0.001) potentially explaining lower 
RELN levels in blood and brain of autistic patients.
