OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to assess the effect of unilateral common 
carotid artery occlusion on brain pathophysiology in rats pretreated with 
subchronic hypoxia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats (200 Â± 20 g) were randomized into three groups: 
Group 1 served as sham, Group 2 were normoxic (21% O2 and 79% N2), and Group 3 
were hypoxia preconditioned (10% O2 and 90% N2) for 21 days before left common 
carotid artery occlusion (LCCAO). The LCCAO was done for 75 min followed by 
reperfusion for 12 h. Neurological scores were recorded. Serum malondialdehyde 
(MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels at pre- and 12 h post-LCCAO were measured. 
Brain histopathological assessments were also done.
RESULTS: Higher neurological deficits scores in Group 2 as compared to Group 3 
rats were noticed. Serum MDA and NO levels at 12 h post-LCCAO in Group 2 rats 
showed significant elevation as compared to preocclusion levels. Group 3 rats 
did not show such elevations. On histopathology of left and right cerebral 
hemispheres of Group 1 (sham) did not show any specific changes. In Group 2 
rats, the right cerebral hemisphere (nonoccluded) showed no areas of 
ischemia-induced brain changes, but in the left side (occlusive), there were 
features of ischemic brain damage including cerebral edema. In the case of Group 
3 rats, there were less ischemic damages in the left occluded side as compared 
to the left side of the Group 2 rats.
CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that subchronic hypoxia pretreatment 
can reduce ischemic brain injury by unilateral common carotid artery occlusion 
in rats.
