NAD+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the key enzyme 
in the inactivation pathway of prostaglandins. It is a member of the short-chain 
dehydrogenase family of enzymes. A relatively conserved threonine residue 
corresponding to threonine 188 of 15-PGDH is proposed to be involved in the 
interaction with the carboxamide group of NAD+. Site-directed mutagenesis was 
used to examine the important role of this residue. Threonine 188 was changed to 
alanine (T188A), serine (T188S) or tyrosine (T188Y) and the mutant proteins were 
expressed in E. coli. Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of 
mutant proteins were similar to that of the wild type protein. Mutants T188A and 
T188Y were found to be inactive. Mutant T188S still retained substantial 
activity and the Km value for PGE2 was similar to the wild enzyme; however, the 
Km value for NAD+ was increased over 100 fold. These results suggest that 
threonine 188 is critical for interaction with NAD+ and contributes to the full 
catalytic activity of 15-PGDH.
