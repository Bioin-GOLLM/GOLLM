The leukocyte integrins LFA-1, Mac-1 and p150,95 (CD11a/CD18, CD11b/CD18, 
CD11c/CD18) mediate crucial leukocyte adhesive functions in immune and 
inflammatory reactions. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) disease is caused by 
the defective expression of these adhesion molecules on leukocytes, and is 
characterized by recurrent infections and impaired pus formation due to the 
blockade of leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues. LAD is originated by 
heterogeneous mutations affecting the CD18 gene and, based on the severity of 
the deficiency, two phenotypes (severe and moderate) have been defined. 
Biochemical and genetic studies have allowed the classification of five 
different types of LAD. We have identified a type V LAD patient (severe 
phenotype, and normal size and levels of both CD18 precursor and CD18 mRNA), and 
determined its molecular basis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
and cloning and sequencing of CD18 cDNA derived from this patient revealed three 
silent mutations and a missense mutation that leads to the substitution of 
glycine at position 169 for an arginine. Analysis of patient-derived cDNA clones 
revealed the concomitant presence of aberrant splicing within the 5' region of 
the CD18 gene. The description of an identical mutation at residue 169 in an 
unrelated severe LAD patient raises the possibility that severe LAD type V is 
caused by a unique genetic defect.
