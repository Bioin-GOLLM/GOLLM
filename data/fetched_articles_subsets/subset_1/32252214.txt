PURPOSE: This study evaluated the -202 A/C insulin-like growth factor binding 
protein 3 (IGFBP-3) promoter polymorphism as a predictor of serum IGFBP-3 
concentration and growth velocity after recombinant growth hormone (rhGH) 
therapy in patients with idiopathic short stature (ISS).
METHODS: Genotyping and serial measurement of clinical parameters were performed 
in 69 children with a confirmed diagnosis of ISS. Restriction fragment length 
polymorphism analysis was performed to determine the genotype at the -202 
IGFBP-3 locus. Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGFBP-3 levels 
were measured at baseline and after 1 year of rhGH treatment, as were height 
standard deviation score and growth velocity.
RESULTS: The -202 A/C IGFBP-3 genotype comprised 69.6% AA, 24.6% AC, and 5.8% 
CC. One year of treatment did not produce a meaningful difference in IGF-1 or 
IGFBP-3 levels between children in the AA group and those with at least one copy 
of the C allele (AC/CC group). Comparing the 2 groups after one year also 
revealed no significant difference in growth velocity (ΔHeight: 9.061±1.612 
cm/yr in the AA group, 9.421±1.864 in the AC/CC group, P=0.419).
CONCLUSION: rhGH treatment was effective and there were no significant 
differences in IGF-1, IGFBP-3, or growth velocity according to genotype. Thus, 
-202 IGFBP-3 genotype may not be a major factor affecting individual growth 
responses in Korean children with ISS.
