Mutations of filaggrin gene (FLG) have been identified as the cause of 
ichthyosis vulgaris, while recently FLG mutations were found to be associated 
with gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association of 
filaggrin polymorphism with Epstein-Barr virus-associated tumors in China. A 
total of 200 patients with three types of tumors and 117 normal control samples 
were genotyped at three common FLG mutation loci (rs3126085, K4671X, R501X) by 
using Sequenom MassARRAY technique. The Ï‡ 2 test was used to evaluate the 
relationship between the mutation and the three kinds of tumors. A two-sided P 
value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results showed that 
two single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci (rs3126085, K4671X) were 
significantly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in genetic model. In 
addition, the two SNPs K4671X and rs3126085 were related to Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV)-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC) and EBV-negative gastric carcinoma 
(EBVnGC), respectively. Furthermore, allele distributions in EBVaGC and EBVnGC 
were verified to be different in both SNP loci.
