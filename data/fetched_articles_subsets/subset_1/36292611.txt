Malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare autosomal dominant pharmacogenetic disorder 
of skeletal muscle calcium regulation, is triggered by sevoflurane in 
susceptible individuals. We report a Korean having MH with multi-minicore 
myopathy functionally supported by RYR1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release 
testing in B lymphocytes. A 14-year-old boy was admitted for the evaluation of 
progressive torticollis accompanied by cervicothoracic scoliosis. During the 
preoperative drape of the patient for the release of the sternocleidomastoid 
muscle under general anesthesia, his wrist and ankle were observed to have 
severe flexion contracture. The body temperature was 37.1 Â°C. To treat MH, the 
patient was administered a bolus of dantrolene intravenously (1.5 mg/kg) and 
sodium bicarbonate. After a few minutes, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and EtCO2 
all resolved. Next-generation panel sequencing for hereditary myopathy 
identified a novel RYR1 heterozygous missense variant (NM_000540.2: c.6898T > C; 
p.Ser2300Pro), which mapped to the MH2 domain of the protein, a hot spot for MH 
mutations. Ex vivo RYR1-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release testing in B 
lymphocytes showed hypersensitive Ca2+ responses to isoflurane and caffeine, 
resulting in an abnormal Ca2+ release only in the proband, not in his family 
members. Our findings expand the clinical and pathological spectra of 
information associated with MH with multi-minicore myopathy.
