The aim of the present study was to evaluate the distribution of polymorphisms 
for the androgen receptor (AR) (CAG, StuI, GGN), SRD5A2 (Ala49Thr, Val89Leu) and 
CYP17 (MspA1) genes that are considered to be relevant for risk of prostate 
cancer. We studied 200 individuals from two cities in the State of São Paulo, by 
PCR, PCR-RFLP and ASOH techniques. The allelic frequencies of the autosomal 
markers and the StuI polymorphism of the AR gene were very similar to those 
described in most North American and European populations. In relation to the 
CAG and GGN number of repeats, the study subjects had smaller repeat lengths 
(mean of 20.65 and 22.38, respectively) than those described in North American, 
European and Chinese populations. In the present study, 30.5% of the individuals 
had less than 22 CAG repeats and 45.5% had less than 23 GGN repeats. When both 
repeat lengths are considered jointly, this Brazilian population is remarkably 
different from the others. Further studies on prostate cancer patients need to 
be conducted to assess the significance of these markers in the Brazilian 
population.
