Methanol is a liquid with high energy storage capacity that holds promise as an 
alternative substrate to replace sugars in the biotechnology industry. It can be 
produced from CO2 or methane and its use does not compete with food and animal 
feed production. However, there are currently only limited biotechnological 
options for the valorization of methanol, which hinders its widespread adoption. 
Here, we report the conversion of the industrial platform organism Escherichia 
coli into a synthetic methylotroph that assimilates methanol via the energy 
efficient ribulose monophosphate cycle. Methylotrophy is achieved after 
evolution of a methanol-dependent E. coli strain over 250 generations in 
continuous chemostat culture. We demonstrate growth on methanol and biomass 
formation exclusively from the one-carbon source by 13C isotopic tracer 
analysis. In line with computational modeling, the methylotrophic E. coli strain 
optimizes methanol oxidation by upregulation of an improved methanol 
dehydrogenase, increasing ribulose monophosphate cycle activity, channeling 
carbon flux through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and downregulating 
tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. En route towards sustainable bioproduction 
processes, our work lays the foundation for the efficient utilization of 
methanol as the dominant carbon and energy resource.
