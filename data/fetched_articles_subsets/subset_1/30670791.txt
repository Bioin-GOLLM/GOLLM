Angiosarcoma is a deadly neoplasm of the vascular endothelium. Metastatic 
disease is often present at diagnosis, and 5-year survival is only 10-35%. 
Although there exist no immunocompetent mouse models of angiosarcoma with which 
to study immune-based approaches to therapy, angiosarcoma is a major killer of 
companion dogs, responsible for up to 2% of all canine deaths in some 
susceptible breeds or an estimated 120,000 per year in the US. The canine 
disease (HSA) often presents in the spleen as acute hemoabdomen secondary to 
splenic rupture. Even if life-saving splenectomy is performed, median overall 
survival (OS) is only 48 days, and 1-year survival is negligible. Here we report 
the analysis of a pilot phase I open-label trial of chemo-immunotherapy 
performed on consecutively presenting splenectomized canines with histologically 
verified HSA. Subjects received an abbreviated course of low-dose doxorubicin 
plus alpha interferon and an autologous dendritic cell-therapy reported to 
enhance durable CD8+ memory. Disease was monitored monthly by abdominal 
ultrasound, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram. Median OS in the per protocol 
population was 109 days including one of five animals that died cancer-free at 
16 months after documented resolution of relapsed disease. These results 
indicate that therapeutic administration of chemo-immunotherapy is both feasible 
and safe, substantiating the rationale for additional veterinary and 
humanÂ clinical studies.
