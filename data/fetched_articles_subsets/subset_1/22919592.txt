In recent times, increased attention has been given to evaluating the efficacy 
of phage therapy, especially in scenarios where the bacterial infectious agent 
of interest is highly antibiotic resistant. In this regard, phage therapy is 
especially applicable to infections caused by the Burkholderia cepacia complex 
(BCC) since members of the BCC are antibiotic pan-resistant. Current studies in 
BCC phage therapy are unique from many other avenues of phage therapy research 
in that the investigation is not only comprised of phage isolation, in vitro 
phage characterization and assessment of in vivo infection model efficacy, but 
also adapting aerosol drug delivery techniques to aerosol phage formulation 
delivery and storage.
