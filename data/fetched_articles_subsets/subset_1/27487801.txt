Hair straightness/curliness is one of the most conspicuous features of human 
variation and is particularly diverse among populations. A recent genome-wide 
scan found common variants in the Trichohyalin (TCHH) gene that are associated 
with hair straightness in Europeans, but different genes might affect this 
phenotype in other populations. By sampling 2899 Han Chinese, we performed the 
first genome-wide scan of hair straightness in East Asians, and found EDAR 
(rs3827760) as the predominant gene (P = 4.67 × 10-16), accounting for 3.66 % of 
the total variance. The candidate gene approach did not find further significant 
associations, suggesting that hair straightness may be affected by a large 
number of genes with subtle effects. Notably, genetic variants associated with 
hair straightness in Europeans are generally low in frequency in Han Chinese, 
and vice versa. To evaluate the relative contribution of these variants, we 
performed a second genome-wide scan in 709 samples from the Uyghur, an admixed 
population with both eastern and western Eurasian ancestries. In Uyghurs, both 
EDAR (rs3827760: P = 1.92 × 10-12) and TCHH (rs11803731: P = 1.46 × 10-3) are 
associated with hair straightness, but EDAR (OR 0.415) has a greater effect than 
TCHH (OR 0.575). We found no significant interaction between EDAR and TCHH 
(P = 0.645), suggesting that these two genes affect hair straightness through 
different mechanisms. Furthermore, haplotype analysis indicates that TCHH is not 
subject to selection. While EDAR is under strong selection in East Asia, it does 
not appear to be subject to selection after the admixture in Uyghurs. These 
suggest that hair straightness is unlikely a trait under selection.
