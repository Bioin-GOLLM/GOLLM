OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the clinical and genetic features of patients with 
TNFRSF1A variants in Japan using data obtained from a nationwide survey 
conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan study group for 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS).
METHODS: Inquiries were sent to 2,900 departments of internal medicine and 
pediatrics in all hospitals with more than 200 beds in Japan, asking whether 
they had patients in whom TRAPS was suspected. Genetic tests for TNFRSF1A, MEFV, 
and MVK were performed on 169 patients. Cell surface expression of TNFRSF1A 
variants was assessed using 293T cells.
RESULTS: Ten patients from 10 independent families were found to have TNFRSF1A 
variants. We collected clinical and genetic information on 41 additional 
patients with TNFRSF1A variants and symptoms of inflammation from 23 independent 
families; 17 of these patients had not been described in the literature. The 
common clinical features of Japanese patients were fever of >38°C (100% of 
patients), arthralgia (59%), and rash (55%). The prevalence of abdominal pain 
(36%), myalgia (43%), and amyloidosis (0%) was significantly lower in Japanese 
patients than in Caucasian patients. The most common variant was T61I (appearing 
in 49% of patients), and it was identified in 7 of 363 healthy controls. Defects 
in cysteine residues and the T50M variant were associated with decreased cell 
surface expression, while other variants, including T61I, were not.
CONCLUSION: Patients with TNFRSF1A variants are very rare in Japan, as in other 
countries, but there are a number of clinical and genetic differences between 
Japanese and Caucasian patients. The pathogenic significance of the T61I variant 
remains unclear.
