The human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) regulates its transcription products in 
specialised and distinct ways as compared to nuclear transcription. Thanks to 
its mtDNA mitochondria possess their own set of tRNAs, rRNAs and mRNAs that 
encode a subset of the protein subunits of the electron transport chain 
complexes. The RNA regulation within mitochondria is organised within 
specialised, membraneless, compartments of RNA-protein complexes, called the 
Mitochondrial RNA Granules (MRGs). MRGs were first identified to contain nascent 
mRNA, complexed with many proteins involved in RNA processing and maturation and 
ribosome assembly. Most recently, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) species, a hybrid 
of the two complementary mRNA strands, were found to form granules in the matrix 
of mitochondria. These RNA granules are therefore components of the 
mitochondrial post-transcriptional pathway and as such play an essential role in 
mitochondrial gene expression. Mitochondrial dysfunctions in the form of, for 
example, RNA processing or RNA quality control defects, or inhibition of 
mitochondrial fission, can cause the loss or the aberrant accumulation of these 
RNA granules. These findings underline the important link between mitochondrial 
maintenance and the efficient expression of its genome.
