BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) 
have changed significantly in the last decade. Few studies have evaluated 
changes in outcomes and factors associated with survival in MBM patients over 
time. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes in clinical features and 
overall survival (OS) for MBM patients.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MBMs from 1/1/2009 to 12/31/2013 (Prior Era; 
PE) and 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2018 (Current Era; CE) at The University of Texas MD 
Anderson Cancer Center were included in this retrospective analysis. The primary 
outcome measure was OS. Log-rank test assessed differences between groups; 
multivariable analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards models and 
recursive partitioning analysis (RPA).
RESULTS: A total of 791 MBM patients (PE, n = 332; CE, n = 459) were included in 
analysis. Median OS from MBM diagnosis was 10.3 months (95% CI, 8.9-12.4) and 
improved in the CE vs PE (14.4 vs 10.3 months, P < .001). Elevated serum lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) was the only factor associated with worse OS in both PE and 
CE patients. Factors associated with survival in CE MBM patients included 
patient age, primary tumor Breslow thickness, prior immunotherapy, 
leptomeningeal disease, symptomatic MBMs, and whole brain radiation therapy. 
Several factors associated with OS in the PE were not significant in the CE. RPA 
demonstrated that elevated serum LDH and prior immunotherapy treatment are the 
most important determinants of survival in CE MBM patients.
CONCLUSIONS: OS and factors associated with OS have changed for MBM patients. 
This information can inform contemporary patient management and clinical 
investigations.
