PURPOSE: Despite many studies attributing HPV infection to oropharyngeal 
tumorigenesis, its involvement in non-oropharyngeal cancers is ambiguous. We 
have evaluated the mutation profile of p16 along with protein expression and 
correlated it with the HPV status in oral cancers.
METHODS: Somatic mutations in p16 were studied by exome sequencing (n=25) and 
validated by Sequenom Mass spectrometry (n=50).  Expression of p16 was studied 
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlated with HPV16/18 status evaluated by 
PCR, and IHC (n=221) in oral cancers.
RESULTS: Out of 25 oral cancer patients' samples sequenced by Exome sequencing, 
p16 mutations were found in 4 samples (16%). All the p16 mutations were 
identified in patients with cancers in the site of gingivobuccal complex and not 
tongue subsite. All the 4 patients with p16 mutations had failed treatment, and 
showed a significantly poor disease-free survival. Insilico analysis of the 
types of p16 mutations showed mutated, truncated p16 protein having an increased 
intrinsic disorder, and all the mutations involved truncation post arginine. 
Validation of the p16 mutations by mass spectrometry showed 8/50 (16%) of 
patients harbouring pArg80Ter mutation, of which 7/8 (87.5%) had failed 
treatment.  Overexpression of p16 in >70% of the tumour cells was found in 21.4% 
(26/121) OSCC patients, 6.75% (5/74) OPML patients and p16 expression was 
significantly correlated (p=0.001; χ2 = 25.601) to the grade. All the samples 
were studied for HPV presence by PCR and IHC. We found that none of the p16 
positive tumours showing expression in >70% of the tumour cells harbored HPV 
both by PCR as well as IHC.
CONCLUSION: Our study emphasises the importance of p16 in oral cancers, and 
shows that oral cancer is not HPV associated and p16 expression is not a 
surrogate marker for HPV.
