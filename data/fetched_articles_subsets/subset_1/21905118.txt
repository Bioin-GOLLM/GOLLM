The fibrillization of α-synuclein (α-syn) is a key event in the pathogenesis of 
α-synucleinopathies. Mutant α-syn (A53T, A30P, or E46K), each linked to familial 
Parkinson's disease, has altered aggregation properties, fibril morphologies, 
and fibrillization kinetics. Besides α-syn, Lewy bodies also contain several 
associated proteins including small heat shock proteins (sHsps). Since α-syn 
accumulates intracellularly, molecular chaperones like sHsps may regulate α-syn 
folding and aggregation. Therefore, we investigated if the sHsps αB-crystallin, 
Hsp27, Hsp20, HspB8, and HspB2B3 bind to α-syn and affect α-syn aggregation. We 
demonstrate that all sHsps bind to the various α-syns, although the binding 
kinetics suggests a weak and transient interaction only. Despite this transient 
interaction, the various sHsps inhibited mature α-syn fibril formation as shown 
by a Thioflavin T assay and atomic force microscopy. Interestingly, HspB8 was 
the most potent sHsp in inhibiting mature fibril formation of both wild-type and 
mutant α-syn. In conclusion, sHsps may regulate α-syn aggregation and, 
therefore, optimization of the interaction between sHsps and α-syn may be an 
interesting target for therapeutic intervention in the pathogenesis of 
α-synucleinopathies.
