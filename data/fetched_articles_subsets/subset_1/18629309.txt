BACKGROUND: Nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group I, member 2 (NR1I2), commonly 
known as steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) in humans, is a key 
ligand-dependent transcription factor responsible for the regulation of 
xenobiotic, steroid, and bile acid metabolism. The ligand-binding domain is 
principally responsible for species-specific activation of NR1I2 in response to 
xenobiotic exposure.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective in this study was to create a common framework for 
screening NR1I2 orthologs from a variety of model species against 
environmentally relevant xenobiotics and to evaluate the results in light of 
using these species as predictors of xenobiotic disposition and for assessment 
of environmental health risk.
METHODS: Sixteen chimeric fusion plasmid vectors expressing the Gal4 DNA-binding 
domain and species-specific NR1I2 ligand-binding domain were screened for 
activation against a spectrum of 27 xenobiotic compounds using a standardized 
cotransfection receptor activation assay.
RESULTS: NR1I2 orthologs were activated by various ligands in a dose-dependent 
manner. Closely related species show broadly similar patterns of activation; 
however, considerable variation to individual compounds exists, even among 
species varying in only a few amino acid residues.
CONCLUSIONS: Interspecies variation in NR1I2 activation by various ligands can 
be screened through the use of in vitro NR1I2 activation assays and should be 
taken into account when choosing appropriate animal models for assessing 
environmental health risk.
