In higher plants the L-galactose pathway represents the major route for 
ascorbate biosynthesis. The first committed step of this pathway is catalyzed by 
the enzyme GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase and is encoded by two paralogs in 
Arabidopsis - VITAMIN C2 (VTC2) and VTC5. The first mutant of this enzyme, 
vtc2-1, isolated via an EMS mutagenesis screen, has approximately 20-30% of 
wildtype ascorbate levels and has been reported to have decreased growth under 
standard laboratory conditions. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertion into the 
VTC2 causes a similar reduction in ascorbate levels, but does not greatly affect 
plant growth. Subsequent segregation analysis revealed the growth defects of 
vtc2-1 mutants segregate independently of the vtc2-1 mutation. These 
observations suggest that it is the presence of an independent cryptic mutation 
that affects growth of vtc2-1 mutants, and not the 70-80% decrease in ascorbate 
levels that has been assumed in past studies.
