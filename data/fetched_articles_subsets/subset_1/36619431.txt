This study aimed to directly detect the V617F point mutation of the Janus kinase 
2 (JAK2) gene in the target DNA using a FRET-based biosensor. The water-soluble 
GSH-CdTe-QDs were synthesized by a one-step process, then GSH-QD conjugated to 
the termini amino-modified oligonucleotides target via carboxylic groups on the 
QD surface. The prepared QDs-DNA biosensor was applied in the quantitative and 
rapid detection of V617F mutation with a detection limit of 3 × 10-9 mol L-1 
based on the FRET mechanism. In other words, detecting the V617F mutation by 
bio-sensing technology would be much simpler, cheaper, time-saving, highly 
sensitive, and more convenient than molecular diagnostic tools. Furthermore, the 
nano-biosensor was applied to detect the V617F mutation in clinical samples 
compared to the common ARMS-PCR (Amplification Refractory Mutation 
System-Polymerase Chain Reaction) standard method. The results revealed that the 
GSH-capped biosensors would be effective for V617F mutation detection in samples 
distinguished with satisfactory analytical outcomes. Therefore, the designed 
fluorescence nanoprobe is suitable for the specific detection of V617F mutation 
of the JAK2 gene in clinical samples.
