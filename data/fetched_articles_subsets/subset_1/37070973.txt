The MYC oncoprotein is activated in a broad spectrum of human malignancies and 
transcriptionally reprograms the genome to drive cancer cell growth. Given this, 
it is unclear if targeting a single effector of MYC will have therapeutic 
benefit. MYC activates the polyamine-hypusine circuit, which posttranslationally 
modifies the eukaryotic translation factor eIF5A. The roles of this circuit in 
cancer are unclear. Here we report essential intrinsic roles for hypusinated 
eIF5A in the development and maintenance of MYC-driven lymphoma, where the loss 
of eIF5A hypusination abolishes malignant transformation of MYC-overexpressing B 
cells. Mechanistically, integrating RNA sequencing, ribosome sequencing, and 
proteomic analyses revealed that efficient translation of select targets is 
dependent upon eIF5A hypusination, including regulators of G1-S phase cell-cycle 
progression and DNA replication. This circuit thus controls MYC's proliferative 
response, and it is also activated across multiple malignancies. These findings 
suggest the hypusine circuit as a therapeutic target for several human tumor 
types.
SIGNIFICANCE: Elevated EIF5A and the polyamine-hypusine circuit are manifest in 
many malignancies, including MYC-driven tumors, and eIF5A hypusination is 
necessary for MYC proliferative signaling. Not-ably, this circuit controls an 
oncogenic translational program essential for the development and maintenance of 
MYC-driven lymphoma, supporting this axis as a target for cancer prevention and 
treatment. See related commentary by Wilson and Klein, p. 248. This article is 
highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 247.
