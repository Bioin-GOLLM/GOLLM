PURPOSE: Human choroidal melanocytes become evident in the last trimester of 
development, but very little is known about them. To better understand normal 
and diseased choroidal melanocyte biology we examined their precursors, 
melanoblasts (MB), in mouse eyes during development, particularly their relation 
to the developing vasculature and immune cells.
METHODS: Naïve B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J albino mice were used between embryonic (E) day 
15.5 and postnatal (P) day 8, with adult controls. Whole eyes, posterior 
segments, or dissected choroidal wholemounts were stained with antibodies 
against tyrosinase-related protein 2, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 
or isolectin B4, and examined by confocal microscopy. Immunoreactive cell 
numbers in the choroid were quantified with Imaris. One-way ANOVA with Tukey's 
post hoc test assessed statistical significance.
RESULTS: Small numbers of MB were present in the presumptive choroid at E15.5 
and E18.5. The density significantly increased between E18.5 (381.4 ± 45.8 
cells/mm2) and P0 (695.2 ± 87.1 cells/mm2; P = 0.032). In postnatal eyes MB 
increased in density and formed multiple layers beneath the choriocapillaris. MB 
in the periocular mesenchyme preceded the appearance of vascular structures at 
E15.5. Myeloid cells (Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1-positive) were 
also present at high densities from this time, and attained adult-equivalent 
densities by P8 (556.4 ± 73.6 cells/mm2).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that choroidal MB and myeloid cells are both present 
at very early stages of mouse eye development (E15.5). Although MB and 
vascularization seemed to be unlinked early in choroidal development, they were 
closely associated at later stages. MB did not migrate into the choroid in 
waves, nor did they have a consistent relationship with nerves.
