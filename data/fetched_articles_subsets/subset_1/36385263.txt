Association between exposure to periodontal bacteria and development of 
autoantibodies related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been widely accepted; 
however, direct causal relationship between periodontal bacteria and rheumatoid 
factor (RF) is currently not fully understood. We investigated whether 
periodontal bacteria could affect RF status. Patients with preclinical, 
new-onset, or chronic RA underwent periodontal examination, and investigation of 
subgingival microbiome via 16S rRNA sequencing. Degree of arthritis and RF 
induction was examined in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice that were orally 
inoculated with different periodontal bacteria species. Subsequently, 
single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the mouse spleen cells was performed. 
Patients with preclinical RA showed an increased abundance of the 
Porphyromonadacae family in the subgingival microbiome compared to those with 
new-onset or chronic RA, despite comparable periodontitis severity among them. 
Notably, a distinct subgingival microbial community was found between patients 
with high-positive RF and those with negative or low-positive RF (p=0.022). Oral 
infections with the periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis and Treponema denticola 
in CIA mice similarly enhanced arthritis score, but resulted in different levels 
of RF induction. Genes related to B cell receptor signaling, B cell 
proliferation, activation, and differentiation, and CD4+ T cell costimulation 
and cytokine production were involved in the differential induction of RF in 
mice exposed to different bacteria. In summary, periodontal microbiome might 
shape RF status by affecting the humoral immune response during RA pathogenesis.
