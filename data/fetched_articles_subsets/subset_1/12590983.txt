Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a member of the fibroblast growth 
factor family that possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities and is 
involved in a variety of biological processes. We investigated possible genetic 
polymorphism in the promoter and 5' flanking region of the bFGF gene. 
Polymorphism was analysed by means of heteroduplex analysis, fragments with 
altered mobility were sequenced. Three novel substitutions (-553T/A, -834T/A and 
-921C/G) were identified in the promoter region. Allele frequencies in a sample 
of healthy Caucasian subjects (n=126) were determined by polymerase chain 
reactions followed by restriction analyses with specific endonucleases. The 
frequencies of the mutated alleles (-553A, -834A and -921G) were 0.04, 0.05 and 
0.14, respectively. Newly identified variants in the bFGF gene promoter appear 
to be common polymorphisms in the Czech population.
