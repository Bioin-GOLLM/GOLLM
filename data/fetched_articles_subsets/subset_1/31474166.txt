The aim of the present study was to determine whether IL-6 polymorphisms 
correlate with sepsis. According to the inclusion criteria, the association of 
IL-6 polymorphisms with sepsis was searched in databases and analysed using 
comprehensive meta-analysis software. A total of 16 studies were included in 
this meta-analysis. There was no significant association between the IL-6-174G/C 
polymorphism and sepsis risk in the total population (C vs. G: OR = 1.04, 95% 
CI = 0.79–1.38; CC vs. GG: OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.53–1.41; CG vs. GG: OR = 0.99, 
95% CI = 0.79–1.24; dominant model: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.74–1.29; recessive 
model: OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.61–1.39). When patients were stratified according 
to ethnicity, a statistically significant association was observed in Asians and 
Africans. As for the -572G/C polymorphism, the results showed that the 
IL-6-572C/G polymorphism was not associated with sepsis susceptibility (G vs. C: 
OR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.79–1.22; GG vs. CC: OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 0.53–4.03; GC vs. 
CC: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.54–1.27; dominant model: OR = 0.88, 95% 
CI = 0.55–1.41; recessive model: OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.82–2.92). The data 
indicated that the IL-6-174G/C polymorphism may contribute to sepsis risk, 
especially in Africans and Asians. No significant association was observed 
between the IL-6-572G/C polymorphism and sepsis risk.
