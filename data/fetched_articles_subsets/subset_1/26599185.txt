IMPORTANCE: Peripheral neuropathy is a highly prevalent and morbid condition 
affecting 2% to 7% of the population. Patients frequently experience pain and 
are at risk of falls, ulcerations, and amputations. We aimed to review recent 
diagnostic and therapeutic advances in distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most 
common subtype of peripheral neuropathy.
OBSERVATIONS: Current evidence supports limited routine laboratory testing in 
patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Patients without a known cause 
should undergo a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, 
vitamin B12 measurement, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, 
fasting glucose measurement, and glucose tolerance test. The presence of 
atypical features such as asymmetry, non-length dependence, motor predominance, 
acute or subacute onset, and prominent autonomic involvement should prompt a 
consultation with a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist. Electrodiagnostic 
tests and magnetic resonance imaging of the neuroaxis contribute substantial 
cost to the diagnostic evaluation, but evidence supporting their use is lacking. 
Strong evidence supports the use of tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and voltage-gated calcium channel ligands in 
the treatment of neuropathic pain. More intensive glucose control substantially 
reduces the incidence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy in patients with type 1 
diabetes but not in those with type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The opportunity exists to improve 
guideline-concordant testing in patients with distal symmetric polyneuropathy. 
Moreover, the role of electrodiagnostic tests needs to be further defined, and 
interventions to reduce magnetic resonance imaging use in this population are 
needed. Even though several efficacious medications exist for neuropathic pain 
treatment, pain is still underrecognized and undertreated. New disease-modifying 
medications are needed to prevent and treat peripheral neuropathy, particularly 
in type 2 diabetes.
