Nuclear magnetic resonance at low field strength is an insensitive spectroscopic 
technique, precluding portable applications with small sample volumes, such as 
needed for biomarker detection in body fluids. Here we report a compact double 
resonant chip stack system that implements in situ dynamic nuclear polarisation 
of a 130 nL sample volume, achieving signal enhancements of up to - 60 w.r.t. 
the thermal equilibrium level at a microwave power level of 0.5 W. This work 
overcomes instrumental barriers to the use of NMR detection for point-of-care 
applications.
