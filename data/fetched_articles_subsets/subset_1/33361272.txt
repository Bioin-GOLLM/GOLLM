Immune-checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) 
therapies have profoundly improved the survival of patients with melanoma. 
However, a majority of patients do not respond to these agents, and many 
responders experience disease relapse. Although numerous innovative treatments 
are being explored to offset the limitations of these agents, novel therapeutic 
combinations with immunotherapies have the potential to improve patient 
responses. In this study, we evaluated the antimelanoma activity of 
immunotherapy combinations with Telaglenastat (CB-839), a potent glutaminase 
inhibitor (GLSi) that has favorable systemic tolerance. In in vitro TIL:tumor 
coculture studies, CB-839 treatment improved the cytotoxic activity of 
autologous TILs on patient-derived melanoma cells. CB-839 treatment decreased 
the conversion of glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate (αKGA) more potently in tumor 
cells versus TILs in these cocultures. These results suggest that CB-839 may 
improve immune function in a tumor microenvironment by differentially altering 
tumor and immune cell metabolism. In vivo CB-839 treatment activated melanoma 
antigen-specific T cells and improved their tumor killing activity in an 
immune-competent mouse model of adoptive T-cell therapy. Additionally, the 
combination of CB-839 with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4 antibodies increased tumor 
infiltration by effector T cells and improved the antitumor activity of these 
checkpoint inhibitors in a high mutation burden mouse melanoma model. 
Responsiveness to these treatments was also accompanied by an increase of 
interferon gamma (IFNγ)-associated gene expression in the tumors. Together, 
these results provide a strong rationale for combining CB-839 with immune 
therapies to improve efficacy of these treatments against melanoma.
