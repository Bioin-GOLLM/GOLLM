Using active site model molecules consisting of approximately 100 atoms, the 
reduction potentials of five type-1 Cu centers in cucumber stellacyanin, fern 
dryopteris crassirhizoma plastocyanin, Met148Gln rusticyanin, wild type 
rusticyanin, and Met148Leu rusticyanin were calculated with a heterogeneous 
conductor-like polarizable continuum model and the B3LYP/6-311++G(2df,p) method. 
The results are 242, 366, 522, 667, and 825 mV, respectively, in good agreement 
with experimental values 260, 376, 563, 667, and 798 mV. Ligand interaction ( 
approximately 250 mV) and solvation effect ( approximately 250 mV) are found to 
be the main determinants of the relative E(0) of these five type-1 Cu centers.
