Biogenesis of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, which produces 
the bulk of ATP for almost all eukaryotic cells, depends on the translation of 
13 mtDNA-encoded polypeptides by mitochondria-specific ribosomes in the 
mitochondrial matrix. These mitoribosomes are dual-origin ribonucleoprotein 
complexes, which contain mtDNA-encoded rRNAs and tRNAs and ∼80 nucleus-encoded 
proteins. An increasing number of gene mutations that impair mitoribosomal 
function and result in multiple OXPHOS deficiencies are being linked to human 
mitochondrial diseases. Using exome sequencing in two unrelated subjects 
presenting with sensorineural hearing impairment, mild developmental delay, 
hypoglycemia, and a combined OXPHOS deficiency, we identified mutations in the 
gene encoding the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S2, which has not previously 
been implicated in disease. Characterization of subjects' fibroblasts revealed a 
decrease in the steady-state amounts of mutant MRPS2, and this decrease was 
shown by complexome profiling to prevent the assembly of the small mitoribosomal 
subunit. In turn, mitochondrial translation was inhibited, resulting in a 
combined OXPHOS deficiency detectable in subjects' muscle and liver biopsies as 
well as in cultured skin fibroblasts. Reintroduction of wild-type MRPS2 restored 
mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS assembly. The combination of lactic 
acidemia, hypoglycemia, and sensorineural hearing loss, especially in the 
presence of a combined OXPHOS deficiency, should raise suspicion for a 
ribosomal-subunit-related mitochondrial defect, and clinical recognition could 
allow for a targeted diagnostic approach. The identification of MRPS2 as an 
additional gene related to mitochondrial disease further expands the genetic and 
phenotypic spectra of OXPHOS deficiencies caused by impaired mitochondrial 
translation.
