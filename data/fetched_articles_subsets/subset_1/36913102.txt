PURPOSE: We examined the inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by a nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-TiO2) 
visible-light photocatalyst that was activated via light irradiation in the 
natural environment and was safe for human use as a coating material.
METHODS: The photocatalytic activity of glass slides coated with three types of 
N-TiO2 without metal or loaded with copper or silver and copper was investigated 
by measuring acetaldehyde degradation. The titer levels of infectious SARS-CoV-2 
were measured using cell culture after exposing photocatalytically active coated 
glass slides to visible light for up to 60 min.
RESULTS: N-TiO2 photoirradiation inactivated the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and 
this effect was enhanced by copper loading and further by the addition of 
silver. Hence, visible-light irradiation using silver and copper-loaded N-TiO2 
inactivated the Delta, Omicron, and Wuhan strains.
CONCLUSION: N-TiO2 could be used to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 variants, including 
emerging variants, in the environment.
