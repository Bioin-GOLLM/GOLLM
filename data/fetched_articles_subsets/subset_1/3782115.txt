dismutase.

Recombinant human CuZn superoxide dismutase as expressed in yeast has been 
crystallized in three different crystal forms. Hexagonal plates grow from 2.4 M 
ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, and belong to the space group P6(3)22, with cell 
dimensions a = b = 113.5(3), c = 151.5(5) A, and Vm = 2.21 A3/dalton for two 
dimers per asymmetric unit. At 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, chunky wedges 
grow in space group C222(1), a = 205.2(6), b = 166.5(4), c = 145.4(4) A with a 
Vm of 2.43 A3/dalton for eight dimers per asymmetric unit. With polyethylene 
glycol 8000, pH 7.5-8.0, hexagonal prisms are obtained with cell dimensions a = 
b = 197.4(6), c = 43.1(2) A, space group P6, and Vm = 2.53 A3/dalton for three 
dimers per asymmetric unit. All of these forms diffract to high resolution, are 
stable to x-rays, and appear suitable for determination of the atomic structure. 
Crystals of the doubly mutated enzyme (Cys6----Ala, Cys111----Ser) grown from 
both micro- and macroseeds of the wild type protein demonstrate the feasibility 
of isomorphous crystallization of site-directed mutants of the cloned parent 
enzyme for comparative structure-function studies.
