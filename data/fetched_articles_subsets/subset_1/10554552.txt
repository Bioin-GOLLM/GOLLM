BACKGROUND: Mutations in the kerato-epithelin gene on chromosome 5 q 31 are 
known to cause four distinct autosomal dominant diseases of the human cornea: 
Reis-Bücklers, granular, lattice, and Avellino corneal dystrophy. Mutation of 
arginin to glutamine in codon 555 (R 555 Q) in kerato-epithelin was recently 
reported in four blood-related patients with Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy.
CASE: A 42 year-old female has had photophobia with decreasing vision since the 
age of 20 years. Her corrected visual acuity was 0.5 in both eyes. She showed 
subepithelial opacities in both corneas characteristic of Reis-Bücklers corneal 
dystrophy.
METHOD: The DNA was extracted from leukocytes according to standard protocols. 
The keratoepithelin gene was examined for a mutation by the polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing.
FINDINGS: We identified kerato-epithelin mutation R 555 Q. The patient's two 
children and 50 controls did not show missense mutation.
CONCLUSION: Kerato-epithelin mutation R 555 Q was present in a Japanese patient 
with Reis-Bücklers corneal dystrophy.
