A long-standing mystery shrouds the mechanism by which catalytically repressed 
receptor tyrosine kinase domains accomplish transphosphorylation of activation 
loop (A-loop) tyrosines. Here we show that this reaction proceeds via an 
asymmetric complex that is thermodynamically disadvantaged because of an 
electrostatic repulsion between enzyme and substrate kinases. Under 
physiological conditions, the energetic gain resulting from ligand-induced 
dimerization of extracellular domains overcomes this opposing clash, stabilizing 
the A-loop-transphosphorylating dimer. A unique pathogenic fibroblast growth 
factor receptor gain-of-function mutation promotes formation of the complex 
responsible for phosphorylation of A-loop tyrosines by eliminating this 
repulsive force. We show that asymmetric complex formation induces a more 
phosphorylatable A-loop conformation in the substrate kinase, which in turn 
promotes the active state of the enzyme kinase. This explains how quantitative 
differences in the stability of ligand-induced extracellular dimerization 
promotes formation of the intracellular A-loop-transphosphorylating asymmetric 
complex to varying extents, thereby modulating intracellular kinase activity and 
signaling intensity.
