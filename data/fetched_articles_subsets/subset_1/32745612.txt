In newly diagnosed systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, next-generation 
sequencing of plasma-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) detects somatic mutations as 
accurate as genotyping of the tumor biopsy. A distinct diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma entity confined to the central nervous system is primary central 
nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), which requires intracerebral biopsy and 
neuropathologic analysis to establish the diagnosis. So far, a biomarker for 
diagnosis and follow-up of PCNSL that can be investigated in blood has not been 
identified. This article addresses the question whether somatic mutations of the 
CD79B and MYD88 driver genes of PCNSL can be detected in cfDNA at disease 
diagnosis. Stereotactic biopsies and cfDNA of 27 PCNSL patients were analyzed 
for CD79B and MYD88 mutations. As control, cfDNA derived from six healthy 
volunteers was used. CD79B and MYD88 hot spot mutations were identified in 16 of 
27 (59%) and 23 of 27 (85%) PCNSL biopsies, respectively, but only in 0 of 27 
(0%) and 1 of 27 (4%) corresponding cfDNA samples, respectively. In cfDNA of one 
of four patients with Waldenstrom disease, as a further control, the MYD88 L265P 
mutation was readily detected, despite complete clinical remission. These data 
suggest that in PCNSL even if they carry such mutations, alterations of CD79B 
and MYD88 cannot be reliably detected in blood-derived cfDNA obtained before 
intracerebral biopsy.
