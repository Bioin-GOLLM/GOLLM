The Z mutant of alpha1-antitrypsin (Glu342Lys) causes a domain swap and the 
formation of intrahepatic polymers that aggregate as inclusions and predispose 
the homozygote to cirrhosis. We have identified an allosteric cavity that is 
distinct from the interface involved in polymerization for rational 
structure-based drug design to block polymer formation. Virtual ligand screening 
was performed on 1.2 million small molecules and 6 compounds were identified 
that reduced polymer formation in vitro. Modeling the effects of ligand binding 
on the cavity and re-screening the library identified an additional 10 compounds 
that completely blocked polymerization. The best antagonists were effective at 
ratios of compound to Z alpha1-antitrypsin of 2.5:1 and reduced the 
intracellular accumulation of Z alpha1-antitrypsin by 70% in a cell model of 
disease. Identifying small molecules provides a novel therapy for the treatment 
of liver disease associated with the Z allele of alpha1-antitrypsin.
