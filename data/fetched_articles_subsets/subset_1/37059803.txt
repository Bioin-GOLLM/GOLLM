Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic, non-membranous structures composed of 
non-translating mRNAs and various proteins and play critical roles in cell 
survival under stressed conditions. Extensive proteomics analyses have been 
performed to identify proteins in SGs; however, the molecular functions of these 
components in SG formation remain unclear. In this report, we show that 
ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) is a crucial component of SGs. 
UBAP2L localized to SGs in response to various stresses, and its depletion 
significantly suppressed SG organization. Proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses 
found that UBAP2L formed a protein-RNA complex with Ras-GTP-activating protein 
SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). In 
vitro binding analysis demonstrated that snoRNAs were required for UBAP2L 
association with G3BP1. In addition, decreased expression of snoRNAs reduced the 
interaction between UBAP2L and G3BP1 and suppressed SG formation. Our results 
reveal a critical role of SG component, the UBAP2L/snoRNA/G3BP1 protein-RNA 
complex, and provide new insights into the regulation of SG assembly.
