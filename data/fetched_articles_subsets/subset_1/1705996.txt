We generated a number of simian virus 40 (SV40) mutants with single amino acid 
substitutions in T antigen between residues 388 and 411. All but one mutant 
(398LV) replicated like wild-type SV40 and gave rise to normal-size plaques. 
Three different mutations at residue 402 (Asp to Glu, Asn, or His) totally 
prevented the formation of stable complexes with the cellular protein p53 in 
monkey cells but had no effect on virus replication. Only one other mutation in 
this region, involving residue 401 (Met to Thr), slightly inhibited the 
formation of T-monkey p53 complexes. The three mutant T antigens with 
substitutions at residue 402 also formed no stable complexes with human p53 but 
generated low levels of complexes with mouse p53. These results indicate that 
residue 402 is critical for binding to monkey and human p53 proteins and is 
important for binding to mouse p53. We suggest that it is one of several points 
of contact. In cells infected with any one of the three residue 402 mutant 
viruses. T antigen and p53 became increasingly phosphorylated, as they were in 
cells infected with wild-type virus. Our data therefore show that stable T-p53 
complexes are not required for replication of SV40 in culture or for enhanced 
phosphorylation of either protein.
