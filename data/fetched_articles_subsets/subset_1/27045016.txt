Elf and colleagues used an elegant series of functional and biochemical assays 
to investigate the molecular mechanism of mutant calreticulin (CALR)-driven 
cellular transformation in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Mutant CALR is 
sufficient to induce MPN in mouse transplantation experiments, and 
transformation is dependent upon physical interaction mediated by the positive 
electrostatic charge of the mutant CALR C-terminal domain and the thrombopoietin 
receptor MPL.
