Signaling to the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates diverse 
cellular processes, including protein translation, cellular proliferation, 
metabolism, and autophagy. Most models place Akt upstream of the mTOR complex, 
mTORC1; however, in T cells, Akt may not be necessary for mTORC1 activation. We 
found that the adaptor protein Carma1 [caspase recruitment domain 
(CARD)-containing membrane-associated protein 1] and at least one of its 
associated proteins, the paracaspase MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 
lymphoma translocation protein 1), were required for optimal activation of mTOR 
in T cells in response to stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the 
co-receptor CD28. However, Bcl10, which binds to Carma1 and MALT1 to form a 
complex that mediates signals from the TCR to the transcription factor NF-κB 
(nuclear factor κB), was not required. The catalytic activity of MALT1 was 
required for the proliferation of stimulated CD4+ T cells, but not for early 
TCR-dependent activation events. Consistent with an effect on mTOR, MALT1 
activity was required for the increased metabolic flux in activated CD4+ T 
cells. Together, our data suggest that Carma1 and MALT1 play previously 
unappreciated roles in the activation of mTOR signaling in T cells after 
engagement of the TCR.
