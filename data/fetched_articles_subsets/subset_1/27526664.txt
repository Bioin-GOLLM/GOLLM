Plasma concentration of apoA-I, apoA-II and apoA-II-unassociated apoA-I was 
analyzed in 314 Japanese subjects (177 males and 137 females), including one 
(male) homozygote and 37 (20 males and 17 females) heterozygotes of genetic CETP 
deficiency. ApoA-I unassociated with apoA-II markedly and linearly increased 
with HDL-cholesterol, while apoA-II increased only very slightly and the ratio 
of apoA-II-associated apoA-I to apoA-II stayed constant at 2 in molar ratio 
throughout the increase of HDL-cholesterol, among the wild type and heterozygous 
CETP deficiency. Thus, overall HDL concentration almost exclusively depends on 
HDL with apoA-I without apoA-II (LpAI) while concentration of HDL containing 
apoA-I and apoA-II (LpAI:AII) is constant having a fixed molar ratio of 2 : 1 
regardless of total HDL and apoA-I concentration. Distribution of apoA-I between 
LpAI and LpAI:AII is consistent with a model of statistical partitioning 
regardless of sex and CETP genotype. The analysis also indicated that LpA-I 
accommodates on average 4 apoA-I molecules and has a clearance rate 
indistinguishable from LpAI:AII. Independent evidence indicated LpAI:A-II has a 
diameter 20% smaller than LpAI, consistent with a model having two apoA-I and 
one apoA-II. The functional contribution of these particles is to be 
investigated.
