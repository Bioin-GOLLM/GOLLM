OBJECTIVE: Skeletal muscle vasculature undergoes arteriogenesis to restore 
tissue perfusion and function following loss of blood flow. This process has 
been shown to occur in large vessels following ischemia, although recent studies 
suggest this may occur in the microcirculation as well. We tested the hypothesis 
that ischemia induces microvascular remodeling in the skeletal muscle 
microcirculation on the scale of capillary to sub-35 mum diameter arterioles.
METHODS: Ligations of a feeding arteriole to the caudal-half of the 
spinotrapezius muscle were performed on C57BL/6 mice. At 5 days, microvascular 
remodeling responses were quantified using intravital and whole-mount confocal 
microscopy. Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize vessels, 
incorporated leukocytes, and regions of hypoxia.
RESULTS: Ischemic tissue underwent localized microvascular remodeling 
characteristic of arteriogenesis, including pronounced vessel tortuosity. In 
patent microvessels (diameters 15-35 microm), we observed increases in vascular 
density (38%), branching (90%) and collateral development (36.5%). The formation 
of new arterioles (diameters 6-35 microm) increased by 24.3%, while chronic 
hypoxia was absent from all tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic injury induces arteriogenesis in skeletal muscle 
microcirculation. Furthermore, this surgical model enables en face analysis of 
microcirculatory adaptations with single-cell resolution and can provide 
investigators with morphometric data on a microscale that is difficult to 
achieve using other models.
