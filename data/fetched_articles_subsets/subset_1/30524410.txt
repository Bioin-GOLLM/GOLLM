EspF is a central effector protein of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), 
enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and Citrobacter rodentium (CR) that is secreted 
through the type III secretion system to host cells. The interaction between 
EspF and host proteins plays an important role in bacterial pathogenesis. EspF 
protein binds to host SNX9 and N-WASP proteins to promote the colonization of 
pathogenic bacteria in intestinal epithelial cells; combines with cytokeratin 
18, actin, 14-3-3Î¶, Arp2/3, profilin, and ZO-1 proteins to intervene in the 
redistribution of intermediate filaments, the rearrangement of actin, and the 
disruption of tight junctions; acts together with Abcf2 to boost host cell 
intrinsic apoptosis; and collaborates with Anxa6 protein to inhibit 
phagocytosis. The interaction between EspF and host proteins is key to the 
pathogenic mechanism of EHEC and EPEC. Here, we review how EspF protein 
functions through interactions with these 10 host proteins and contributes to 
the pathogenicity of EHEC/EPEC.
