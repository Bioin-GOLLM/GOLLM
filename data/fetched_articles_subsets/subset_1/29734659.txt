Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) holds a 
great promise for regenerative medicine and has been studied in several major 
directions. However, cell-cycle regulation, a fundamental biological process, 
has not been investigated during iCM-reprogramming. Here, our time-lapse imaging 
on iCMs, reprogrammed by Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT) monocistronic 
retroviruses, revealed that iCM-reprogramming was majorly initiated at late-G1- 
or S-phase and nearly half of GMT-reprogrammed iCMs divided soon after 
reprogramming. iCMs exited cell cycle along the process of reprogramming with 
decreased percentage of 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU)⁺/&alpha;-myosin heavy 
chain (&alpha;MHC)-GFP⁺ cells. S-phase synchronization post-GMT-infection could 
enhance cell-cycle exit of reprogrammed iCMs and yield more GFPhigh iCMs, which 
achieved an advanced reprogramming with more expression of cardiac genes than 
GFPlow cells. However, S-phase synchronization did not enhance the reprogramming 
with a polycistronic-viral vector, in which cell-cycle exit had been 
accelerated. In conclusion, post-infection synchronization of S-phase 
facilitated the early progression of GMT-reprogramming through a mechanism of 
enhanced cell-cycle exit.
