The right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is the major origin of ventricular 
arrhythmias, including premature ventricular contractions, idiopathic 
ventricular arrhythmias, Brugada syndrome, torsade de pointes, long QT syndrome, 
and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The RVOT has distinct 
developmental origins and cellular characteristics and a complex myocardial 
architecture with high shear wall stress, which may lead to its high 
vulnerability to arrhythmogenesis. RVOT myocytes are vulnerable to intracellular 
sodium and calcium overload due to calcium handling protein modulation, enhanced 
CaMKII activity, ryanodine receptor phosphorylation, and a higher cAMP level 
activated by predisposing factors or pathological conditions. A reduction in 
Cx43 and Scn5a expression may lead to electrical uncoupling in RVOT. The purpose 
of this review is to update the current understanding of the cellular and 
molecular mechanisms of RVOT arrhythmogenesis.
