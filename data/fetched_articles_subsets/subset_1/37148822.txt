Prime Editor (PE) is a precise genome manipulation technology based on the 
CRISPR-Cas9 system, while its application in human induced pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSCs) remains limited. Here, we established a repaired hiPS cell line 
(SKLRMi001-A-1) from hiPSCs with androgen receptor (AR) mutation (c.2710G > A; 
p.V904M). The repaired iPSC line expressed pluripotency markers, retained normal 
karyotype, showed the capability of differentiating into three germ layers and 
was absence of mycoplasma infection. The repaired iPSC line will help to 
elucidate the mechanism of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and benefit 
treatment for AIS in the future.
