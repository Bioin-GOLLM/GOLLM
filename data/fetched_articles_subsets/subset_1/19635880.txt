Alterations in gene expression in the midgut of female Culex pipiens 
quinquefasciatus exposed to blood meals containing 6.8 logs plaque-forming 
units/mL of West Nile virus (WNV) were studied by fluorescent differential 
display. Twenty-six different cDNAs exhibited reproducible differences after 
feeding on infected blood. Of these, 21 cDNAs showed an increase in expression, 
and 5 showed a decrease in expression as a result of WNV presence in the blood 
meal. GenBank database searches showed that one clone with increased expression, 
CQ G12A2, shares 94% identity with a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein from 
Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and 32% identity to Toll-like receptors from Aedes 
aegypti. We present the first cDNA clone isolated from female Cx. p. 
quinquefasciatus midgut tissue whose expression changes on exposure to WNV. This 
cDNA represents a mosquito gene that is an excellent candidate for interacting 
with WNV in Cx. p. quinquefasciatus and may play a role in disease transmission.
