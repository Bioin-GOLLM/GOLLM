BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an ongoing neurological degeneration 
characterized by amnesia and a decline in cognitive abilities. Hippocampal 
neurogenesis is the leading cause of AD. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a 
prodromal state of AD, is mainly due to the degradation of neuropsychiatric 
manifestations. Previous systematic reviews demonstrated that treatment with 
acupuncture with Chinese herbs is tolerable and effective in improving cognitive 
function in patients with AD. Our investigation aimed to discover the main 
acupoint combination for AD management based on a preceding systematic review 
and meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our investigation was executed using association rule 
analysis, which is a common data mining technique accessible within R. Our study 
elucidated acupoint locations as binary data from 15 of the included studies 
using the Apriori algorithm.
RESULTS: Thirty-two acupoints were selected from 15 RCTs. The 10 most frequent 
acupoints were selected. We inspected 503 association rules using the 
interpreted acupuncture data. The obtained results showed that {SP6, BI10} ≥ 
{HT7} and {HT7, BI10} ≥ {SP6} were the most associated rules in 15 RCTs.
CONCLUSION: The combination of acupoints ({SP6, BI10} ≥ {HT7} and {HT7, BI10} ≥ 
{SP6}) can be acknowledged as a core combination for future acupuncture regimens 
of AD.
