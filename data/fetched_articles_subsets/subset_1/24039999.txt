BACKGROUND: The association between polymorphisms on 5p12 and breast cancer (BC) 
has been widely evaluated since it was first identified through genome-wide 
association approach; however, the studies have yielded contradictory results. 
We sought to investigate this inconsistency by performing a comprehensive 
meta-analysis on two wildly studied polymorphisms (rs10941679 and rs4415084) on 
5p12.
METHODS: Databases including Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane 
Library databases were searched to find relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) with 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of association. 
The random-effects model was applied, addressing heterogeneity and publication 
bias.
RESULTS: A total of 19 articles involving 100,083 cases and 163,894 controls 
were included. An overall random-effects per-allele OR of 1.09 (95% CI: 
1.06-1.12; P = 4.5 × 10(-8)) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.05-1.12; P = 4.2 × 10(-7)) was 
found for the rs10941679 and rs4415084 polymorphism respectively. Significant 
results were found in Asians and Caucasians when stratified by ethnicity; 
whereas no significant associations were found among Africans/African-Americans. 
Similar results were also observed using dominant or recessive genetic models. 
In addition, we find both rs4415084 and rs10941679 conferred significantly 
greater risks of ER-positive breast cancer than of ER-negative tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that rs10941679-G allele and rs4415084-T 
allele might be risk-conferring factors for the development of breast cancer, 
especially in Caucasians and East-Asians.
