BACKGROUND: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7903146 (C/T), located in 
intron 4 of the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), has been associated 
with an increased risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, although the molecular 
mechanism remain elusive. The TCF7L2 gene is alternatively spliced but an 
association between genotype and splice variants has not been shown 
convincingly. We hypothesized that a yet unknown extra exon, containing either 
the C or T genotype of the SNP rs7903146, could introduce a premature stop codon 
and consequently result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).
FINDINGS: Running the sequences C and T of the SNP region in different servers 
we found that the two alleles could display differential recognition by splicing 
factors. The C variant showed the possible inclusion of an unknown exon. This 
unknown exon contained a stop codon and thus could induce NMD. We then 
determined that the splicing pattern in isolated mouse islets and MIN6 cells was 
similar to that in human pancreatic islets. Therefore, we used MIN6 cells to 
study the splicing of human intron 4: two mini-genes of intron 4 containing 
either the C/C genotype or the T/T genotype were transfected into MIN6 cells. 
Our constructs were spliced normally, excluding intron 4, but we did not observe 
the presence of an extra exon with either construct.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that an extra exon could theoretically exist, although we 
were not able to capture it in our model. A better model is needed to determine 
whether a theoretical extra exon can induce NMD.
