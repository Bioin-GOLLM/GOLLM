When creating titanium-containing bone implants, the bioactive coatings that 
promote their rapid engraftment are important. The engraftment rate of titanium 
implants with bone tissue depends significantly on the modification of the 
implant surface. It is achieved by changing either the relief or the chemical 
composition of the surface layer, as well as a combination of these two factors. 
In this work, we studied the creation of composite coatings with a two-level 
(the micro- and nanolevel) hierarchy of the surface relief, which have bioactive 
and bactericidal properties, which are promising for bone implantation. Using 
the developed non-lithographic template electrochemical synthesis, a composite 
coating on titanium with a controlled surface structure was created based on an 
island-type TiO2 film, silver and hydroxyapatite (HAp). This TiO2/Ag/HAp 
composite coating has a developed surface relief at the micro- and nanolevels 
and has a significant cytological response and the ability to accelerate 
osteosynthesis, and also has an antibacterial effect. Thus, the developed 
biomaterial is suitable for production of dental and orthopedic implants with 
improved biomedical properties.
