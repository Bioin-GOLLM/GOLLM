Under normal conditions, high sodium (Na+) in extracellular (Na+e) and blood 
(Na+b) compartments and low Na+ in intracellular milieu (Na+i) produce strong 
transmembrane (ΔNa+mem) and weak transendothelial (ΔNa+end) gradients 
respectively, and these manifest the cell membrane potential (Vm) as well as 
blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. We developed a sodium (23Na) magnetic 
resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) method using an 
intravenously-administered paramagnetic polyanionic agent to measure ΔNa+mem and 
ΔNa+end. In vitro 23Na-MRSI established that the 23Na signal is intensely 
shifted by the agent compared to other biological factors (e.g., pH and 
temperature). In vivo 23Na-MRSI showed Na+i remained unshifted and Na+b was more 
shifted than Na+e, and these together revealed weakened ΔNa+mem and enhanced 
ΔNa+end in rat gliomas (vs. normal tissue). Compared to normal tissue, RG2 and 
U87 tumors maintained weakened ΔNa+mem (i.e., depolarized Vm) implying an 
aggressive state for proliferation, whereas RG2 tumors displayed elevated 
∆Na+end suggesting altered BBB integrity. We anticipate that 23Na-MRSI will 
allow biomedical explorations of perturbed Na+ homeostasis in vivo.
