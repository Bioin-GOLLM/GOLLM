Escherichia coli is an important model organism in microbiology and a prominent 
member of the human microbiota1. Environmental isolates readily colonize the 
gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals, and they can serve diverse 
probiotic, commensal and pathogenic roles in the host2-4. Although certain 
strains have been associated with the severity of inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD)2,5, the diverse immunomodulatory phenotypes remain largely unknown at the 
molecular level. Here, we decode a previously unknown E. coli metabolic pathway 
that produces a family of hybrid pterin-phenylpyruvate conjugates, which we 
named the colipterins. The metabolites are upregulated by subinhibitory levels 
of the antifolate sulfamethoxazole, which is used to treat infections including 
in patients with IBD6,7. The genes folX/M and aspC/tyrB involved in monapterin 
biosynthesis8-10 and aromatic amino acid transamination,11 respectively, were 
required to initiate the colipterin pathway. We show that the colipterins are 
antioxidants, harbour diverse immunological activities in primary human tissues, 
activate anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and improve colitis symptoms in a 
colitis mouse model. Our study defines an antifolate stress response in E. coli 
and links its associated metabolites to a major immunological marker of IBD.
