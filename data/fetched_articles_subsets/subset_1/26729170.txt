BACKGROUND: Elderly patients receiving anticancer drugs may have an increased 
risk to develop treatment-related toxicities compared to their younger peers. 
However, a potential pharmacokinetic (PK) basis for this increased risk has not 
consistently been established yet. Therefore, the objective of this study was to 
systematically review the influence of age on the PK of anticancer agents 
frequently administered to elderly breast cancer patients.
METHODS: A literature search was performed using the PubMed electronic database, 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and available drug approval reviews, 
as published by EMA and FDA. Publications that describe age-related PK profiles 
of selected anticancer drugs against breast cancer, excluding endocrine 
compounds, were selected and included.
RESULTS: This review presents an overview of the available data that describe 
the influence of increasing age on the PK of selected anticancer drugs used for 
the treatment of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Selected published data revealed differences in the effect and 
magnitude of increasing age on the PK of several anticancer drugs. There may be 
clinically-relevant, age-related PK differences for anthracyclines and platina 
agents. In the majority of cases, age is not a good surrogate marker for 
anticancer drug PK, and the physiological state of the individual patient may 
better be approached by looking at organ function, Charlson Comorbidity Score or 
geriatric functional assessment.
