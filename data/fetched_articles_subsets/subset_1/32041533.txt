BACKGROUND: Yellow fever vaccine exists for over 80 years and is considered to 
be relatively safe. However, in rare cases it can produce serious neurotropic 
and viscerotropic complications. We report a case of a patient who presented 
both viscerotropic and neurological manifestations after yellow fever 
vaccination.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 37 years old man who developed 
after the yellow fever vaccination a yellow fever vaccine-associated 
viscerotropic disease followed by acute uveitis. Prolonged detection of yellow 
fever RNA in blood and urine was consistent with yellow fever vaccine-associated 
adverse event. The final outcome was good, although with persistent fatigue over 
a few months.
CONCLUSIONS: Even if the yellow fever vaccine is relatively safe, physicians 
should be aware of its possible serious adverse effects.
