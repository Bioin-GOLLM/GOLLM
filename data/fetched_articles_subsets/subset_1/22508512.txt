Munc13-4 is a widely expressed member of the CAPS/Munc13 protein family proposed 
to function in priming secretory granules for exocytosis. Munc13-4 contains N- 
and C-terminal C2 domains (C2A and C2B) predicted to bind Ca(2+), but 
Ca(2+)-dependent regulation of Munc13-4 activity has not been described. The C2 
domains bracket a predicted SNARE-binding domain, but whether Munc13-4 interacts 
with SNARE proteins is unknown. We report that Munc13-4 bound Ca(2+) and 
restored Ca(2+)-dependent granule exocytosis to permeable cells (platelets, 
mast, and neuroendocrine cells) dependent on putative Ca(2+)-binding residues in 
C2A and C2B. Munc13-4 exhibited Ca(2+)-stimulated SNARE interactions dependent 
on C2A and Ca(2+)-dependent membrane binding dependent on C2B. In an apparent 
coupling of membrane and SNARE binding, Munc13-4 stimulated SNARE-dependent 
liposome fusion dependent on putative Ca(2+)-binding residues in both C2A and 
C2B domains. Munc13-4 is the first priming factor shown to promote 
Ca(2+)-dependent SNARE complex formation and SNARE-mediated liposome fusion. 
These properties of Munc13-4 suggest its function as a Ca(2+) sensor at 
rate-limiting priming steps in granule exocytosis.
