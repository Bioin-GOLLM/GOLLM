This study aimed to purify and identify antiphotoaging peptides from oyster 
(Crassostrea hongkongensis) protein enzymatic hydrolysates (OPEH) and to 
investigate the possible mechanism underlying its antiphotoaging effect. 
Multiple methods (Ultrafiltration, G25 Chromatography, RP-HPLC, and LC/MS/MS) 
had been used for this purpose, and eventually, two peptides, including WNLNP 
and RKNEVLGK, were identified. Particularly, WNLNP exerted remarkable 
antiphotoaging effect on the UVB-irradiated HaCaT photoaged cell model in a 
dose-dependent manner. WNLNP exerted its protective effect mainly through 
inhibiting ROS production, decreasing MMP-1 expression, but increasing 
extracellular pro-collagen I content. Furthermore, WNLNP downregulated p38, JNK, 
ERK, and p65 phosphorylation in the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway and attenuated 
bax over-expressions but reversed bcl-2 reduction in UVB- irradiated HaCaT 
cells. The molecular docking analysis showed that WNLNP forms five and seven 
hydrogen bonds with NF-κB (p65) and MMP-1, respectively. This study suggested 
that a pentapeptide WNLNP isolated from OPEH had great potential to prevent and 
regulate skin photoaging.
