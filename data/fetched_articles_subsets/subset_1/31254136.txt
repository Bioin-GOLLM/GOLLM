Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the predominant cell type in the blood 
vessel wall and normally adopt a quiescent, contractile phenotype. VSMC 
migration is tightly controlled, however, disease associated changes in the 
soluble and insoluble environment promote VSMC migration. Classically, studies 
investigating VSMC migration have described the influence of soluble factors. 
Emerging data has highlighted the importance of insoluble factors, including 
extracellular matrix stiffness and porosity. In this review, we will recap on 
the important signalling pathways that regulate VSMC migration and reflect on 
the potential importance of emerging regulators of VSMC function.
