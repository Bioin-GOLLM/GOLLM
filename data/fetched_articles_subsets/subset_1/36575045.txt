BACKGROUND: MCM8 has been reported highly expressed in several human 
malignancies. However, its role in HCC has not yet been researched.
METHODS: The prognostic significance of MCM8 mRNA expression was analyzed using 
datasets from TCGA and GEO databases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was used 
to detect the MCM8 protein expression in HCC tissues. The Cox regression 
analysis was employed to determine the independent prognostic value of MCM8. 
Then, we established a nomogram for OS and RFS prediction based on MCM8 protein 
expression. We analyzed the DNA methylation and genetic alteration of MCM8 in 
HCC. Moreover, GO, KEGG and GSEA were utilized to explore the potential 
biological functions of MCM8. Subsequently, we evaluate the correlations between 
MCM8 expression and composition of the tumor microenvironment as well as 
immunocyte infiltration ratio in HCC.
RESULTS: MCM8 mRNA and protein were significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues. 
High MCM8 protein expression was an independent risk factor for OS and RFS of 
HCC patients. MCM8 expression is altered in 60% of queried HCC patients. In 
addition, higher methylation of the CpG site cg03098629, cg10518808, and 
17230679 correlated with lower MCM8 levels. MCM8 expression correlated with cell 
cycle and DNA replication signaling. Moreover, MCM8 may be correlated with 
different compositions of the tumor microenvironment and immunocyte infiltration 
ratio in HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: MCM8 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and was associated with 
poor prognosis. Meanwhile, high expression of MCM8 may induce immune cell 
infiltration and may be a promising prognostic biomarker for HCC.
