Causative genes have been identified only in four types of lipid storage 
myopathies (LSMs): SLC22A5 for primary carnitine deficiency (PCD); ETFA, ETFB, 
and ETFDH for multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD); PNPLA2 
for neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM); and ABHD5 for neutral 
lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. However, the frequency of these LSMs has 
not been determined. We found mutations in only 9 of 37 LSM patients (24%): 3 in 
SLC22A5; 4 in MADD-associated genes; and 2 in PNPLA2. This low frequency 
suggests the existence of other causative genes. Muscle coenzyme Q(10) levels 
were normal or only mildly reduced in two MADD patients, indicating that ETFDH 
mutations may not always be associated with CoQ(10) deficiency. The 2 patients 
with PNPLA2 mutations had progressive, non-episodic muscle disease with rimmed 
vacuoles. This suggests there is a different pathomechanism from other LSMs.
