Biallelic variants of the gene encoding for the zinc-finger protein 142 (ZNF142) 
have recently been associated with intellectual disability (ID), speech 
impairment, seizures, and movement disorders in nine individuals from five 
families. In this study, we obtained phenotype and genotype information of 26 
further individuals from 16 families. Among the 27 different ZNF142 variants 
identified in the total of 35 individuals only four were missense. Missense 
variants may give a milder phenotype by changing the local structure of ZF 
motifs as suggested by protein modeling; but this correlation should be 
validated in larger cohorts and pathogenicity of the missense variants should be 
investigated with functional studies. Clinical features of the 35 individuals 
suggest that biallelic ZNF142 variants lead to a syndromic neurodevelopmental 
disorder with mild to moderate ID, varying degrees of delay in language and 
gross motor development, early onset seizures, hypotonia, behavioral features, 
movement disorders, and facial dysmorphism. The differences in symptom 
frequencies observed in the unpublished individuals compared to those of 
published, and recognition of previously underemphasized facial features are 
likely to be due to the small sizes of the previous cohorts, which underlines 
the importance of larger cohorts for the phenotype descriptions of rare genetic 
disorders.
