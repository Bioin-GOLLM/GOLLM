The detection of KRAS and BRAF mutations is a crucial step for the correct 
therapeutic approach and predicting the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR)-targeted therapy resistance of colorectal carcinomas. The concomitant 
KRAS and BRAF mutations occur rarely in the colorectal cancers (CRCs) with the 
prevalence of less than 0.001% of the cases. In patients with KRAS-mutant 
tumors, BRAF mutations should not regularly be tested unless the patient is 
participating in a clinical trial enriching for the presence of KRAS or 
BRAF-mutated tumor. The current report demonstrates a case with advanced 
adenocarcinoma of the colon showing the coexistence of KRAS and BRAF mutations 
and may have profound clinical implications for disease progression and 
therapeutic responses.
