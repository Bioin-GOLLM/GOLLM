Coordination is essential for improving supply chain performance, and one of the 
most critical factors in achieving the coordination of a supply chain is the 
integrated research of production and distribution. In this paper, a novel 
two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, products 
are processed on the serial machines of multiple manufacturers located in two 
industrial parks. A fuzzy multi-objective scheduling optimization is performed 
using a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). The 
result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to optimize the 
distribution scheduling problem using a modified genetic annealing algorithm 
(GAA). Finally, simulation results verify both the feasibility and efficiency of 
the proposed solution methodology.
