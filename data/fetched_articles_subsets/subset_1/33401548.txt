Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to maintain and/or achieve 
a satisfactory erection. This condition can be influenced by the presence of 
atherosclerosis, a systemic pathology of the vessels that also affects the 
cavernous arteries and which can cause an alteration of blood flow at penile 
level. Among the cardiovascular risk factors affecting the genesis of 
atherosclerosis, hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcys) plays a central role, which is 
associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. This review 
focuses on the biological processes that lead to homocysteine-induced 
endothelial damage and discusses the consequences of HHcys on male sexual 
function.
