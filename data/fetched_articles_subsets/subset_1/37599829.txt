Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease with 
substantial mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunctions. SBMA is caused by 
polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the androgen receptor (AR). Activating or 
increasing the NAD+-dependent deacetylase, SIRT3, reduced oxidative stress and 
death of cells modeling SBMA. However, increasing diminished SIRT3 in AR100Q 
mice failed to reduce acetylation of the SIRT3 target/antioxidant, SOD2, and had 
no effect on increased total acetylated peptides in quadriceps. Yet, 
overexpressing SIRT3 resulted in a trend of motor recovery, and corrected TCA 
cycle activity by decreasing acetylation of SIRT3 target proteins. We sought to 
boost blunted SIRT3 activity by replenishing diminished NAD+ with PARP 
inhibition. Although NAD+ was not affected, overexpressing SIRT3 with PARP 
inhibition fully restored hexokinase activity, correcting the glycolytic pathway 
in AR100Q quadriceps, and rescued motor endurance of SBMA mice. These data 
demonstrate that targeting metabolic anomalies can restore motor function 
downstream of polyQ-expanded AR.
