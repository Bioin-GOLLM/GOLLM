(1) Background: SARS-CoV-2 variants possess specific mutations throughout their 
genome; however, the effect of these mutations on pathogenesis is little known. 
The study aimed to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants and their susceptibility rate 
against monoclonal antibodies, convalescent, and vaccine plasma. (2) Methods: 
Strains isolated from COVID-19 cases in Turkey in April and September 2021 were 
involved. Illuma Nextera XT was processed for NGS, followed by virtual 
phenotyping (Coronavirus Antiviral and Resistance Database (CoV-RDB) by Stanford 
University). (3) Results: Among 211 strains, 79% were SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
B.1.1.7 (Alpha) was the most dominant, followed by B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.351 
(Beta), and B.1.525 (Eta). Alpha and Delta were less susceptible to 
Etesevimab-Sotrovimab and Bamlanivimab-Etesevimab, respectively. Reduced 
efficacy was observed for convalescent plasma in Beta and Delta; AstraZeneca, 
Comirnaty plus AstraZeneca in Alpha; Comirnaty, Moderna, Novovax in Beta; 
Comirnaty in Delta. (4) Conclusion: CoV-RDB analysis is an efficient, rapid, and 
helpful web tool for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection and susceptibility analysis.
