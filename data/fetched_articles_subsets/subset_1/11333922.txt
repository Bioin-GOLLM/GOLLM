To investigate the functional domains of the coat protein (CP; 189 amino acids) 
of Brome mosaic virus, a plant RNA virus, 19 alanine-scanning mutants were 
constructed and tested for their infectivity in barley and Nicotiana 
benthamiana. Despite its apparent normal replicative competence and CP 
production, the C-terminal mutant F184A produced no virions. Furthermore, 
virion-forming C-terminal mutants P178A and D182A failed to move from cell to 
cell in both plant species, and mutants D181A and V187A showed host-specific 
movement. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of CP plays some 
important roles in virus movement and encapsidation. The specificity of certain 
mutations for viral movement in two different plant species is evidence for the 
involvement of host-specific factors.
