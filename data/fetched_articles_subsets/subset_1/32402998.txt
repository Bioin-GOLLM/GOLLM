BACKGROUND: Genotypes associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) may protect 
against bleeding due to a hypercoagulable state. Whether the risk of major 
bleeding is reduced in parallel with an increasing number of prothrombotic 
genotypes during anticoagulant treatment in VTE remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between multiple prothrombotic 
genotypes and risk of major bleeding in patients with VTE.
METHODS: Patients with incident VTE (n = 676) derived from the Tromsø Study were 
genotyped for rs6025 (F5), rs1799963 (F2), rs8176719 (ABO), rs2066865 (FGG) and 
rs2036914 (F11) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Major bleeding events 
were recorded during the first year after VTE according to the International 
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Cox-regression was used to 
calculate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for major bleeding 
adjusted for age, sex and duration of anticoagulation according to individual 
prothrombotic SNPs and categories of risk alleles (5-SNP score; 0-1, 2, 3 and 
≥4).
RESULTS: In total, 50 patients experienced major bleeding (incidence rate: 
9.5/100 person-years, 95% CI 7.2-12.5). The individual SNPs and number of risk 
alleles were not associated with major bleeding risk. The hazard ratios for 
major bleeding per category increase of genetic risk score were 1.0 (95% CI 
0.8-1.3) for the total study population and 1.1 (95% CI 0.8-1.5) when patients 
with active cancer were excluded. Analyses restricted to the first 3 months 
after VTE yielded similar results.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that an increasing number of prothrombotic risk 
alleles is not protective against major bleeding in VTE patients during 
anticoagulation.
