Glu is highly conserved as the first amino acid of E-helix of the EF-hand 
protein. In this paper, Glu 101, the first amino acid of E-helix of the third 
EF-hand motif in Euplotes octocarinatus centrin (EoCen) was mutated to be Lys by 
the method of site direct mutation. Tb3+ and TNS were used as fluorescence 
probes in the study of the effect of this mutation to the metal binding 
characteristic of EoCen by fluorescence spectra. Results indicate that compared 
with EoCen, the mutation protein (E101K) displays a different Tb3+ binding 
characteristic and an increased hydrophobic exposure surface. Polyacrylamide 
gels electrophoresis indicated that the electrophoretic mobilities of EoCen and 
E101K are distinctly different. It can be deduced that the conformation of EoCen 
has been altered by this mutation. The general conditional binding constant of 
Tb3+ to the three loops of EF-hand sites I-III in E101K was calculated to be 
(5.64+/-0.57)x10(5)M(-1) according to the modified equation of the single 
binding process.
