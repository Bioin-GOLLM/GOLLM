Mitochondrial function is necessary to supply the energy required for cell 
metabolism. Mutations/polymorphisms in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been 
implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The mitochondrial transcription factor A 
(TFAM) controls the transcription of mtDNA and regulates the mtDNA-copy number, 
thus being important for maintaining ATP production. TFAM dysfunction may also 
be involved in PD, and TFAM gene mutations/polymorphisms could contribute to the 
risk of developing PD. We searched for gene variants in the seven TFAM-exons in 
a total of 250 PD-patients. We found five common polymorphisms, and only one was 
a missense change (S12T in exon 1). Genotype and allele frequencies did not 
differ between patients and healthy controls (n=225) for the five polymorphisms. 
Our work suggests that TFAM-variants did not contribute to the risk of 
developing PD.
