BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative 
disorder after Alzheimer's disease and gender differences have been described on 
several aspects of PD. In the present commentary, we aimed to collect and 
discuss the currently available evidence on gender differences in PD regarding 
biomarkers, genetic factors, motor and non-motor symptoms, therapeutic 
management (including pharmacological and surgical treatment) as well as 
preclinical studies.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed by searching the Pubmed 
and Scopus databases with the search strings "biomarkers", "deep brain 
stimulation", "female", "gender", "genetic", "levodopa", "men", "male", "motor 
symptoms", "non-motor symptoms", "Parkinson disease", "sex", "surgery", and 
"women".
RESULTS: The present review confirms the existence of differences between men 
and women in Parkinson Disease, pointing out new information regarding evidence 
from animal models, genetic factors, biomarkers, clinical features and 
pharmacological and surgical treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall goal is to acquire new informations about sex and 
gender differences in Parkinson Disease, in order to develop tailored 
intervetions.
