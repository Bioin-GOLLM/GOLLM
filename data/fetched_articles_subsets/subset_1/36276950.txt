Patient variants in Tubby Like Protein-3 (TULP3) have recently been associated 
with progressive fibrocystic disease in tissues and organs. TULP3 is a ciliary 
trafficking protein that links membrane-associated proteins to the 
intraflagellar transport complex A. In mice, mutations in Tulp3 drive phenotypes 
consistent with ciliary dysfunction which include renal cystic disease, as part 
of a ciliopathic spectrum. Here we report two sisters from consanguineous 
parents with fibrocystic renal and hepatic disease harboring a homozygous 
missense mutation in TULP3 (NM_003324.5: c.1144C>T, p.Arg382Trp). The R382W 
patient mutation resides within the C-terminal Tubby domain, a conserved domain 
required for TULP3 to associate with phosphoinositides. We show that inner 
medullary collecting duct-3 cells expressing the TULP3 R382W patient variant 
have a severely reduced ability to localize the membrane-associated proteins 
ARL13b, INPP5E, and GPR161 to the cilium, consistent with a loss of TULP3 
function. These studies establish Arginine 382 as a critical residue in the 
Tubby domain, which is essential for TULP3-mediated protein trafficking within 
the cilium, and expand the phenotypic spectrum known to result from recessive 
deleterious mutations in TULP3.
