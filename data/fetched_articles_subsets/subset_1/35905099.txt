Interindividual variation is important in the response to metformin as the 
first-line therapy for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Considering that OCT1 
and MATE1 transporters determine the metformin pharmacokinetics, this study 
aimed to investigate the influence of SLC22A1 and SLC47A1 variants on the 
steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin and the glycemic response. This 
research used the prospective-cohort study design for 81 patients with T2DM who 
received 500 mg metformin twice a day from six primary healthcare centers. 
SLC22A1 rs628031 A>G (Met408Val) and Met420del genetic variants in OCT1 as well 
as SLC47A1 rs2289669 G>A genetic variant in MATE1 were examined through the 
PCR-RFLP method. The bioanalysis of plasma metformin was performed in the 
validated reversed-phase HPLC-UV detector. The metformin steady-state 
concentration was measured for the trough concentration (Cssmin) and peak 
concentration (Cssmax). The pharmacodynamic parameters of metformin use were the 
fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated albumin (GA). Only SLC22A1 Met420del 
alongside estimated-glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) affected both Cssmax and 
Cssmin with an extremely weak correlation. Meanwhile, SLC47A1 rs2289669 and FBG 
were correlated. This study also found that there was no correlation between the 
three SNPs studied and GA, so only eGFR and Cssmax influenced GA. The average 
Cssmax in patients with the G allele of SLC22A1 Met408Val, reaching 1.35-fold 
higher than those with the A allele, requires further studies with regard to 
metformin safe dose in order to avoid exceeding the recommended therapeutic 
range.
