Relaxin-3 has been proposed to modulate emotional-behavioural functions such as 
arousal and behavioural activation, appetite regulation, stress responses, 
anxiety, memory, sleep and circadian rhythm. The nucleus incertus (NI), in the 
midline tegmentum close to the fourth ventricle, projects widely throughout the 
brain and is the primary site of relaxin-3 neurons. Over recent years, a number 
of preclinical studies have explored the function of the NI and relaxin-3 
signalling, including reports of mRNA or peptide expression changes in the NI in 
response to behavioural or pharmacological manipulations, effects of lesions or 
electrical or pharmacological manipulations of the NI, effects of central 
microinfusions of relaxin-3 or related agonist or antagonist ligands on 
physiology and behaviour, and the impact of relaxin-3 gene deletion or 
knockdown. Although these individual studies reveal facets of the likely 
functional relevance of the NI and relaxin-3 systems for human physiology and 
behaviour, the differences observed in responses between species (e.g. rat vs. 
mouse), the clearly identified heterogeneity of NI neurons and procedural 
differences between laboratories are some of the factors that have prevented a 
precise understanding of their function. This review aims to draw attention to 
the current preclinical evidence available that suggests the relevance of the 
NI/relaxin-3 system to the pathology and/or symptoms of certain neuropsychiatric 
disorders and to provide cognizant directions for future research to effectively 
and efficiently uncover its therapeutic potential.
