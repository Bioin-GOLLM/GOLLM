CONTEXT: Familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) due to aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene mutations is an autosomal dominant 
disease with incomplete penetrance. Clinical screening of apparently unaffected 
AIP mutation (AIPmut) carriers could identify previously unrecognized disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the AIP mutational status of FIPA and young pituitary 
adenoma patients, analyzing their clinical characteristics, and to perform 
clinical screening of apparently unaffected AIPmut carrier family members.
DESIGN: This was an observational, longitudinal study conducted over 7 years.
SETTING: International collaborative study conducted at referral centers for 
pituitary diseases.
PARTICIPANTS: FIPA families (n 216) and sporadic young-onset (30 y) pituitary 
adenoma patients (n 404) participated in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: We performed genetic screening of patients for AIPmuts, clinical 
assessment of their family members, and genetic screening for somatic GNAS1 
mutations and the germline FGFR4 p.G388R variant.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We assessed clinical disease in mutation carriers, 
comparison of characteristics of AIPmut positive and negative patients, results 
of GNAS1, and FGFR4 analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven FIPA families and 34 sporadic patients had AIPmuts. 
Patients with truncating AIPmuts had a younger age at disease onset and 
diagnosis, compared with patients with nontruncating AIPmuts. Somatic GNAS1 
mutations were absent in tumors from AIPmut-positive patients, and the studied 
FGFR4 variant did not modify the disease behavior or penetrance in 
AIPmut-positive individuals. A total of 164 AIPmut-positive unaffected family 
members were identified; pituitary disease was detected in 18 of those who 
underwent clinical screening.
CONCLUSIONS: A quarter of the AIPmut carriers screened were diagnosed with 
pituitary disease, justifying this screening and suggesting a variable clinical 
course for AIPmut-positive pituitary adenomas.
