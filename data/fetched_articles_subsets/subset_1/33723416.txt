Since the initial reports of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unidentified origin 
in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel coronavirus that causes this 
disease - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - has 
spread throughout the world, igniting the twenty-first century's deadliest 
pandemic. Over the past 12 months, a dizzying array of information has emerged 
from numerous laboratories, covering everything from the putative origin of 
SARS-CoV-2 to the development of numerous candidate vaccines. Many immunologists 
quickly pivoted from their existing research to focus on coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) and, owing to this unprecedented convergence of efforts on one 
viral infection, a remarkable body of work has been produced and disseminated, 
through both preprint servers and peer-reviewed journals. Here, we take readers 
through the timeline of key discoveries during the first year of the pandemic, 
which showcases the extraordinary leaps in our understanding of theÂ immune 
response to SARS-CoV-2 and highlights gaps in our knowledge as well as areas for 
future investigations.

Conflict of interest statement: The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has 
filed patent applications relating to SARS-CoV-2 serological assays and 
NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, naming F.K. as co-inventor. The authors would 
also like to note the following, which could be perceived as a conflict of 
interest for F.K.: he has previously published work on influenza virus vaccines 
with S. Gilbert (University of Oxford), has consulted for Curevac, Merck and 
Pfizer (before 2020), is currently consulting for Avimex (Mexico) and Seqirus 
(Australia), his laboratory is collaborating with Pfizer on animal models of 
SARS-CoV-2, his laboratory is collaborating with N. Pardi at the University of 
Pennsylvania on mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, his laboratory was working in 
the past with GlaxoSmithKline on the development of influenza virus vaccines, 
and two of his mentees have recently joined Moderna. A.I. served as a consultant 
for Adaptive Biotechnologies. T.C. declares no competing interests.
