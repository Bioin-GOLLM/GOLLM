MCL1, a BCL2 relative, is critical for the survival of many cells. Its turnover 
is often tightly controlled through both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent 
mechanisms of proteasomal degradation. Several cell stress signals, including 
DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, are known to elicit distinct E3 ligases to 
ubiquitinate and degrade MCL1. Another trigger that drives MCL1 degradation is 
engagement by NOXA, one of its BH3-only protein ligands, but the mechanism 
responsible has remained unclear. From an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 
screen, we discovered that the ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH5, the ubiquitin E2 
conjugating enzyme UBE2K, and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2 
co-operate to mark MCL1 for degradation by the proteasome-specifically when MCL1 
is engaged by NOXA. This mechanism of degradation also required the MCL1 
transmembrane domain and distinct MCL1 lysine residues to proceed, suggesting 
that the components likely act on the MCL1:NOXA complex by associating with it 
in a specific orientation within the mitochondrial outer membrane. MTCH2 has not 
previously been reported to regulate protein stability, but is known to 
influence the mitochondrial localization of certain key apoptosis regulators and 
to impact metabolism. We have now pinpointed an essential but previously 
unappreciated role for MTCH2 in turnover of the MCL1:NOXA complex by MARCH5, 
further strengthening its links to BCL2-regulated apoptosis.
