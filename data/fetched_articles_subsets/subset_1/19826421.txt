BACKGROUND: Alteration in respiratory activity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
transcription seems to be an important feature of cancer cells. Leukotriene D(4) 
(LTD(4)) is a proinflammatory mediator implicated in the pathology of chronic 
inflammation and cancer. We have shown earlier that LTD(4) causes translocation 
of beta-catenin both to the mitochondria, in which it associates with the 
survival protein Bcl-2 identifying a novel role for beta-catenin in cell 
survival, and to the nucleus in which it activates the TCF/LEF transcription 
machinery.
METHODS: Here we have used non-transformed intestinal epithelial Int 407 cells 
and Caco-2 colon cancer cells, transfected or not with wild type and mutated 
(S33Y) beta-catenin to analyse its effect on mitochondria activity. We have 
measured the ATP/ADP ratio, and transcription of the mtDNA genes ND2, ND6 and 16 
s in these cells stimulated or not with LTD(4).
RESULTS: We have shown for the first time that LTD(4) triggers a cellular 
increase in NADPH dehydrogenase activity and ATP/ADP ratio. In addition, LTD(4) 
significantly increased the transcription of mtDNA genes. Overexpression of 
wild-type beta-catenin or a constitutively active beta-catenin mutant mimicked 
the effect of LTD(4) on ATP/ADP ratio and mtDNA transcription. These elevations 
in mitochondrial activity resulted in increased reactive oxygen species levels 
and subsequent activations of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB.
CONCLUSIONS: The present novel data show that LTD(4), presumably through 
beta-catenin accumulation in the mitochondria, affects mitochondrial activity, 
lending further credence to the idea that inflammatory signalling pathways are 
intrinsically linked with potential oncogenic signals.
