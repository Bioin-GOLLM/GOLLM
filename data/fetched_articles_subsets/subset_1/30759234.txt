TDP-43 regulates cellular levels of Cajal bodies (CBs) that provide platforms 
for the assembly and RNA modifications of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins 
(snRNPs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Alterations in these snRNPs may be 
linked to pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, specific roles 
for TDP-43 in CBs remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 regulates the 
CB localization of four UG-rich motif-bearing C/D-box-containing small Cajal 
body-specific RNAs (C/D scaRNAs; i.e. scaRNA2, 7, 9 and 28) through the direct 
binding to these scaRNAs. TDP-43 enhances binding of a CB-localizing protein, 
WD40-repeat protein 79 (WDR79), to a subpopulation of scaRNA2 and scaRNA28; the 
remaining population of the four C/D scaRNAs was localized to CB-like structures 
even with WDR79 depletion. Depletion of TDP-43, in contrast, shifted the 
localization of these C/D scaRNAs, mainly into the nucleolus, as well as 
destabilizing scaRNA2, and reduced the site-specific 2'-O-methylation of U1 and 
U2 snRNAs, including at 70A in U1 snRNA and, 19G, 25G, 47U and 61C in U2 snRNA. 
Collectively, we suggest that TDP-43 and WDR79 have separate roles in 
determining CB localization of subsets of C/D and H/ACA scaRNAs.
