Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer. Particularly, papillary 
thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for the highest proportion of thyroid cancer. Up 
to now, there are few researches discussing the pathogenesis and progression 
mechanisms of PTC from the viewpoint of systems biology approaches. In this 
study, first we constructed the candidate genetic and epigenetic network (GEN) 
consisting of candidate protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) and candidate 
gene regulatory network (GRN) by big database mining. Secondly, system 
identification and system order detection methods were applied to prune 
candidate GEN via next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation profiles 
to obtain the real GEN. After that, we extracted core GENs from real GENs by the 
principal network projection (PNP) method. To investigate the pathogenic and 
progression mechanisms in each stage of PTC, core GEN was denoted in respect of 
KEGG pathways. Finally, by comparing two successive core signaling pathways of 
PTC, we not only shed light on the causes of PTC progression, but also 
identified essential biomarkers with specific gene expression signature. 
Moreover, based on the identified gene expression signature, we suggested 
potential candidate drugs to prevent the progression of PTC with querying 
Connectivity Map (CMap).
