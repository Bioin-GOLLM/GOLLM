Gap junction-mediated intercellular communication facilitates the circulation of 
ions, small molecules, and metabolites in the avascular eye lens. Mutants of the 
lens fiber cell gap junction proteins, connexin46 (Cx46) and connexin50 (Cx50), 
cause cataracts in people and in mice. Studies in mouse models have begun to 
elucidate the mechanisms by which these mutants lead to cataracts. The 
expression of the dominant mutants causes severe decreases in connexin levels, 
reducing the gap junctional communication between lens fiber cells and 
compromising the lens circulation. The impairment of the lens circulation 
results in several changes, including the accumulation of Ca2+ in central lens 
regions, leading to the formation of precipitates that stain with Alizarin red. 
The cataract morphology and the distribution of Alizarin red-stained material 
are similar, suggesting that the cataracts result from biomineralization within 
the organ. In this review, we suggest that this may be a general process for the 
formation of cataracts of different etiologies.
