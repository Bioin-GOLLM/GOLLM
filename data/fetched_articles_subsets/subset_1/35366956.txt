Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that leads to the dysfunction of 
various tissues and organs, including eyes, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. 
According to the World Health Organization, diabetes prevalence is 8.8% globally 
among whom about 90% of cases are type 2 diabetes. There are not any significant 
clinical manifestations in the primary stages of diabetes. Therefore, screening 
can be an efficient way to reduce the diabetic complications. Over the recent 
decades, the prevalence of diabetes has increased alarmingly among the Middle 
East population, which has imposed exorbitant costs on the health care system in 
this region. Given that the genetic changes are among the important risk factors 
associated with predisposing people to diabetes, we examined the role of 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pathogenesis of diabetes among 
Middle East population. In the present review, we assessed the molecular 
pathology of diabetes in the Middle East population that paves the way for 
introducing an efficient SNP-based diagnostic panel for diabetes screening among 
the Middle East population. Since, the Middle East has a population of 370 
million people; the current review can be a reliable model for the introduction 
of SNP-based diagnostic panels in other populations and countries around the 
world.
