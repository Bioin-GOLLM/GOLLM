Morphine stimulates in vitro 3H-UTP incorporation into the nuclei of neurons of 
the superior cervical ganglion and into the hepatocyte nuclei of some rodents. 
This effect is dose-dependent and partially inhibited by naloxone. A synthetic 
analog of enkephalins, D-Ala2-Gly-ol5-enkephalin (DAGO), and beta-endorphin 
stimulate the incorporation of RNA precursors into pre-rRNA. Possible mechanisms 
of morphine action are discussed.
