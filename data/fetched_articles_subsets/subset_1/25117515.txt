The human blood group A and B antigens are synthesized by two highly homologous 
enzymes, glycosyltransferase A (GTA) and glycosyltransferase B (GTB), 
respectively. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of either GalNAc or Gal from 
their corresponding UDP-donors to αFuc1-2βGal-R terminating acceptors. GTA and 
GTB differ at only four of 354 amino acids (R176G, G235S, L266M, G268A), which 
alter the donor specificity from UDP-GalNAc to UDP-Gal. Blood type O individuals 
synthesize truncated or non-functional enzymes. The cloning, crystallization and 
X-ray structure elucidations for GTA and GTB have revealed key residues 
responsible for donor discrimination and acceptor binding. Structural studies 
suggest that numerous conformational changes occur during the catalytic cycle. 
Over 300 ABO alleles are tabulated in the blood group antigen mutation database 
(BGMUT) that provides a framework for structure-function studies. Natural 
mutations are found in all regions of GTA and GTB from the active site, flexible 
loops, stem region and surfaces remote from the active site. Our 
characterizations of natural mutants near a flexible loop (V175M), on a remote 
surface site (P156L), in the metal binding motif (M212V) and near the acceptor 
binding site (L232P) demonstrate the resiliency of GTA and GTB to mutagenesis.
