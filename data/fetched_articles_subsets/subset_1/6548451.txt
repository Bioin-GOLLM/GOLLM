Haemoglobin Warwickshire (beta 5 [A2] Pro----Arg). A possible 'fine tuning' of 
2,3-DPG affinity by beta 5 Pro.

Wilson CI, Cave RJ, Lehmann H, Close M, Imai K.

The blood of a 67-year-old Scotsman who was admitted to hospital with an 
abdominal carcinoma showed an abnormal red cell lysis in the oxidase channel of 
the Technicon H6000 analyser. This is seen regularly with Hb C and sometimes 
with Hb S and on further investigation a new haemoglobin variant--Hb 
Warwickshire--was found. When the family was examined, other examples were 
revealed. The haematological parameters were normal. Hb Warwickshire is mildly 
unstable and whilst in the absence of phosphates its oxygen dissociation does 
not differ from that of Hb A, a small fall of oxygen affinity is noted when 
phosphates are present.
