The aim of the current study was to assess the link between EDN K198N SNP, ET-1 
serum concentration and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in Egyptians. The 
study cohort consisted of 84 patients at AMI onset and 84 age-matched healthy 
controls. Endothelin genotypes and concentrations were determined by sequencing 
and ELISA, respectively. Genotype distribution was not significantly different 
between AMI patients and controls (P=.8341). The mean serum ET-1 concentration 
of patients (13.83±0.7 pg/mL) was significantly higher than controls 
(7.26±0.2 pg/mL) (P<.0001). ET-1 serum concentrations did not vary significantly 
among various EDN genotypes in patients (P=.378) and controls (P=.6164). Hence, 
we conclude that EDN K198N genotypes were not related to either ET-1 
concentration or incidence of early-onset AMI in Egyptians. But, AMI patients 
had higher ET-1 concentrations than controls.
