In this work, new derivatives of biphenyl pyrazole-benzofuran hybrids were 
designed, synthesized and evaluated in vitro through enzymatic assay for 
inhibitory effect against α-glucosidase activity. Newly identified inhibitors 
were found to be four to eighteen folds more active with IC50 values in the 
range of 40.6 ± 0.2-164.3 ± 1.8 µM, as compared to the standard drug acarbose 
(IC50 = 750.0 ± 10.0 μM). Limited Structure-activity relationship was 
established. A kinetic binding study indicated that most active compound 8e 
acted as the competitive inhibitors of α-glucosidase with Ki = 38 μM. Molecular 
docking has also been performed to find the interaction modes responsible for 
the desired inhibitory activity. As expected, all pharmacophoric features, used 
in the design of the hybrid, are involved in the interaction with the active 
site of the enzyme. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations showed compound 
8e oriented vertically into the active site from mouth to the bottom and 
stabilized the enzyme domains by interacting with the interface of domain A and 
domain B and the back side of the active site while acarbose formed non-binding 
interaction with the residue belong to the domain A of the enzyme.
