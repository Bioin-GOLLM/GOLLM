Therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (t-APL) has been reported as a late 
complication of exposure to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapeutic agents 
targeting DNA topoisomerase II. We have analyzed in t-APL novel gene mutations 
recently associated with myeloid disorders. Unlike previous reports in acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), our results showed neither IDHs nor TET2 mutations in 
t-APL. However we found an R882H mutation in the DNMT3A gene in a patient with 
t-APL suggesting a possible role of this alteration in the pathogenesis of 
t-APL.
