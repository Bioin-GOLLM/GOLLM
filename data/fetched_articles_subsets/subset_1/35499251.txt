Neurons are highly susceptible to DNA damage accumulation due to their large 
energy requirements, elevated transcriptional activity, and long lifespan. While 
newer research has shown that DNA breaks and mutations may facilitate neuron 
diversity during development and neuronal function throughout life, a wealth of 
evidence indicates deficient DNA damage repair underlies many neurological 
disorders, especially age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, 
efforts to clarify the molecular link between DNA damage and neurodegeneration 
have improved our understanding of how the genomic location of DNA damage and 
defunct repair proteins impact neuron health. Additionally, work establishing a 
role for senescence in the aging and diseased brain reveals DNA damage may play 
a central role in neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease.
