OBJECTIVE: to describe a case of severe sepsis and complicated bacteremia caused 
by Arcanobacterium haemolyticum and review similar cases in the literature.
CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old gentleman with a history of epilepsy presented with 
symptoms of sore throat, productive cough, periumbilical abdominal pain, watery 
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, subjective fevers along with progressive jaundice 
for seven days. The patient had acute fulminant liver failure, septic shock, and 
Multi-organ failure. He required vasopressors, underwent intubation, and had 
grown Arcanobacterium haemolyticum in the blood and Bronchoalveolar lavage 
samples. He developed a peritonsillar abscess and cavitary pneumonia and 
required chest tube drainage followed by thoracotomy for hemothorax. The patient 
improved on Ampicillin-Sulbactam treatment and was treated with a total 
antibiotic duration of 6 weeks. He fully improved on post-discharge follow-up.
DISCUSSION: Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a Gram-positive (sometimes Gram 
variable), catalase-negative facultatively anaerobic, non-motile, 
non-spore-forming, and variably Î²-hemolytic and is known to be a cause of 
pharyngitis and skin and soft tissue infections. Rarely A. Haemolyticum can be 
associated with severe systemic infections such as infective endocarditis, 
systemic abscesses, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. In previous literature 
reviews, the source of A. haemolyticum depended on the host, and pharyngeal and 
upper respiratory sources were likely to be associated with immunocompetent 
hosts.
CONCLUSION: A. haemolyticum should be included in the differential diagnosis of 
bacterial pharyngitis complicated by severe systemic illness. Penicillins are 
the most commonly used antibiotics for treating A. haemolyticum bacteremia, and 
macrolides can be used for Penicillin's treatment failure.
