POLD1 encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta (PolÎ´), the major 
lagging strand polymerase, which also participates in DNA repair. Mutations 
affecting the exonuclease domain increase the risk of various cancers, while 
mutations that change the polymerase active site cause a progeroid syndrome 
called mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features, and lipodystrophy 
(MDPL) syndrome. We generated a set of catalytic subunit of human telomerase 
(hTERT)-immortalized human fibroblasts expressing wild-type or mutant POLD1 
using the retroviral LXSN vector system. In the resulting cell lines, expression 
of endogenous POLD1 was suppressed in favor of the recombinant POLD1. The siRNA 
screening of DNA damage-related genes revealed that fibroblasts expressing D316H 
and S605del POLD1 were more sensitive to knockdowns of ribonuclease reductase 
(RNR) components, RRM1 and RRM2 in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), an RNR 
inhibitor. On the contrary, SAMHD1 siRNA, which increases the concentration of 
dNTPs, increased growth of wild type, D316H, and S605del POLD1 fibroblasts. 
Hypersensitivity to dNTP synthesis inhibition in POLD1 mutant lines was 
confirmed using gemcitabine. Our finding is consistent with the notion that 
reduced dNTP concentration negatively affects the cell growth of hTERT 
fibroblasts expressing exonuclease and polymerase mutant POLD1.
