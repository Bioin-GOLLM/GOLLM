PURPOSE: To report an unusual episode of full-thickness macular hole 
complicating Stargardt disease with an ABCR mutation.
METHODS: Case report .
RESULTS: Fundus examination of a 20-year-old healthy man showed typical fundus 
manifestation with yellowish-round or fish-like flecks associated with vitreous 
macular adhesion and a round punched-out area in the right eye. Optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) illustrated a full-thickness macular hole. Molecular 
genetic examination of the ABCR gene showed two heterozygous missense mutations: 
R1108C (CGC-->TGC) in exon 22 and a splicing mutation IVS6--> 1GT - described in 
the literature in association with Stargardt disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Macular hole was once described in other inherited retinal 
degenerations (Best disease and Bietti crystal line retinopathy). The 
pathogenesis gives rise to a host of speculations: widespread alteration of the 
retinal pigment epithelium; inflammatory mechanisms; a minor trauma which might 
cause subretinal fibrosis. Surgical procedures were not performed on our patient 
after his ophthalmologic history and findings were considered.
