miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA, is one of the determinants for liver tropism 
of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although miR-122 is required for efficient 
propagation of HCV, we have previously shown that HCV replicates at a low rate 
in miR-122-deficient cells, suggesting that HCV-RNA is capable of propagating in 
an miR-122-independent manner. We herein investigated the roles of miR-122 in 
both the replication of HCV-RNA and the production of infectious particles by 
using miR-122-knockout Huh7 (Huh7-122KO) cells. A slight increase of 
intracellular HCV-RNA levels and infectious titers in the culture supernatants 
was observed in Huh7-122KO cells upon infection with HCV. Moreover, after serial 
passages of HCV in miR-122-knockout Huh7.5.1 cells, we obtained an adaptive 
mutant, HCV122KO, possessing G28A substitution in the 5'UTR of the HCV genotype 
2a JFH1 genome, and this mutant may help to enhance replication complex 
formation, a possibility supported by polysome analysis. We also found the 
introduction of adaptive mutation around miR-122 binding site in the genotype 
1b/2a chimeric virus, which originally had an adenine at the nucleotide position 
29. HCV122KO exhibited efficient RNA replication in miR-122-knockout cells and 
non-hepatic cells without exogenous expression of miR-122. Competition assay 
revealed that the G28A mutant was dominant in the absence of miR-122, but its 
effects were equivalent to those of the wild type in the presence of miR-122, 
suggesting that the G28A mutation does not confer an advantage for propagation 
in miR-122-rich hepatocytes. These observations may explain the clinical finding 
that the positive rate of G28A mutation was higher in miR-122-deficient PBMCs 
than in the patient serum, which mainly included the hepatocyte-derived virus 
from HCV-genotype-2a patients. These results suggest that the emergence of HCV 
mutants that can propagate in non-hepatic cells in an miR-122-independent manner 
may participate in the induction of extrahepatic manifestations in chronic 
hepatitis C patients.
