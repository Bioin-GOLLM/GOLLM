G2019S in LRRK2 is the most common mutation associated with Parkinson's disease 
(PD). Highest frequencies are in North African Arabic (30-41%) and Ashkenazi 
Jewish (6-30%) populations, mostly due to founder effects. Here, we investigated 
the frequency of G2019S in 647 unrelated South African PD patients from 
different ancestral origins. It was found in only 1.2% (8/647) of patients. 
Notably, none of the 91 individuals of African ancestry had G2019S. It was 
present in 1.9% (3/154) and 1% (5/493) of early- and late-onset cases, 
respectively. The frequency of G2019S exhibits ethnic-specific differences and 
warrants further study in sub-Saharan African populations.
