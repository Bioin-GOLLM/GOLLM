BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence that demonstrated the association of 
aberrant NEDD4L expression with diverse human cancers. However, the expression 
pattern and clinical implication of NEDD4L in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
remains poorly defined.
METHODS: We systemically determined NEDD4L expression with its clinical 
significance in AML by both public data and our research cohort. Moreover, 
biological functions of NEDD4L in leukemogenesis were further tested by in vitro 
experiments.
RESULTS: By the public data, we identified that low NEDD4L expression was 
correlated with AML among diverse human cancers. Expression of NEDD4L was 
remarkably decreased in AML compared with controls, and was confirmed by our 
research cohort. Clinically, low expression of NEDD4L was correlated with 
greatly lower age, higher white blood cells, and higher bone marrow/peripheral 
blood blasts. Moreover, NEDD4L underexpression was positively correlated with 
normal karyotype, FLT3 and NPM1 mutations, but negatively associated with 
complex karyotype and TP53 mutations. Importantly, the association between 
NEDD4L expression and survival was also discovered in cytogenetically normal AML 
patients. Finally, a number of 1024 RNAs and 91 microRNAs were identified to be 
linked to NEDD4L expression in AML. Among the negatively correlated microRNAs, 
miR-10a was also discovered as a microRNA that may directly target NEDD4L. 
Further functional studies revealed that NEDD4L exhibited anti-proliferative and 
pro-apoptotic effects in leukemic cell line K562.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that NEDD4L underexpression, as a frequent 
event in AML, was associated with genetic abnormalities and prognosis in AML. 
Moreover, NEDD4L expression may be involved in leukemogenesis with potential 
therapeutic target value.
