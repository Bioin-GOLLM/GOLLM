We present a new model of ESR1 network regulation based on analysis of 
Doxorubicin, Estradiol, and TNFα combination treatment in MCF-7. We used 
Doxorubicin as a therapeutic agent, TNFα as marker and mediator of an 
inflammatory microenvironment and 17β-Estradiol (E2) as an agonist of Estrogen 
Receptors, known predisposing factor for hormone-driven breast cancer, whose 
pharmacological inhibition reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Based 
on the results of transcriptomics analysis, we found 71 differentially expressed 
genes that are specific for the combination treatment with 
Doxorubicin + Estradiol + TNFα in comparison with single or double treatments. 
The responsiveness to the triple treatment was examined for seven genes by qPCR, 
of which six were validated, and then extended to four additional cell lines 
differing for p53 and/or ER status. The results of differential regulation 
enrichment analysis highlight the role of the ESR1 network that included 36 of 
71 specific differentially expressed genes. We propose that the combined 
activation of p53 and NF-kB transcription factors significantly influences 
ligand-dependent, ER-driven transcriptional responses, also of the ESR1 gene 
itself. These results provide a model of coordinated interaction of TFs to 
explain the Doxorubicin, E2 and TNFα induced repression mechanisms.
