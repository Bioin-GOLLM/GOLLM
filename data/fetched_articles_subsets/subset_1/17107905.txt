An increased incidence of HFE gene mutations has been described in hematologic 
malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the allelic frequency of HFE 
gene mutations in 154 adult patients with acute leukemia (AL) [107 acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML), 20 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 27 acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL)]. The allelic frequency of the H63D mutation was 29% in AL 
patients and 25% in the healthy controls [P = 0.41; odds ratio (OR) = 1.20; 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 0.77 - 1.93]. No difference was found between 
controls and AML or APL patients, whereas the H63D mutation was significantly 
more frequent in ALL than controls (44% vs. 25%, P = 0.04; OR = 2.37; 95% CI = 
1.05 - 5.36). The overall comparison of the mutation among the three subtypes of 
AL demonstrated a higher allelic frequency in ALL (P = 0.02). In conclusion, our 
data demonstrate a correlation between the presence of the H63D mutation and the 
occurrence of ALL in adult patients.
