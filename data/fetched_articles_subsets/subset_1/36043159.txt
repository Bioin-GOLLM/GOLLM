OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown that cluster of differentiation (CD) 24 gene 
polymorphism is associated with several diseases. Among these, chronic hepatitis 
B (CHB) infection has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the 
function of CD24 in CHB.
METHODS: The study included 478 cases of CHB and 318 cases without CHB from 230 
families that underwent genotyping. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism was performed to assess the single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) P170 of the CD24 gene. The detected genotypes were TT, CT, 
and CC. Then, family based-association analysis was carried out to investigate 
the association between CD24 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to CHB.
RESULTS: In the 478 patients with CHB, the frequencies of CD24 P170 T and C 
alleles were 35.5% and 64.5%, respectively, and the frequencies of CD24 P170 CC, 
CT, and TT genotypes were 39.3%, 50.4% and 10.3%, respectively. In a CD24 
single-locus analysis by a family-based association test of P170 polymorphisms, 
T and C were not significantly associated with CHB in the additive (Z = 0.169, P 
= 0.866; Z = -0.169, P = 0.866, respectively), dominant (Z = 0.522, P = 0.602; Z 
= 0.428, P = 0.669, respectively), or recessive (Z = -0.428, P = 0.669; Z = 
-0.522, P = 0.602, respectively) models. Transmission-disequilibrium (TD) and 
sib-transmission disequilibrium (STD) tests revealed no excess of T or C alleles 
from heterozygous parents to their children with the disease or higher 
frequencies of these alleles in patients compared with their normal siblings (χ 
2 = 0.06, P = 0.897).
CONCLUSION: The study findings suggest that the SNP P170 of CD24 has no 
significant association with susceptibility to the HB virus and related 
phenotypes in Chinese patients.
