Development of antimalarial compounds into clinical candidates remains costly 
and arduous without detailed knowledge of the target. As resistance increases 
and treatment options at various stages of disease are limited, it is critical 
to identify multistage drug targets that are readily interrogated in biochemical 
assays. Whole-genome sequencing of 18 parasite clones evolved using 
thienopyrimidine compounds with submicromolar, rapid-killing, pan-life cycle 
antiparasitic activity showed that all had acquired mutations in the P. 
falciparum cytoplasmic isoleucyl tRNA synthetase (cIRS). Engineering two of the 
mutations into drug-naïve parasites recapitulated the resistance phenotype, and 
parasites with conditional knockdowns of cIRS became hypersensitive to two 
thienopyrimidines. Purified recombinant P. vivax cIRS inhibition, 
cross-resistance, and biochemical assays indicated a noncompetitive, allosteric 
binding site that is distinct from that of known cIRS inhibitors mupirocin and 
reveromycin A. Our data show that Plasmodium cIRS is an important chemically and 
genetically validated target for next-generation medicines for malaria.
