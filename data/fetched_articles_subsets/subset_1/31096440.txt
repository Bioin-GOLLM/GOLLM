BACKGROUND: The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2476601 of the protein 
tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene has been presented to 
implicate in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata (AA) in a few association 
investigations with limited sample size and inconsistent conclusions.
METHODS: The aim of the current meta-analysis was to assess and synthesize the 
presently available data on the connection between rs2476601 and AA 
vulnerability. Six electronic databases, including EMBASE, PubMed, Web of 
Science, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang data, and the China National Knowledge 
Infrastructure database (CNKI), were systematically retrieved for relevant 
observational studies published previous to November 2018. Total odds ratios 
(ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were analyzed to 
evaluate the correlation between PTPN22 polymorphism and AA. Risk of bias was 
estimated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Sensitivity analyses 
were carried out using the RevMan 5.3 software.
RESULTS: In general, 5 case-control studies including 1129 AA patients and 1702 
healthy control individuals were obtained for this meta-analysis. The pooled 
results suggested that rs2476601 SNP was significantly associated with AA 
susceptibility under allelic model (C vs T, OR = 0.77, 95% CI, 0.64-0.92, 
P = .003) and recessive model (CC vs CT + TT, OR = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.60-0.88, 
P = .001).
CONCLUSION: On the basis of the results of the current research, the rs2476601 
polymorphism of PTPN22 gene is significantly correlated with AA susceptibility. 
The C-allele and CC-genotype carriers at this locus have a lower risk of AA.
