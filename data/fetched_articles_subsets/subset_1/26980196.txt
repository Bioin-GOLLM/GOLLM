Therapies for liver cancer particularly those including radiation are still 
inadequate. Inhibiting the stress response machinery is an appealing anti-cancer 
and radiosensitizing therapeutic strategy. Heat-shock-protein-90 (HSP90) is a 
molecular chaperone that is a prominent effector of the stress response 
machinery and is overexpressed in liver cancer cells. HSP90 client proteins 
include critical components of pathways implicated in liver cancer cell survival 
and radioresistance. The effects of a novel non-geldanamycin HSP90 inhibitor, 
ganetespib, combined with radiation were examined on 3 liver cancer cell lines, 
Hep3b, HepG2 and HUH7, using in vitro assays for clonogenic survival, apoptosis, 
cell cycle distribution, Î³H2AX foci kinetics and client protein expression in 
pathways important for liver cancer survival and radioresistance. We then 
evaluated tumor growth delay and effects of the combined ganetespib-radiation 
treatment on tumor cell proliferation in a HepG2 hind-flank tumor graft model. 
Nanomolar levels of ganetespib alone exhibited liver cancer cell anti-cancer 
activity in vitro as shown by decreased clonogenic survival that was associated 
with increased apoptotic cell death, prominent G2-M arrest and marked changes in 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MAPK client protein activity. Ganetespib caused a 
supra-additive radiosensitization in all liver cancer cell lines at low 
nanomolar doses with enhancement ratios between 1.33-1.78. These results were 
confirmed in vivo, where the ganetespib-radiation combination therapy produced 
supra-additive tumor growth delay compared with either therapy by itself in 
HepG2 tumor grafts. Our data suggest that combined ganetespib-radiation therapy 
exhibits promising activity against liver cancer cells, which should be 
investigated in clinical studies.
