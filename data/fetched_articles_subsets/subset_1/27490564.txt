Globally eliminating measles using available vaccines is biologically feasible 
because the measles virus (MV) hemagglutinin (H) protein is antigenically 
stable. The H protein is responsible for receptor binding, and is the main 
target of neutralizing antibodies. The immunodominant epitope, known as the 
hemagglutinating and noose epitope, is located near the receptor-binding site 
(RBS). The RBS also contains an immunodominant epitope. Loss of receptor binding 
correlates with an escape from the neutralization by antibodies that target the 
epitope at RBS. Another neutralizing epitope is located near RBS and is shielded 
by an N-linked sugar in certain genotype strains. However, human sera from 
vaccinees and measles patients neutralized all MV strains with similar 
efficiencies, regardless of the N-linked sugar modification or mutations at 
these epitopes. Two other major epitopes exist at a distance from RBS. One has 
an unstructured flexible domain with a linear neutralizing epitope. When MV-H 
forms a tetramer (dimer of dimers), these epitopes may form the dimer-dimer 
interface, and one of the two epitopes may also interact with the F protein. The 
neutralization mechanisms of antibodies that recognize these epitopes may 
involve inhibiting the H-F interaction or blocking the fusion cascade after MV-H 
binds to its receptors.
