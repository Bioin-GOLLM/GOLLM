A sister and brother with severe porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase deficiency are 
described. Each of their parents carries a different mutation for acute 
intermittent porphyria and the children are homozygous for the PBG-deaminase 
deficiency that causes this disorder. Both are compound heterozygotes for 
adjacent base transitions in the same codon in exon 10 of the PBG deaminase 
gene.
