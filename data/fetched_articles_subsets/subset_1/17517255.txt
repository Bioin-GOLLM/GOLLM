Genetic abnormalities of pulmonary surfactant were identified by DNA sequence 
analysis in 14 (12 full-term, 2 preterm) of 17 newborn infants with fatal 
respiratory distress of unknown etiology. Deficiency of adenosine 
triphosphate-binding cassette protein, member A3 (n = 12) was a more frequent 
cause of this phenotype than deficiency of surfactant protein B (n = 2).
