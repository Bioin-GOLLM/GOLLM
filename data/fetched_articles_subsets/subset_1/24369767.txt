BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc (IVD) cells experience a broad range of 
physicochemical stimuli under physiologic conditions, including alterations in 
their osmotic environment. At present, the molecular mechanisms underlying 
osmotic regulation in IVD cells are poorly understood. This study aims to screen 
genes affected by changes in osmotic pressure in cells of subjects aged 29 to 63 
years old, with top-scoring pair (TSP) method.
METHODS: Gene expression data set GSE1648 was downloaded from Gene Expression 
Omnibus database, including four hyper-osmotic stimuli samples, four iso-osmotic 
stimuli samples, and three hypo-osmotic stimuli samples. A novel, simple method, 
referred to as the TSP, was used in this study. Through this method, there was 
no need to perform data normalization and transformation before data analysis.
RESULTS: A total of five pairs of genes ((CYP2A6, FNTB), (PRPF8, TARDBP), (RPS5, 
OAZ1), (SLC25A3, NPM1) and (CBX3, SRSF9)) were selected based on the TSP method. 
We inferred that all these genes might play important roles in response to 
osmotic stimuli and age in IVD cells. Additionally, hyper-osmotic and 
iso-osmotic stimuli conditions were adverse factors for IVD cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that our results will provide new thoughts and 
methods for the study of IVD disease.
