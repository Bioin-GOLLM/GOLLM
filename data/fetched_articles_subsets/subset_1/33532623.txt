AIMS: The relationship between HbA1c and diabetic retinopathy is expected to 
differ between different races. In this study, we verified which of HbA1c and 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is more effective for detecting the diabetic 
retinopathy longitudinally in a Japanese population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study subjects underwent health examinations twice 
(including eye test and questionnaire of lifestyle and health) in 2008-2009 
(baseline) and in 2012-2013 (4-year follow-up). Both non-DM and DM patients at 
baseline were included as the participants. Of these participants, who had not 
been diagnosed with retinopathy at the baseline survey (n = 2427; 2150 men and 
277 women) had eye fundus photographs taken four years later (follow-up survey). 
The odds ratios of incidence of retinopathy according to the eight groups of FPG 
and HbA1c were estimated using multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted 
for sex and age. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to evaluate 
each value associated with the presence or absence of retinopathy.
RESULTS: The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of incidence of retinopathy 
by HbA1c level categories, in ascending order, were 1.0 (ref.), 5.66 
(1.14-28.26), 1.69 (0.24-12.04), 3.03 (0.50-18.28), 1.04 (0.09-11.59), 4.73 
(0.78-28.69), 4.12 (0.74-22.85) and 24.47 (5.61-106.75). For both FPG and HbA1c 
levels, the odds ratio for the development of retinopathy increased linearly 
with the increases in the levels FPG and HbA1c, and no clear threshold was 
observed. The AUC values (SE) for FPG and HbA1c were almost the same, at 0.750 
(0.046) and 0.732 (0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: It was clarified that the higher the level of FPG and HbA1c was, 
the higher the incidence of retinopathy after 4 years was. There was no clear 
threshold. The detection ability of the incidence of retinopathy was almost the 
same between FPG and HbA1c, suggesting it is possible to detect the risk of 
retinopathy by HbA1c only.
