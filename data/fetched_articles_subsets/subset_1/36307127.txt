The core promoter plays an essential role in regulating transcription initiation 
by controlling the interaction between transcriptional factors and sequence 
motifs in the core promoter. Although mutation in core promoter sequences is 
expected to cause abnormal gene expression leading to pathogenic consequences, 
limited supporting evidence showed the involvement of core promoter mutation in 
diseases. Our previous study showed that the core promoter is highly polymorphic 
in worldwide human ethnic populations in reflecting human history and 
adaptation. Our recent characterization of the core promoter in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC), a subtype of breast cancer, in a Chinese TNBC cohort 
revealed the wide presence of core promoter mutation in TNBC. In the current 
study, we analyzed the core promoter in a Thai TNBC cohort. We also observed 
rich core promoter mutation in the Thai TNBC patients. We compared the core 
promoter mutations between Chinese and Thai TNBC cohorts. We observed 
substantial differences of core promoter mutation in TNBC between the two 
cohorts, as reflected by the mutation spectrum, mutation-effected gene and 
functional category, and altered gene expression. Our study confirmed that the 
core promoter in TNBC is highly mutable, and is highly ethnic-specific.
