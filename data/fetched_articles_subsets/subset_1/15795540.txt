Screening of 200 blood donors for the presence of polymorphisms in three 
fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB, FGG), revealed two individuals with a heterozygous 
missense mutation (c.323C > G, gammaAla82Gly) in the FGG gene. This mutation has 
been reported previously to cause mild hypofibrinogenaemia. Analysis of an 
additional 416 blood donors showed two more heterozygous gammaAla82Gly 
mutations, resulting in an overall gammaAla82Gly allele frequency of 0.0032. 
Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the gammaAla82Gly mutation originated from 
a common founder. From these data we estimated that homozygous individuals for 
gammaAla82Gly should occur at a frequency of 1: 95 000, suggesting that 
hypofibrinogenaemia represents a more frequent condition in the population than 
so far believed.
