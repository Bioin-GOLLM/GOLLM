Germline pathogenic variants in the BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene cause 
the BAP1-tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS, OMIM 614327). BAP1-TPDS is 
associated with an increased risk of developing uveal melanoma (UM), cutaneous 
melanoma (CM), malignant mesothelioma (MMe), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 
meningioma, cholangiocarcinoma, multiple non-melanoma skin cancers, and 
BAP1-inactivated nevi. Because of this increased risk, it is important to 
identify patients with BAP1-TPDS. The associated tumors are treated by different 
medical disciplines, emphasizing the need for generally applicable guidelines 
for initiating genetic analysis. In this study, we describe the path to 
identification of BAP1-TPDS in 21 probands found in the Netherlands and the 
family history at the time of presentation. We report two cases of de novo BAP1 
germline mutations (2/21, 9.5%). Findings of this study combined with previously 
published literature, led to a proposal of guidelines for genetic referral. We 
recommend genetic analysis in patients with â‰¥2 BAP1-TPDS-associated tumors in 
their medical history and/or family history. We also propose to test germline 
BAP1 in patients diagnosed with UM <40 years, CM <18 years, MMe <50 years, or 
RCC <46 years. Furthermore, other candidate susceptibility genes for tumor types 
associated with BAP1-TPDS are discussed, which can be included in gene panels 
when testing patients.
