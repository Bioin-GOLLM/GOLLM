The 18kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) is the most commonly used tissue-specific 
marker of inflammation in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. It is 
expressed in myeloid cells such as microglia and macrophages, and in rodent 
myeloid cells expression increases with cellular activation. We assessed the 
effect of myeloid cell activation on TSPO gene expression in both primary human 
and rodent microglia and macrophages in vitro, and also measured TSPO 
radioligand binding with 3H-PBR28 in primary human macrophages. As observed 
previously, we found that TSPO expression increases (∼9-fold) in rodent-derived 
macrophages and microglia upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. However, TSPO 
expression does not increase with classical pro-inflammatory activation in 
primary human microglia (fold change 0.85 [95% CI 0.58-1.12], p = 0.47). In 
contrast, pro-inflammatory activation of human monocyte-derived macrophages is 
associated with a reduction of both TSPO gene expression (fold change 0.60 [95% 
CI 0.45-0.74], p = 0.02) and TSPO binding site abundance (fold change 0.61 [95% 
CI 0.49-0.73], p < 0.0001). These findings have important implications for 
understanding the biology of TSPO in activated macrophages and microglia in 
humans. They are also clinically relevant for the interpretation of PET studies 
using TSPO targeting radioligands, as they suggest changes in TSPO expression 
may reflect microglial and macrophage density rather than activation phenotype.
