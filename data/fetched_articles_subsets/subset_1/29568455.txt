Multifunctional polymer-inorganic Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) that simultaneously 
have therapeutic and imaging functions are highly desired in biomedical 
applications. Here, we fabricated spherical polydopamine/mesoporous calcium 
phosphate hollow JNPs (PDA/mCaP H-JNPs) via a novel and facile approach. The 
obtained PDA/mCaP H-JNPs were further selectively functionalized with 
indocyanine green (ICG) and methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)thiol (PEG-SH) on PDA 
domains to achieve a superior photoacoustic (PA) imaging capability and 
stability, while the other mCaP sides with hollow cavities served as storage 
spaces and passages for the anti-cancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The resultant 
PEG-ICG-PDA/mCaP H-JNPs possess excellent biocompatibility, a competent drug 
loading capability, high photothermal conversion efficiency, strong 
near-infrared (NIR) absorbance, and pH/NIR dual-responsive properties, enabling 
the H-JNPs to be applied for PA imaging-guided synergistic cancer 
chemo-phototherapy in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the synthetic approach 
could be extended to prepare PDA/various mesoporous inorganic H-JNPs with 
spherical shapes for specific applications.
