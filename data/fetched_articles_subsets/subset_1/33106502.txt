Slug (SNAI2), a member of the well-conserved Snail family of transcription 
factors, has multiple developmental roles, including in 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we show that Slug is critical 
for the pathological angiogenesis needed to sustain tumor growth, and 
transiently necessary for normal developmental angiogenesis. We find that Slug 
upregulation in angiogenic endothelial cells (EC) regulates an EMT-like suite of 
target genes, and suppresses Dll4-Notch signaling thereby promoting VEGFR2 
expression. Both EC-specific Slug re-expression and reduced Notch signaling, 
either by γ-secretase inhibition or loss of Dll4, rescue retinal angiogenesis in 
SlugKO mice. Conversely, inhibition of VEGF signaling prevents excessive 
angiogenic sprouting of Slug overexpressing EC. Finally, endothelial Slug (but 
not Snail) is activated by the pro-angiogenic factor SDF1α via its canonical 
receptor CXCR4 and the MAP kinase ERK5. Altogether, our data support a critical 
role for Slug in determining the angiogenic response during development and 
disease.
