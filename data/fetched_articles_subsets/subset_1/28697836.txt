OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the genetic polymorphism of 
IL-6 C-572G and susceptibility to spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB).
METHODS: The subjects were from Beijing and the surrounding areas of Beijing. 
This case-control study enrolled 569 SPTB infants, including 56 extremely 
preterm (<28 weeks of gestation), 166 very preterm (28-31+6 weeks of gestation) 
and 347 moderate to late preterm infants (32 to 36+6 weeks of gestation). A 
total of 673 term infants were enrolled as the control group. The latest 
Sequenom MassARRAY®SNP detection technique was used for the typing of single 
nucleotide polymorphism of IL-6 C-572G.
RESULTS: Compared with the CC genotypes, the IL-6 C-572G G-positive genotype 
(CG+GG genotype) was significantly associated with an increased susceptibility 
to moderate to late SPTB (OR=1.35, 95%CI: 1.01-1.80, P=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Among the Chinese population, IL-6 C-572G polymorphism is 
associated with susceptibility to moderate to late SPTB.

目的: 探讨IL-6基因C-572G多态性位点与自发性早产（SPTB）遗传易感性的关联性。
方法: 研究对象来自北京及其周边地区。病例组包括569例SPTB新生儿，其中超早产儿（胎龄 < 
28周）56例、极早产儿（胎龄28~31+6周）166例和中晚期早产儿（胎龄32~36+6周）347例。对照组包括673例足月新生儿。采用最新的Sequenom 
MassARRAY®SNP检测技术对IL-6基因C-572G位点进行单核苷酸多态性分型。
结果: 
与携带IL-6基因C-572G位点的CC基因型的个体相比，携带至少1个G等位基因型（CG+GG基因型）的个体发生中晚期SPTB的风险显著升高（OR=1.35，95%CI：1.01~1.80，P=0.04）。
结论: 在该中国人群中，IL-6基因C-572G多态性位点与中晚期SPTB患病风险的增加存在显著的遗传学关联。
