BACKGROUND: The vast ecosystem of single-cell RNA-sequencing tools has until 
recently been plagued by an excess of diverging analysis strategies, 
inconsistent file formats, and compatibility issues between different software 
suites. The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, 
and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing 
requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and 
understand these ever-growing datasets.
RESULTS: Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for 
single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis 
environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the 
knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. 
The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and 
trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but 
also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and 
full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of 
high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: 
inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The 
teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access 
to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.
CONCLUSIONS: The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a 
sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible 
analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy 
Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy 
community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell 
RNA-sequencing analysis.
