The study involving 2830 subjects (1444 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
and 1386 healthy controls) an association of the rs1046495 polymorphism of the 
GFER gene encoding FADdependent sulfhydryl oxidase with low risk of the disease 
in non-obese patients (OR=0.76, 95%CI 0.57-0.99, p=0.029). The protective effect 
of the polymorphic gene variant remained significant in individuals who consumed 
fresh vegetables and fruits (p=0.014), proteins (p=0.0017), and did not consume 
carbohydrate- and fat-reach food (p=0.0047). The association of the minor allele 
rs1046495-C with type 2 diabetes mellitus can be explained by its more 
pronounced effect on the expression of the GFER enzyme that through 
glutathionation maintains the ROS level for optimal functioning of complexes III 
and IV of the electron transport chain and promotes the formation of disulfide 
bonds in the CHCHD4 chaperone molecule. Impaired activity of this molecule 
underlies mitochondrial dysfunction, one of the key pathological changes in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
