INTRODUCTION: Progressive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts 
for about 80-85% of all lung cancers. Approximately 10-50% of patients with 
NSCLC harbor targetable activating mutations, such as in-frame deletions in Exon 
19 (Ex19del) of EGFR. Currently, for patients with advanced NSCLC, testing for 
sensitizing mutations in EGFR is mandatory prior to the administration of 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma was collected from patients with NSCLC. We carried 
out targeted NGS using the Plasma-SeqSensei™ SOLID CANCER IVD kit on cfDNA 
(circulating free DNA). Clinical concordance for plasma detection of known 
oncogenic drivers was reported. In a subset of cases, validation was carried out 
using an orthogonal OncoBEAMTM EGFR V2 assay, as well as with our custom 
validated NGS assay. Somatic alterations were filtered, removing somatic 
mutations attributable to clonal hematopoiesis for our custom validated NGS 
assay.
RESULTS: In the plasma samples, driver targetable mutations were studied, with a 
mutant allele frequency (MAF) ranging from 0.00% (negative detection) to 82.25%, 
using the targeted next-generation sequencing Plasma-SeqSensei™ SOLID CANCER IVD 
Kit. In comparison with the OncoBEAMTM EGFR V2 kit, the EGFR concordance is 
89.16% (based on the common genomic regions). The sensitivity and specificity 
rates based on the genomic regions (EGFR exons 18, 19, 20, and 21) were 84.62% 
and 94.67%. Furthermore, the observed clinical genomic discordances were present 
in 25% of the samples: 5% in those linked to the lower of coverage of the 
OncoBEAMTM EGFR V2 kit, 7% in those induced by the sensitivity limit on the EGFR 
with the Plasma-SeqSensei™ SOLID CANCER IVD Kit, and 13% in the samples linked 
to the larger KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF coverage of the Plasma-SeqSensei™ SOLID CANCER 
IVD kit. Most of these somatic alterations were cross validated in our 
orthogonal custom validated NGS assay, used in the routine management of 
patients. The concordance is 82.19% in the common genomic regions (EGFR exons 
18, 19, 20, 21; KRAS exons 2, 3, 4; BRAF exons 11, 15; and PIK3CA exons 10, 21). 
The sensitivity and specificity rates were 89.38% and 76.12%, respectively. The 
32% of genomic discordances were composed of 5% caused by the limit of coverage 
of the Plasma-SeqSensei™ SOLID CANCER IVD kit, 11% induced by the sensitivity 
limit of our custom validated NGS assay, and 16% linked to the additional 
oncodriver analysis, which is only covered by our custom validated NGS assay.
CONCLUSIONS: The Plasma-SeqSensei™ SOLID CANCER IVD kit resulted in de novo 
detection of targetable oncogenic drivers and resistance alterations, with a 
high sensitivity and accuracy for low and high cfDNA inputs. Thus, this assay is 
a sensitive, robust, and accurate test.
