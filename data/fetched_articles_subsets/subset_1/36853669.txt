Here, we provide an optimized protocol to observe the interactions between 
infiltrating immune cells and islet β cells using live imaging. This protocol is 
useful for the characterization of cell-cell interactions and for the direct 
visualization of immune cell migration to the principal pancreatic islet during 
islet inflammation. We describe the preparation of zebrafish transgenic lines 
and detail steps for setting up the fish for live confocal imaging. For more 
details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Yang et al.
