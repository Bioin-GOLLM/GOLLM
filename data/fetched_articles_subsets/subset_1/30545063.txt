Influenza A viruses (IAV) can infect a broad range of animal hosts, including 
humans. In humans, IAV causes seasonal annual epidemics and occasional 
pandemics, representing a serious public health and economic problem, which is 
most effectively prevented through vaccination. The defense mechanisms that the 
host innate immune system provides restrict IAV replication and infection. 
Consequently, to successfully replicate in interferon (IFN)-competent systems, 
IAV has to counteract host antiviral activities, mainly the production of IFN 
and the activities of IFN-induced host proteins that inhibit virus replication. 
The IAV multifunctional proteins PA-X and NS1 are virulence factors that 
modulate the innate immune response and virus pathogenicity. Notably, these two 
viral proteins have synergistic effects in the inhibition of host protein 
synthesis in infected cells, although using different mechanisms of action. 
Moreover, the control of innate immune responses by the IAV NS1 and PA-X 
proteins is subject to a balance that can determine virus pathogenesis and 
fitness, and recent evidence shows co-evolution of these proteins in seasonal 
viruses, indicating that they should be monitored for enhanced virulence. 
Importantly, inhibition of host gene expression by the influenza NS1 and/or PA-X 
proteins could be explored to develop improved live-attenuated influenza 
vaccines (LAIV) by modulating the ability of the virus to counteract antiviral 
host responses. Likewise, both viral proteins represent a reasonable target for 
the development of new antivirals for the control of IAV infections. In this 
review, we summarize the role of IAV NS1 and PA-X in controlling the antiviral 
response during viral infection.
