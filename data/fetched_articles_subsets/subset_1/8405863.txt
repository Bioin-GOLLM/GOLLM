BACKGROUND: A precore defective hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant unable to produce 
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) has been associated with fulminant hepatitis B. We 
have studied the etiologic contribution of precore mutants among North American 
patients with this disorder.
METHODS: We studied 39 patients with fulminant hepatitis B. The precore and 
proximal core regions of HBV from 37 of 39 patients were sequenced.
RESULTS: Four patients (10.8%) harbored nonsense mutants likely to produce an 
HBeAg negative HBV infection; two such mutants had a G to A substitution at 
position 1896, one lost the precore initiation codon, and one harbored a stop 
codon immediately downstream of the precore initiation codon. Recovered 
sequences from seven additional patients displayed silent or missense mutations 
in these regions. All delta coinfected patients harbored known wild type strains 
of HBV. A significantly poorer survival was associated with antibody to HBe 
positivity and presence of nucleotide substitutions in the precore/core region.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of precore mutations in 37 patients from the United 
States was lower than reported elsewhere; only two patients were found to have 
the G to A transition mutation in the precore region at position 1896. We 
conclude that HBeAg negative HBV mutants do not play a predominant etiologic 
role among North American patients with fulminant hepatitis B.
