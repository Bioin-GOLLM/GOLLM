We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
(ELX/TEZ/IVA) in three subjects carrying the Phe508del/unknown CFTR genotype. An 
ex vivo analysis on nasal epithelial cells (NEC) indicated a significant 
improvement of CFTR gating activity after the treatment. Three patients were 
enrolled in an ELX/TEZ/IVA managed-access program, including subjects with the 
highest percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in the 1st second (ppFEV1) < 
40 in the preceding 3 months. Data were collected at baseline and after 8, 12 
and 24 weeks of follow-up during treatment. All patients showed a considerable 
decrease of sweat chloride (i.e., meanly about 60 mmol/L as compared to 
baseline), relevant improvement of ppFEV1 (i.e., >8) and six-minute walk test, 
and an increase in body mass index after the first 8 weeks of treatment. No 
pulmonary exacerbations occurred during the 24 weeks of treatment and all 
domains of the CF Questionnaire-Revised improved. No safety concerns related to 
the treatment occurred. This study demonstrates the benefit from the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment in patients with CF with the Phe508del and one unidentified CFTR 
variant. The preliminary ex vivo analysis of the drug response on NEC helps to 
predict the in vivo therapeutic endpoints.
