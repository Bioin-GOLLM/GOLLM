Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and incidences are rising 
rapidly, in both pediatric and adult populations. Many thyroid tumors are 
successfully treated which results in low mortality rates, but there is often a 
significant morbidity associated with thyroid cancer treatments. For patients 
with tumors that are not successfully treated with surgical resection or 
radioactive iodine treatment, prognosis is dramatically reduced. Patients 
diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer face a very grim prognosis with a 
median survival of 6Â months post-diagnosis. There is a critical need to identify 
patients who are at greatest risk of developing persistent disease and 
progressing to poorly differentiated or anaplastic disease. Furthermore, 
development of treatments associated with less morbidity would represent a 
significant improvement for thyroid cancer survivors. It is well established the 
stromal cells and components of the tumor microenvironment can drive tumor 
progression and resistance to therapy. Here we review the current state of what 
is known regarding the thyroid tumor microenvironment and how these factors may 
contribute to thyroid tumor pathogenesis. Study of the tumor microenvironment 
within thyroid cancer is a relatively new field, and more studies are needed to 
dissect the complex and dynamic crosstalk between thyroid tumor cells and its 
tumor niche.
