Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones that regulate a variety of 
physiologic processes and are essential for life. The actions of glucocorticoids 
are predominantly mediated through the classic glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GRs 
are expressed throughout the body, but there is considerable heterogeneity in 
glucocorticoid sensitivity and biologic responses across tissues. The 
conventional belief that glucocorticoids act through a single GR protein has 
changed dramatically with the discovery of a diverse collection of receptor 
isoforms. This article provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms that 
regulate glucocorticoid actions, highlights the dynamic nature of hormone 
signaling, and discusses the molecular properties of the GR isoforms.
