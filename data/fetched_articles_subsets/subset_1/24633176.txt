The formation of synapses, the specialized points of chemical communication 
between neurons, is a highly regulated developmental process fundamental to 
establishing normal brain circuitry. Perturbations of synapse formation and 
function causally contribute to human developmental and degenerative 
neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, intellectual 
disability, and autism spectrum disorders. Many genes controlling synaptogenesis 
have been identified, but lack of facile experimental systems has made 
systematic discovery of regulators of synaptogenesis challenging. Thus, we 
created a high-throughput platform to study excitatory and inhibitory synapse 
development in primary neuronal cultures and used a lentiviral RNA interference 
library to identify novel regulators of synapse formation. This methodology is 
broadly applicable for high-throughput screening of genes and drugs that may 
rescue or improve synaptic dysfunction associated with cognitive function and 
neurological disorders.
