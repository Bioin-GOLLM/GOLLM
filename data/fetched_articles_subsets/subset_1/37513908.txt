Cyclic peptides are molecules that are already used as drugs in therapies 
approved for various pharmacological activities, for example, as antibiotics, 
antifungals, anticancer, and immunosuppressants. Interest in these molecules has 
been growing due to the improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties 
of the cyclic structure over linear peptides and by the evolution of chemical 
synthesis, computational, and in vitro methods. To date, 53 cyclic peptides have 
been approved by different regulatory authorities, and many others are in 
clinical trials for a wide diversity of conditions. In this review, the 
potential of cyclic peptides is presented, and general aspects of their 
synthesis and development are discussed. Furthermore, an overview of already 
approved cyclic peptides is also given, and the cyclic peptides in clinical 
trials are summarized.
