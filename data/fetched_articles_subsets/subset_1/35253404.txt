Immunotherapy with toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG ODN offers an 
emergent strategy to treat life-threatening malignant glioma. CpG is typically 
applied invasively by intracranial and intrathecal administration which induces 
not only poor compliance and lessened potency but also possibly strong adverse 
effects and immunotoxicity. Here, it is reported that immunotherapy of murine 
LCPN glioma is greatly boosted by polymersome-steered intravenous and intranasal 
brain delivery of CpG. CpG is efficiently loaded in apolipoprotein E 
peptide-directed polymersomes to give blood-brain barrier permeable and glioma 
and cervical lymph node-homing CpG nano-immunoadjuvant (t-NanoCpG) which 
strongly stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, antigen 
cross-presentation, and production of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo. 
Intriguingly, both intravenous and intranasal administration of t-NanoCpG brings 
about significant survival benefits in murine LCPN glioma-bearing mice while 
free CpG and nontargeted CpG nano-immunoadjuvant (NanoCpG) afford modest 
therapeutic effects. Moreover, combination of t-NanoCpG with radiotherapy 
further boosts the immunotherapeutic effects leading to more improved survival 
rate of mice. This intelligent brain-permeable nano-immunoadjuvant provides a 
new, minimally invasive and highly potent strategy for immunotherapy of glioma.
