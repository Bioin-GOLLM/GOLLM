DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid)-based chelates 
that give only a single isomer in solution when complexed with lanthanide (Ln3+) 
ions is of value for studying protein dynamics and interactions via NMR. Herein, 
we have investigated the geometries, energetics, and electrostatic potentials of 
Lu complexed with DOTA (1), ring methylated M4DOTA (2), and arm methylated 
R-DOTMA (3) and S-DOTMA (4), as well as, both ring and arm methylated 
4S-4S-M4DOTMA (5) and 4S-4R-M4DOTMA (6) at the level of M06-L/6-31+G(d)-SDD, to 
elucidate the origin of the isomer stability. These analyses indicate that the 
electrostatic repulsion between the arm methyl and the neighboring carboxylate 
significantly destabilizes the square antiprism (SAP) isomer of Lu-5 and the 
twisted square antiprism (TSAP) isomer of Lu-6, while the steric repulsion 
between the ring and arm methyl groups attenuates the stability of both TSAP of 
Lu-5 and SAP of Lu-6. To rationalize the variable temperature proton NMR 
spectra, the energy barriers for the inter-conversion in Lu-5 and Lu-6 via arm 
rotation were also calculated. The modulation of the stability and rigidity of 
Ln complexes via a modification of DOTA is also discussed. Our investigation 
will aid to design better chelates for the Ln3+ ions for its use in molecular 
medicine.
