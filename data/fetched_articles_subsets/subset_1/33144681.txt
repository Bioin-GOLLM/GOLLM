PURPOSE: Pathogenic variants in the X-linked gene NEXMIF (previously KIAA2022) 
are associated with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder, and 
epilepsy. We aimed to delineate the female and male phenotypic spectrum of 
NEXMIF encephalopathy.
METHODS: Through an international collaboration, we analyzed the phenotypes and 
genotypes of 87 patients with NEXMIF encephalopathy.
RESULTS: Sixty-three females and 24 males (46 new patients) with NEXMIF 
encephalopathy were studied, with 30 novel variants. Phenotypic features 
included developmental delay/ID in 86/87 (99%), seizures in 71/86 (83%) and 
multiple comorbidities. Generalized seizures predominated including myoclonic 
seizures and absence seizures (both 46/70, 66%), absence with eyelid myoclonia 
(17/70, 24%), and atonic seizures (30/70, 43%). Males had more severe 
developmental impairment; females had epilepsy more frequently, and varied from 
unaffected to severely affected. All NEXMIF pathogenic variants led to a 
premature stop codon or were deleterious structural variants. Most arose de 
novo, although X-linked segregation occurred for both sexes. Somatic mosaicism 
occurred in two males and a family with suspected parental mosaicism.
CONCLUSION: NEXMIF encephalopathy is an X-linked, generalized developmental and 
epileptic encephalopathy characterized by myoclonic-atonic epilepsy overlapping 
with eyelid myoclonia with absence. Some patients have developmental 
encephalopathy without epilepsy. Males have more severe developmental 
impairment. NEXMIF encephalopathy arises due to loss-of-function variants.
