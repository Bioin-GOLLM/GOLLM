Uterine PEComatosis With TSC1 Mutation in a Patient With Tuberous Sclerosis: 
Case Report and Literature Review.

Schechter SA, Udager AM, Skala SL.

Uterine PEComatosis is a rare phenomenon characterized by the presence of 
multiple perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and/or microscopic 
proliferations of perivascular epithelioid cells. Herein, we report a case of 
PEComatosis arising in a 49-yr-old woman with a known history of tuberous 
sclerosis. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed a TSC1 stopgain mutation 
(p.Q732X) in all tested nodules, with single-copy TSC1 loss or copy-neutral TSC1 
loss of heterozygosity. To our knowledge, this is the second report of TSC1 
inactivation in uterine PEComa and the first report of confirmed TSC1 
abnormalities in PEComatosis.
