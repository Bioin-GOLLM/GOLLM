BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) is a structural protein of high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol; ApoA1 is involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism. 
This study evaluated the association of ApoA1 polymorphism (rs5070) with 
different stroke subtypes in Taiwanese individuals.
METHODS: A total of 2139 cases, including 614 controls and 708 large artery 
atherosclerosis (LAA), 377 small-vessel occlusion, and 440 hypertensive 
intracranial hemorrhage cases, were enrolled in this study. ApoA1 polymorphism 
was genotyped through polymerase chain reaction amplification and then subjected 
to mass-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
using a Bruker SNP genotyping system in the National Center for Genome Medicine 
(Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; http://ncgm.sinica.edu.tw/).
RESULTS: The frequency of ApoA1 rs5070 dominant genotype (AA vs. AG+GG) was not 
significantly different among LAA, small-vessel occlusion, and hypertensive 
intracranial hemorrhage groups compared with that of the control group. Compared 
with diabetic patients with the AA allele, those with the AG+GG allele of ApoA1 
rs5070 polymorphism showed a 1.58-fold likelihood of developing LAA (odds 
ratio=1.58; 95% confidence interval=1.00-2.42; p=0.046), but not small-vessel 
occlusion or hypertensive intracranial hemorrhage. In male diabetic patients, 
the odds ratio increased to 1.90-fold.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that genetic polymorphisms of ApoA1 rs5070 
A/G may play a role in the susceptibility to LAA among male diabetic patients.
