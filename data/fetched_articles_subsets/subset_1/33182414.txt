The final obstacle to achieving a cure to HIV/AIDS is the presence of latent HIV 
reservoirs scattered throughout the body. Although antiretroviral therapy 
maintains plasma viral loads below the levels of detection, upon cessation of 
therapy, the latent reservoir immediately produces infectious progeny viruses. 
This results in elevated plasma viremia, which leads to clinical progression to 
AIDS. Thus, if a HIV cure is ever to become a reality, it will be necessary to 
target and eliminate the latent reservoir. To this end, tremendous effort has 
been dedicated to locate the viral reservoir, understand the mechanisms 
contributing to latency, find optimal methods to reactivate HIV, and 
specifically kill latently infected cells. Although we have not yet identified a 
therapeutic approach to completely eliminate HIV from patients, these efforts 
have provided many technological breakthroughs in understanding the underlying 
mechanisms that regulate HIV latency and reactivation in vitro. In this review, 
we summarize and compare experimental systems which are frequently used to study 
HIV latency. While none of these models are a perfect proxy for the complex 
systems at work in HIV+ patients, each aim to replicate HIV latency in vitro.
