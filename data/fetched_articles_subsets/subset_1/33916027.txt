Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), a proenzyme, is converted to 
a potent attenuator of the fibrinolytic system upon activation by thrombin, 
plasmin, or the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex. Since TAFI forms a molecular 
link between coagulation and fibrinolysis and plays a potential role in venous 
and arterial thrombotic diseases, much interest has been tied to the development 
of molecules that antagonize its function. This review aims at providing a 
general overview on the biochemical properties of TAFI, its (patho)physiologic 
function, and various strategies to stimulate the fibrinolytic system by 
interfering with (activated) TAFI functionality.
