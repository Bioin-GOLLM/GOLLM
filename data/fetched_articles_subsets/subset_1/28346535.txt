BACKGROUND: The neuropsychological consequences of exposure to environmental 
hypobaric hypoxia (EHH) remain unclear. We thus investigated them in a large 
group of healthy volunteers who trekked to Mount Everest base camp (5,300 m).
METHODS: A neuropsychological (NP) test battery assessing memory, language, 
attention, and executive function was administered to 198 participants (age 
44.5±13.7 years; 60% male). These were studied at baseline (sea level), 3,500 m 
(Namche Bazaar), 5,300 m (Everest Base Camp) and on return to 1,300 m 
(Kathmandu) (attrition rate 23.7%). A comparable control group (n = 25; age 
44.5±14.1 years; 60% male) for comparison with trekkers was tested at/or near 
sea level over an equivalent timeframe so as to account for learning effects 
associated with repeat testing. The Reliable Change Index (RCI) was used to 
calculate changes in cognition and neuropsychological function during and after 
exposure to EHH relative to controls.
RESULTS: Overall, attention, verbal ability and executive function declined in 
those exposed to EHH when the performance of the control group was taken into 
account (RCI .05 to -.95) with decline persisting at descent. Memory and 
psychomotor function showed decline at highest ascent only (RCI -.08 to -.56). 
However, there was inter-individual variability in response: whilst NP 
performance declined in most, this improved in some trekkers. Cognitive decline 
was greater amongst older people (r = .42; p < .0001), but was otherwise not 
consistently associated with socio-demographic, mood, or physiological 
variables.
CONCLUSIONS: After correcting for learning effects, attention, verbal abilities 
and executive functioning declined with exposure to EHH. There was considerable 
individual variability in the response of brain function to sustained hypoxia 
with some participants not showing any effects of hypoxia. This might have 
implications for those facing sustained hypoxia as a result of any disease.
