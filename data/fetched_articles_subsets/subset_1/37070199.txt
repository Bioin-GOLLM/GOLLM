Increasing data in allostery are requiring analysis of coupling relationships 
among different allosteric sites on a single protein. Here, based on our 
previous efforts on reversed allosteric communication theory, we have developed 
AlloReverse, a web server for multiscale analysis of multiple allosteric 
regulations. AlloReverse integrates protein dynamics and machine learning to 
discover allosteric residues, allosteric sites and regulation pathways. 
Especially, AlloReverse could reveal hierarchical relationships between 
different pathways and couplings among allosteric sites, offering a whole map of 
allostery. The web server shows a good performance in re-emerging known 
allostery. Moreover, we applied AlloReverse to explore global allostery on CDC42 
and SIRT3. AlloReverse predicted novel allosteric sites and allosteric residues 
in both systems, and the functionality of sites was validated experimentally. It 
also suggests a possible scheme for combined therapy or bivalent drugs on SIRT3. 
Taken together, AlloReverse is a novel workflow providing a complete regulation 
map and is believed to aid target identification, drug design and understanding 
of biological mechanisms. AlloReverse is freely available to all users at 
https://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/AlloReverse/ or http://www.allostery.net/AlloReverse/.
