OBJECTIVE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the most abundant 
and important neurotrophins, is known to be involved in the development, 
survival, maintenance, and plasticity of neurons in the nervous system. Some 
studies have suggested that BDNF may play a role in the pathophysiology of 
several psychiatric illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia. Similarly, 
it is likely that the alteration of BDNF may be associated with the 
neuro-modulation that contributes to the development of somatization disorder.
METHODS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an 
abnormality of plasma BDNF levels in patients with somatization disorder, and to 
analyze the nature of the alteration after pharmacotherapy using an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: The plasma BDNF levels of the patients with a somatization disorder 
were significantly lower compared with those of the control volunteers 
(83.61±89.97 pg/mL vs. 771.36±562.14 pg/mL); moreover, the plasma BDNF levels of 
those patients who received an antidepressant were significantly increased after 
the treatment (118.13±91.45 pg/mL vs. 72.92±88.21 pg/mL).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BDNF may play a role in the 
pathophysiology of somatization disorder.
