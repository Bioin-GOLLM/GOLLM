The abundance and ancient origins of transposable elements (TEs) in eukaryotic 
genomes has spawned research into the potential symbiotic relationship between 
these elements and their hosts. In this review, we introduce the diversity of 
TEs, discuss how distinct classes are uniquely regulated in development, and 
describe how they appear to have been coopted for the purposes of gene 
regulation and the orchestration of a number of processes during early embryonic 
development. Although young, active TEs play an important role in somatic 
tissues and evolution, we focus mostly on the contributions of the older, fixed 
elements in mammalian genomes. We also discuss major challenges inherent in the 
study of TEs and contemplate future experimental approaches to further 
investigate how they coordinate developmental processes.
