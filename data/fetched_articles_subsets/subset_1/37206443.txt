OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate associations of different risk factors with 
odds of diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis and retinal neurodegeneration 
represented by macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from individuals aged over 50 
years examined between June 2020 and February 2022 in the community-based 
Beichen Eye Study on ocular diseases. Baseline characteristics included 
demographic data, cardiometabolic risk factors, laboratory findings, and 
medications at enrollment. Retinal thickness in both eyes of all participants 
was measured automatically via optical coherence tomography. Risk factors 
associated with DR status were investigated using multivariable logistic 
regression. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to explore 
associations of potential risk factors with mGCIPL thickness.
RESULTS: Among the 5037 included participants with a mean (standard deviation, 
SD) age of 62.6 (6.7) years (3258 women [64.6%]), 4018 (79.8%) were control 
individuals, 835 (16.6%) were diabetic individuals with no DR, and 184 (3.7%) 
were diabetic individuals with DR. The risk factors significantly associated 
with DR status were family history of diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 4.09 [95% CI, 
2.44-6.85]), fasting plasma glucose (OR, 5.88 [95% CI, 4.66-7.43]), and statins 
(OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.03-4.43]) relative to the control individuals. Compared 
with the no DR, diabetes duration (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.13-1.22]), hypertension 
(OR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.26-2.45]), and glycated hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) (OR, 1.27 
[95% CI, 1.00-1.59]) were significantly correlated with DR status. Furthermore, 
age (adjusted β = -0.19 [95% CI, -0.25 to -0.13] μm; P < 0.001), cardiovascular 
events (adjusted β = -0.95 [95% CI, -1.78 to -0.12] μm; P = 0.03), and axial 
length (adjusted β = -0.82 [95% CI, -1.29 to -0.35] μm; P = 0.001) were 
associated with mGCIPL thinning in diabetic individuals with no DR.
CONCLUSION: Multiple risk factors were associated with higher odds of DR 
development and lower mGCIPL thickness in our study. Risk factors affecting DR 
status varied among the different study populations. Age, cardiovascular events, 
and axial length were identified as potential risk factors for consideration in 
relation to retinal neurodegeneration in diabetic patients.
