BACKGROUND: Rhodopsin (RHO) is the most well-known genetic cause of autosomal 
dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). This study aimed to investigate the 
genetic cause of a large Chinese adRP family and assess the pathogenicity of the 
detected RHO mutant.
METHODS: Routine ocular examinations were conducted on all participants. 
Next-generation sequencing with targeted capture was performed to screen 
mutations in 179 genes associated with hereditary retinal diseases and 10 
candidate genes. Variants detected by NGS were validated by Sanger sequencing 
and evaluated for pathogenicity. Fragments of mutant and wild-type RHO were 
cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector and were transfected into different cell lines 
to observe the cellular localization of the Rhodopsin-GFP fusion protein and 
evaluate the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. RT-PCR 
analysis was used to detect transfected the splicing of X box-binding protein 1 
(XBP1) mRNA, which is a critical factor affecting ER stress.
RESULTS: Genetic analysis identified a heterozygous missense variant, RHO, 
c.284 T > C (p.L95P) in this adRP family. Another RHO variant (p.P53R) that we 
reported previously was also included in further functional assessment. Both 
misfolded mutant proteins accumulated in the ER in a manner similar to that 
noted for the classic mutant P23H. Spliced XBP1 was observed in cells 
transfected with mutants, indicating an increase in ER stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the p.L95P variant is not a novel change, it was the first 
variant to be functionally evaluated and reported in Chinese RP patients. The 
results in our study provide significant evidence to classify the p.L95P 
mutation as a class II mutation.
