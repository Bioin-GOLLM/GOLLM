Several studies assessed the associations of interleukin-10 (IL-10) 
polymorphisms with asthma in different populations. However, the results were 
inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to further assess the 
associations by the method of meta-analysis. Pubmed, EMBASE, Wanfang Database, 
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Weipu Database were searched. 
Data were extracted independently by two authors. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. 
Seventeen potentially eligible articles were identified (4478 cases and 4803 
controls). Significant associations between -1082A/G and -592A/C polymorphisms 
and asthma were observed. However, there was no significant association between 
-819T/C polymorphism and asthma risk. In addition, there were significant 
associations of the IL-10 haplotypes with asthma. In summary, this meta-analysis 
suggested that IL-10 promoter polymorphisms were associated with asthma risk.
