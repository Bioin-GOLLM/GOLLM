BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) manifests itself primarily in the lungs as 
pulmonary disease (PTB) and sometimes disseminates to other organs to cause 
extra-pulmonary TB, such as lymph node TB (LNTB). This study aimed to 
investigate the role of host genetic polymorphism in immunity related genes to 
find a genetic basis for such differences.
METHODS: Sixty-three, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in twenty-three, 
TB-immunity related genes including eleven innate immunity (SLCA11, VDR, TLR2, 
TLR4, TLR8, IRGM, P2RX7, LTA4H, SP110, DCSIGN and NOS2A) and twelve cytokine 
(TNFA, IFNG, IL2, Il12, IL18, IL1B, IL10, IL6, IL4, rs1794068, IL8 and TNFB) 
genes were investigated to find genetic associations in both PTB and LNTB as 
compared to healthy community controls. The serum cytokine levels were 
correlated for association with the genotypes.
RESULTS: PTB and LNTB showed differential genetic associations. The genetic 
variants in the cytokine genes (IFNG, IL12, IL4, TNFB and IL1RA and TLR2, 4 
associated with PTB susceptibility and cytokine levels but not LNTB (p < 0.05). 
Similarly, genetic variants in LTA4H, P2RX7, DCSIGN and SP110 showed 
susceptibility to LNTB and not PTB. Pathway analysis showed abundance of 
cytokine related variants for PTB and apoptosis related variants for LNTB.
CONCLUSIONS: PTB and LNTB outcomes of TB infection have a genetic component and 
should be considered for any future functional studies or studies on 
susceptibility to pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB.
