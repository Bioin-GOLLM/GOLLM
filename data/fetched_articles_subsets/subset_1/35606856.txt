BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly of the male urogenital system. 
Genetics factors play an important role in its pathogenesis. To search for 
potential causal genes/variants for hypospadias, we performed exome sequencing 
in a pedigree with three patients across two generations and a cohort of 49 
sporadic patients with hypospadias.
RESULTS: A novel BRAF variant (NM_004333.6: c.362C > A) was found to 
co-segregate with the hypospadias phenotype in the disease pedigree. In cells 
overexpressing the BRAF mutant, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was 
significantly increased as compared with the cells overexpressing the wild-type 
BRAF or RASopathy-related BRAF mutant. This variant further led to a reduced 
transcription level of the SRY gene, which is essential for the normal 
development of the male reproductive system. In the cohort of sporadic patients, 
we identified two additional variants in p38 MAPK signaling-related genes 
(TRIM67 and DAB2IP) potentially associated with hypospadias.
CONCLUSION: Our study expands the phenotypic spectrum of variants affecting p38 
MAPK signaling toward the involvement of hypospadias.
