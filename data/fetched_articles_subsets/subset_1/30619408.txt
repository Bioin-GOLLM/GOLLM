In eukaryotic cells, the endomembrane system consists of multiple membrane-bound 
organelles, which play essential roles in the precise transportation of various 
cargo proteins. In plant cells, vacuoles are regarded as the terminus of 
catabolic pathways whereas the selection and transport of vacuolar cargoes are 
mainly mediated by two types of organelles, multivesicular bodies (MVBs) also 
termed prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and autophagosomes. MVBs are 
single-membrane bound organelles with intraluminal vesicles and mediate the 
transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and vacuoles, while 
autophagosomes are double-membrane bound organelles, which mediate cargo 
delivery to the vacuole for degradation and recycling during autophagy. Great 
progress has been achieved recently in identification and characterization of 
the conserved and plant-unique regulators involved in the MVB and autophagosome 
pathways. In this review, we present an update on the current knowledge of these 
key regulators and pay special attention to their conserved protein domains. In 
addition, we discuss the possible interplay between the MVB and autophagosome 
pathways in regulating vacuolar degradation in plants.
