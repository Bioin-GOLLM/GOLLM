BACKGROUND: Amyloid β (Aβ) has been established as a key factor for the 
pathological changes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
and cellular senescence is closely associated with aging and cognitive 
impairment. However, it remains blurred whether, in the AD brains, Aβ 
accelerates the neuronal senescence and whether this senescence, in turn, 
impairs the cognitive function. This study aimed to explore the expression of 
senescence-associated genes in the hippocampal tissue from young to aged 5XFAD 
mice and their age-matched wild type (WT) mice to determine whether senescent 
neurons are present in the transgenic AD mouse model.
METHODS: The 5XFAD mice and age-matched wild type mice, both raised from 1 to 18 
months, were enrolled in the study. The senescence-associated genes in the 
hippocampus were analyzed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
screened by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cognitive 
performance of the mice was evaluated by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. 
Oligomeric Aβ (oAβ) (1-42) was applied to culture primary neurons to simulate 
the in vivo manifestation. Aging-related proteins were detected by Western 
blotting analysis and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: In 5XFAD mice, of all the DEGs, the senescence-associated marker p16 
was most significantly increased, even at the early age. It was mainly localized 
in neurons, with a marginal expression in astrocytes (labeled as glutamine 
synthetase), nil expression in activated microglia (labeled as Iba1), and 
negatively correlated with the spatial cognitive impairments of 5XFAD mice. oAβ 
(1-42) induced the production of senescence-related protein p16, but not p53 in 
vitro, which was in line with the in vivo manifestation.
CONCLUSIONS: oAβ-accelerated neuronal senescence may be associated with the 
cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice. Senescence-associated marker p16 can serve 
as an indicator to estimate the cognitive prognosis for AD population.
