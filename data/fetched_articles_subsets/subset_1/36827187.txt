Interleukin-18 (IL-18) promotes natural killer (NK) and T cell production of 
interferon (IFN)-γ, a key factor in resistance to Toxoplasma gondii, but 
previous work has shown a limited role for endogenous IL-18 in control of this 
parasite. Although infection with T. gondii results in release of IL-18, the 
production of IFN-γ induces high levels of the IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). 
Antagonism of IL-18BP with a "decoy-to-the-decoy" (D2D) IL-18 construct that 
does not signal but rather binds IL-18BP results in enhanced innate lymphoid 
cell (ILC) and T cell responses and improved parasite control. In addition, the 
use of IL-18 resistant to IL-18BP ("decoy-resistant" IL-18 [DR-18]) is more 
effective than exogenous IL-18 at promoting innate resistance to infection. 
DR-18 enhances CD4+ T cell production of IFN-γ but results in CD4+ 
T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, endogenous IL-18BP restrains aberrant immune 
pathology, and this study highlights strategies that can be used to tune this 
regulatory pathway for optimal anti-pathogen responses.
