PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic 
value of IL-6 and sTREM-1 in the course of SIRS and sepsis in children with 
reference to routinely used CRP and PCT.
METHODS: A prospective study included 180 patients at the ages from 2 months to 
18 years hospitalized due to fever from November 2015 to January 2017. 
Forty-nine children without fever hospitalized due to noninfectious causes 
formed the control group. IL-6 and sTREM-1 serum concentrations were assessed 
with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.
RESULTS: The mean serum concentrations of all the analyzed biomarkers were 
statistically significantly higher in the study group compared to the control 
group. Mean IL-6, sTREM-1, and PCT serum concentrations were statistically 
significantly higher in the group of patients with SIRS/sepsis compared to the 
group of feverish patients without diagnosed SIRS (N-SIRS). Based on the ROC 
curve analysis, it was shown that of all the biomarkers tested, only two-IL-6 
and procalcitonin-had potential usefulness in the diagnosis of SIRS/sepsis in 
children with fever.
CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of IL-6 and PCT are important risk factors for the 
development of SIRS/sepsis in children with fever. It seems that elevated IL-6 
baseline serum level may predict a more severe course of febrile illness in 
children, because based on the ROC curve analysis, it was found that IL-6 is a 
statistically significant prognostic marker of prolonged fever ≥ 3 days and 
prolonged hospitalization > 10 days. The assessment of the usefulness of sTREM-1 
in the diagnosis of SIRS/sepsis in feverish children requires further research.
