GPRC6A is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by l-amino acids, which, based 
on analyses of knock-out mice, has been suggested to have physiological 
functions in metabolism and testicular function. The human ortholog is, however, 
mostly retained intracellularly in contrast to the cell surface-expressed murine 
and goldfish orthologs. The latter orthologs are Gq-coupled and lead to 
intracellular accumulation of inositol phosphates and calcium release. In the 
present study we cloned the bonobo chimpanzee GPRC6A receptor, which is 99% 
identical to the human receptor, and show that it is cell surface-expressed and 
functional. By analyses of chimeric human/mouse and human/bonobo receptors, 
bonobo receptor mutants, and the single nucleotide polymorphism database at 
NCBI, we identify an insertion/deletion variation in the third intracellular 
loop responsible for the intracellular retention and lack of function of the 
human ortholog. Genetic analyses of the 1000 genome database and the Inter99 
cohort of 6,000 Danes establish the distribution of genotypes among ethnic 
groups, showing that the cell surface-expressed and functional variant is much 
more prevalent in the African population than in European and Asian populations 
and that this variant is partly linked with a stop codon early in the receptor 
sequence (rs6907580, amino acid position 57). In conclusion, our data solve a 
more than decade-old question of why the cloned human GPRC6A receptor is not 
cell surface-expressed and functional and provide a genetic framework to study 
human phenotypic traits in large genome sequencing projects linked with 
physiological measurement and biomarkers.
