Increasing evidence has confirmed the vital role of Notch signaling in the 
tumorigenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The underlying 
function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) related to Notch signaling in ccRCC 
remains unclear. In present study, the prognostic value and therapeutic strategy 
of Notch signaling-related lncRNA are comprehensively explored in ccRCC. In 
total, we acquired 1422 NSRlncRNAs, of which 41 lncRNAs were identified the key 
NSRlncRNAs associated with the occurrence of ccRCC. The prognostic signature 
containing five NSRlncRNAs (AC092611.2, NNT-AS1, AGAP2-AS1, AC147651.3, and 
AC007406.3) was established and validated, and the ccRCC patients were clustered 
into the high- and low-risk groups. The overall survival of patients in the 
low-risk group were much more favorable than those in the high-risk group. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the risk score was an 
independent prognostic biomarker. Based on the risk score and clinical 
variables, a nomogram for predicting prognosis of ccRCC patients was 
constructed, and the calibration curves and DCA curves showed the superior 
predictive ability of nomogram. The risk score was correlated with immune cell 
infiltration, targeted therapy or chemotherapy sensitivity, and multiple 
oncogenic pathways. Additionally, consensus clustering analysis stratified the 
ccRCC patients into four clusters with obvious different outcomes, immune 
microenvironments, and expression of immune checkpoints. The constructed 
NSRlncRNA-based signature might serve as a potential biomarker for predicting 
prognosis and response to immunotherapy or targeted therapy in patients with 
ccRCC.
