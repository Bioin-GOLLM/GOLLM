BACKGROUND: Dalcetrapib effects on cardiovascular outcomes are determined by 
adenylate cyclase 9 gene polymorphisms. Our aim was to determine whether these 
clinical end point results are also associated with changes in reverse 
cholesterol transport and inflammation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants of the dal-OUTCOMES and dal-PLAQUE-2 trials 
were randomly assigned to receive dalcetrapib or placebo in addition to standard 
care. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured at baseline and at end of 
study in 5243 patients from dal-OUTCOMES also genotyped for the rs1967309 
polymorphism in adenylate cyclase 9. Cholesterol efflux capacity of high-density 
lipoproteins from J774 macrophages after cAMP stimulation was determined at 
baseline and 12 months in 171 genotyped patients from dal-PLAQUE-2. Treatment 
with dalcetrapib resulted in placebo-adjusted geometric mean percent increases 
in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to end of trial of 18.1% 
(P=0.0009) and 18.7% (P=0.00001) in participants with the GG and AG genotypes, 
respectively, but the change was -1.0% (P=0.89) in those with the protective AA 
genotype. There was an interaction between the treatment arm and the genotype 
groups (P=0.02). Although the mean change in cholesterol efflux was similar 
among study arms in patients with GG genotype (mean: 7.8% and 7.4%), increases 
were 22.3% and 3.5% with dalcetrapib and placebo for those with AA genotype 
(P=0.005). There was a significant genetic effect for change in efflux for 
dalcetrapib (P=0.02), but not with placebo.
CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-dependent effects on C-reactive protein and cholesterol 
efflux are supportive of dalcetrapib benefits on atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
outcomes in patients with the AA genotype at polymorphism rs1967309.
