Baicalin (BA) is a major flavone from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and has 
showed significant curative effects in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. In 
the present study, we investigated the effects of BA on antineuroinflammation 
and related signaling cascade in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced BV-2 
microglial model. The results showed that BA significantly attenuated 
inflammatory mediators (NO, iNOS, IL-1β, COX-2, and PGE2) and suppressed the 
expression of miR-155. More crucially, BA could regulate the expression of 
related proteins in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation protein 
88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway and suppress the phosphorylation of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. In addition, molecular docking 
analysis indicated that BA binds to the amino acids Lie 63 and Tyr 65 of TLR4 by 
π-σ and π-π T-shaped interaction. Thus, BA suppressed the LPS-stimulated 
neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia by blocking the TLR4-mediated signal 
transduction through TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and MAPK pathways and inhibiting the 
miR-155 expression. Our findings demonstrated that BA could be a valuable 
therapeutic for the treatment of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative 
diseases.
