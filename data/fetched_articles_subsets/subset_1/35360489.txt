Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated genetic targeting of microglia remains a 
challenge. Overcoming this hurdle is essential for gene editing in the central 
nervous system (CNS). Here, we characterized the minimal/native promoter of the 
HEXB gene, which is known to be specifically and stably expressed in the 
microglia during homeostatic and pathological conditions. Dual reporter and 
serial deletion assays identified the critical role of the natural 5' 
untranslated region (-97 bp related to the first ATG) in driving transcriptional 
activity of the mouse Hexb gene. The native promoter region of mouse, human, and 
monkey HEXB are located at -135, -134, and -170 bp to the first ATG, 
respectively. These promoters were highly active and specific in microglia with 
strong cross-species transcriptional activities, but did not exhibit activity in 
primary astrocytes. In addition, we identified a 135 bp promoter of CD68 gene 
that was highly active in microglia but not in astrocytes. Considering that HEXB 
is specifically expressed in microglia, these data suggest that the newly 
characterized microglia-specific HEXB minimal/native promoter can be an ideal 
candidate for microglia-targeting AAV gene therapy in the CNS.
