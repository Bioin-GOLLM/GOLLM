In the last 20 years, improvements in metastatic colorectal cancer treatment 
lead to a radical raise of outcomes with median survival reaching now more than 
30 months. Despite that, the identification of predictive and/or prognostic 
biomarker still represents a challenging issue, and until today, although 
clinician and researchers might face with a deeper knowledge of biological 
mechanisms related to colorectal cancer, many pieces of evidence underline the 
heterogeneity and the dynamism of such disease. In the present review, we 
describe the road leading to the discovery of RAS mutations, BRAF V600E 
mutation, and microsatellite instability role in colorectal cancer; second, we 
discuss some of the possible major pitfalls of biomarker research, and lastly, 
we give new suggestions for future research in this field.
