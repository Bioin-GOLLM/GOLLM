BACKGROUND: Modern sequencing technologies should make the assembly of the 
relatively small mitochondrial genomes an easy undertaking. However, few tools 
exist that address mitochondrial assembly directly.
RESULTS: As part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) we develop mitoVGP, a 
fully automated pipeline for similarity-based identification of mitochondrial 
reads and de novo assembly of mitochondrial genomes that incorporates both long 
(> 10 kbp, PacBio or Nanopore) and short (100-300 bp, Illumina) reads. Our 
pipeline leads to successful complete mitogenome assemblies of 100 vertebrate 
species of the VGP. We observe that tissue type and library size selection have 
considerable impact on mitogenome sequencing and assembly. Comparing our 
assemblies to purportedly complete reference mitogenomes based on short-read 
sequencing, we identify errors, missing sequences, and incomplete genes in those 
references, particularly in repetitive regions. Our assemblies also identify 
novel gene region duplications. The presence of repeats and duplications in over 
half of the species herein assembled indicates that their occurrence is a 
principle of mitochondrial structure rather than an exception, shedding new 
light on mitochondrial genome evolution and organization.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that even in the "simple" case of vertebrate 
mitogenomes the completeness of many currently available reference sequences can 
be further improved, and caution should be exercised before claiming the 
complete assembly of a mitogenome, particularly from short reads alone.
