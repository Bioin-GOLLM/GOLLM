Ameloblastomas are a group of benign, locally aggressive, recurrent tumors 
characterized by their slow and infiltrative growth. E-Cadherin and syndecan-1 
are cell adhesion molecules related to the behavior of various tumors, including 
ameloblastomas. Ninety-nine ameloblastoma samples were studied; the expression 
of E-cadherin and syndecan-1 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. E-Cadherin 
and epithelial syndecan-1 were more highly expressed in intraluminal/luminal 
unicystic ameloblastoma than in mural unicystic ameloblastoma and 
solid/multicystic ameloblastoma, whereas the stromal expression of syndecan-1 
was higher in mural unicystic ameloblastoma and solid/multicystic ameloblastoma. 
Synchronicity was observed between E-cadherin and epithelial syndecan-1; the 
expression was correlated with intensity in all cases. There was a strong 
association between expression and tumor size and recurrence. The evaluation of 
the expression of E-cadherin and syndecan-1 are important for determining the 
potential aggressiveness of ameloblastoma variants. Future studies are required 
to understand how the expression of these markers is related to tumor 
aggressiveness.
