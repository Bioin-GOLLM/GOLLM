BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between interaction of 
retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) (rs8042149) genotype x trauma 
exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
METHODS: A total of 1196 Chinese adults who suffered from a deadly 2008 Wenchuan 
earthquake participated in this study. PTSD symptoms were measured with the PTSD 
Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). A custom-by-design 2×48-Plex SNPscan™Kit were used 
to genotype the RORA rs8042149 SNP.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the interaction of rs8042149 genotype x trauma 
exposure was associated with total PTSD symptoms in males. Moreover, the 
rs8042149 genotype x trauma exposure interaction was only associated with 
severity of the negative affect, anhedonia and dysphoric arousal symptoms in 
males.
LIMITATIONS: A moderate sample exposed to a specific event was assessed with a 
self-reported PTSD measure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the functional 
role of RORA in PTSD, and adds to the knowledge for understanding the genetic 
underpinnings of PTSD. Moreover, this study carries implications for 
understanding the comorbidity of PTSD and the sex-specific expression of PTSD's 
symptoms.
