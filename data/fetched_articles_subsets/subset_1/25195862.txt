Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic virus and the 
culprit behind the human disease Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an AIDS-defining 
malignancy. KSHV encodes a viral G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) critical for 
the initiation and progression of KS. In this study, we identified that YAP/TAZ, 
two homologous oncoproteins inhibited by the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, are 
activated in KSHV-infected cells in vitro, KS-like mouse tumors and clinical 
human KS specimens. The KSHV-encoded vGPCR acts through Gq/11 and G12/13 to 
inhibit the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2, promoting the activation of YAP/TAZ. 
Furthermore, depletion of YAP/TAZ blocks vGPCR-induced cell proliferation and 
tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse model. The vGPCR-transformed cells are 
sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of YAP. Our study establishes a pivotal 
role of the Hippo pathway in mediating the oncogenic activity of KSHV and 
development of KS, and also suggests a potential of using YAP inhibitors for KS 
intervention.
