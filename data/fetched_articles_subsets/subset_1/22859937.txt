Coding region alterations of ZIC2 are the second most common type of mutation in 
holoprosencephaly (HPE). Here we use several complementary bioinformatic 
approaches to identify ultraconserved cis-regulatory sequences potentially 
driving the expression of human ZIC2. We demonstrate that an 804 bp element in 
the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) is highly conserved across the evolutionary 
history of vertebrates from fish to humans. Furthermore, we show that while 
genetic variation of this element is unexpectedly common among holoprosencephaly 
subjects (6/528 or >1%), it is not present in control individuals. Two of six 
proband-unique variants are de novo, supporting their pathogenic involvement in 
HPE outcomes. These findings support a general recommendation that the 
identification and analysis of key ultraconserved elements should be 
incorporated into the genetic risk assessment of holoprosencephaly cases.
