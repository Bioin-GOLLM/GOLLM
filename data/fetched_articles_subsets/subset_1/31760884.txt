Hypertension and obesity in the young population are major risk factors for 
renal and cardiovascular events, which could arise in adulthood. A 
candidate-gene approach was applied in a cohort observational study, in which we 
collected data from 2638 high school adolescent students. Participants underwent 
anthropometric and blood pressure (BP) measurements, as well as saliva and urine 
sample collection for genomic DNA extraction and renal function evaluation, 
respectively. We tested whether candidate genes previously implicated in 
salt-sensitive hypertension in adults impact BP also among adolescents. Since 
inflammatory mechanisms may be involved in pathophysiology of hypertension and 
in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis through reactive oxygen species, 
the baseline urinary excretion of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in a 
subgroup of adolescents stratified according to ADD1(alpha adducin) rs4961 
genotypes was assessed. Regression analysis of BP values with genetic 
polymorphisms, highlighted an association with a missense variant of LSS 
(lanosterol synthase, rs2254524), a gene coding for an enzyme involved in 
endogenous ouabain synthesis. Higher diastolic and systolic BP were associated 
with LSS A allele (P=0.011 and P=0.023, respectively). BP resulted associated 
with 5 more SNPs. The KL (klotho) rs9536314 missense variant was associated with 
24 hour urinary Na+ excretion (P=0.0083). Urinary protein tests showed a greater 
excretion of IL1β (interleukin 1β) and interleukin 10 (P<0.0001) in carriers of 
the ADD1 rs4961 T allele. In conclusion, 3 missense gene variants already 
implicated in adult hypertension impact BP or Na+ excretion among adolescents, 
and, together with activated pro-inflammatory pathways, might predispose to 
early cardiovascular damage.
