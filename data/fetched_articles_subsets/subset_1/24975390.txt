Congenital unilateral overgrowth of the upper extremity affecting only the 
muscle tissue is rare. We describe on the clinical, histopathological, and 
neuroimaging findings in a 6-year-old girl with a congenital, non-progressive 
muscle enlargement of the entire left upper limb with an ipsilateral hand 
deformity. No cutaneous stigmata or additional features were detected. Sanger 
sequencing for the AKT1, PIK3CA, and PTEN genes identified an activating 
c.3140A>G, p.H1047R mutation in the PIK3CA gene from the affected muscle DNA. We 
demonstrate that isolated congenital muscular upper limb overgrowth with 
aberrant hand muscles is another condition related genetically to the 
PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum.
