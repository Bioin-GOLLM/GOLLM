A multilayered computational workflow was designed to identify a druggable 
binding site on the surface of the E200K pathogenic mutant of the human prion 
protein, and to investigate the effect of the binding of small molecules in the 
inhibition of the early aggregation of this protein. At this purpose, we 
developed an efficient computational tool to scan the molecular interaction 
properties of a whole MD trajectory, thus leading to the characterization of 
plausible binding regions on the surface of PrP-E200K. These structural data 
were then employed to drive structure-based virtual screening and fragment-based 
approaches to the seeking of small molecular binders of the PrP-E200K. Six 
promising compounds were identified, and their binding stabilities were assessed 
by MD simulations. Therefore, analyses of the molecular electrostatic potential 
similarity between the bound complexes and unbound protein evidenced their 
potential activity as charged-based inhibitors of the PrP-E200K early 
aggregation.
