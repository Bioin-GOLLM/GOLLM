Listeriolysin O (LLO) is necessary for bacterial escape from the phagosome into 
the cytoplasm, which suggests that targeting LLO may be an alternative strategy 
to combat Listeria monocytogenes-mediated infection. Here, luteolin, a natural 
compound without anti-bacterial activity, as indentified as effective inhibitor 
of LLO by translationally inhibiting the production of LLO. Additionally, 
luteolin-treated L. monocytogenes displayed reductions in cytoplasmic growth, 
cytotoxicity and phagosome escape within macrophages. Molecular modeling and 
mutational analysis revealed a direct interaction between luteolin and the 5' 
coding region (A818, U819, G820, and U830 located in nt 814-849) of the mRNA of 
hly, the gene encoding LLO, which interfered with its translation. Together, our 
data demonstrate that luteolin may be used as a novel therapeutic and lead 
compound for treating L. monocytogenes infection.
