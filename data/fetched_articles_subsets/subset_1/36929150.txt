SCOPE: To avoid ingestion of potentially harmful substances, humans are equipped 
with about 25 bitter taste receptor genes (TAS2R) expressed in oral taste cells. 
Humans exhibit considerable variance in their bitter tasting abilities, which 
are associated with genetic polymorphisms in bitter taste receptor genes. One of 
these variant receptor genes, TAS2R2, is initially believed to represent a 
pseudogene. However, TAS2R2 exists in a putative functional variant within some 
populations and can therefore be considered as an additional functional bitter 
taste receptor.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To learn more about the function of the experimentally 
neglected TAS2R2, a functional screening with 122 bitter compounds is performed. 
The study observes responses with eight of the 122 bitter substances and 
identifies the substance phenylbutazone as a unique activator of TAS2R2 among 
the family of TAS2Rs, thus filling one more gap in the array of cognate bitter 
substances.
CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive characterization of the receptive range of TAS2R2 
allows the classification into the group of TAS2Rs with a medium number of 
bitter agonists. The variability of bitter taste and its potential influences on 
food choice in some human populations may be even higher than assumed.
