Although the majority (65%) of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) carry 
a deletion in the dystrophin gene, finding mutations in the remaining families 
is vital for counselling. We have provided a comprehensive mutation service as a 
national referral centre for France for over 10 years and we report here our 
experience. Mutation screening is on mRNA from a muscle biopsy. We have detected 
79 mutations in 89 samples referred with a diagnosis of DMD, which is the most 
comprehensive survey to date of the full range of nondeletion mutations. 
Although some mutations were nonsense mutations, some frameshift mutations and 
some splicing mutations, all of them led to the generation of premature stop 
codons or a shortened product which could be detected using the Protein 
Truncation Test. We recommend a protocol which is robust and sensitive applied 
to the entire coding region reverse-transcribed from dystrophin transcripts from 
muscle biopsy.
