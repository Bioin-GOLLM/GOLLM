A series of [5-substituted-4-phenyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl] benzamide and furamide 
analogues were investigated in radioligand binding studies at adenosine receptor 
subtypes with an aim to obtain potent and selective adenosine receptor ligands. 
Benzamide and furamide linked to thiazole was found to be crucial for high 
adenosine receptor affinity. The most potent compound indentified in this study 
was 5d with low nanomolar affinity for all four adenosine receptor subtypes. 
Compounds 5a and 5g showed moderate selectivity for A2A adenosine receptors. 
Molecular docking versus all four human adenosine receptors combined with 
membrane molecular dynamics studies were performed to rationalise the peculiar 
selectivity profile of 5d antagonist.
