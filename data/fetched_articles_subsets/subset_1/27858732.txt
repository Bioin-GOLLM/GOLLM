BACKGROUND: GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessively inherited muscle 
disease resulting from mutations in the gene encoding GNE 
(UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase), a key enzyme 
in sialic acid biosynthesis. 154 different pathogenic variants have been 
previously associated with GNE myopathy.
OBJECTIVE: Describe novel pathogenic variants associated with GNE myopathy in a 
large French cohort.
METHODS: We analyzed mutational data from 32 GNE myopathy index patients. Novel, 
as well as previously published pathogenic variants, were examined for possible 
deleterious effects on splicing.
RESULTS: We describe 13 novel pathogenic variants in GNE, identified in the 
first large French cohort reported to date. We also find that 6 published 
pathogenic variants might have a previously unrecognized deleterious effect on 
splicing.
CONCLUSIONS: Novel pathogenic GNE variants described here raise the total number 
of different pathogenic variants reported to 167, complementing the recently 
published GNE mutation update. Our novel findings on possible splice-disrupting 
effects by several variants suggest that the pathogenicity mechanism of these 
variants could be reinterpreted, expanding our knowledge about the GNE 
mutational spectrum.
