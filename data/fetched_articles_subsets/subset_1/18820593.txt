OBJECTIVE: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)*3A is degraded much more 
rapidly than is the 'wild-type' enzyme through a ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent 
process. It also forms aggresomes, suggesting a possible dynamic balance between 
degradation and aggregation. We set out to identify genes encoding proteins 
participating in these processes.
METHODS: Green fluorescent protein tagged TPMT*3A was expressed in a 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene deletion library, and flow cytometry was used to 
screen for cells with high fluorescence intensity, indicating the loss of a gene 
essential for TPMT*3A degradation.
RESULTS: Twenty-four yeast genes were identified in functional categories that 
included ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, vesicle trafficking, and 
vacuolar degradation. The presence of genes encoding proteins involved in 
vesicular transport and vacuolar degradation suggested a possible role in 
TPMT*3A degradation for autophagy--a process not previously identified as a 
pharmacogenomic mechanism. In support of that hypothesis, TPMT*3A aggregates 
increased dramatically in mutants for vacuolar protease and autophagy-related 
genes. Furthermore, TPMT*3A expression in human cells induced autophagy, and 
small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7, an autophagy-related human 
protein, enhanced TPMT*3A aggregation but not that of TPMT*3C or wild-type TPMT, 
indicating that autophagy contributes to TPMT*3A degradation in mammalian cells. 
We also demonstrated that UBE2G2, the human homologue of the E2 
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme identified during the yeast genetic screen, was 
involved in TPMT*3A degradation in human cells.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that autophagy should be considered among 
mechanisms responsible for the effects of pharmacogenetically significant 
polymorphisms that alter encoded amino acids.
