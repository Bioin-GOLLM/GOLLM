The T790M mutation in EGFR accounts for approximately half of all lung cancer 
cases with acquired resistance to the current clinical EGFR tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors. In tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant lung tumors, rociletinib and 
AZD9291 are highly active when T790M is present and modestly active when T790M 
is absent.
