BACKGROUND: FBXW7 functions as a ubiquitin ligase tagging multiple dominant 
oncogenic proteins and commonly mutates in colorectal cancer. Data suggest 
missense mutations lead to greater loss of FBXW7 function than other gene 
aberrations do. However, the clinicopathologic factors and outcomes associated 
with FBXW7 missense mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) have not 
been described.
METHODS: Data were obtained from mCRC patients whose tumors were evaluated by 
next-generation sequencing for hotspot mutations at The University of Texas MD 
Anderson Cancer Center. Alterations in FBXW7 were identified, and their 
associations with clinicopathologic features and overall survival (OS) were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 855 mCRC patients, 571 had data on FBXW7 status; 43 (7.5%) had FBXW7 
mutations, including 37 with missense mutations. R465C mutations in exon 9 were 
the most common missense mutations (18.6%). PIK3CA mutations were associated 
with FBXW7 missense mutations (p=0.012). On univariate analysis, patients with 
FBXW7 missense mutations had significantly worse OS (median 28.7 mo) than those 
with wild-type FBXW7 (median 46.6 mo; p=0.003). On multivariate analysis 
including other known prognostic factors such as BRAF mutations, FBXW7 missense 
mutations were the strongest negative prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio 
2.0; p=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest clinical dataset of mCRC to date, FBXW7 missense 
mutations showed a strong negative prognostic association.
