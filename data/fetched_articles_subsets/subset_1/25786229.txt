Calotropis procera R. Br., a traditional medicinal plant in India, is a 
promising source of commercial proteases, because the cysteine proteases from 
the plant exhibit high thermo-stability, broad pH optima, and plasma-clotting 
activity. Though several proteases such as Procerain, Procerain B, CpCp-1, 
CpCp-2, and CpCp-3 have been isolated and characterized, the information of 
their transcripts is limited to cDNAs encoding their mature peptides. Due to 
this limitation, in this study, to determine the cDNA sequences encoding full 
open reading frame of these cysteine proteases, transcripts were sequenced with 
an Illumina Hiseq2000 sequencer. A total of 171,253,393 clean reads were 
assembled into 106,093 contigs with an average length of 1,614 bp and an N50 of 
2,703 bp, and 70,797 contigs with an average length of 1,565 bp and N50 of 2,082 
bp using Trinity and Velvet-Oases software, respectively. Among these contigs, 
we found 20 unigenes related to papain-like cysteine proteases by BLASTX 
analysis against a non-redundant NCBI protein database. Our expression analysis 
revealed that the cysteine protease contains an N-terminal pro-peptide domain 
(inhibitor region), which is necessary for correct folding and proteolytic 
activity. It was evident that expression yields using an inducible T7 expression 
system in Escherichia coli were considerably higher with the pro-peptide domain 
than without the domain, which could contribute to molecular cloning of the 
Calotropis procera protease as an active form with correct folding.
