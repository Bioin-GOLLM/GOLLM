Hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) are rare, basilar developmental lesions with 
widespread comorbidities often associated with refractory epilepsy and 
encephalopathy. Imaging advances allow for early, even prenatal, detection. 
Genetic studies suggest mutations in GLI3 and other patterning genes are 
involved in HH pathogenesis. About 50%-80% of children with HH have severe rage 
and aggression and a majority of patients exhibit externalizing disorders. 
Behavioral disruption and intellectual disability may predate epilepsy. 
Neuropsychological, sleep, and endocrine disorders are typical. The purpose of 
this article is to provide a summary of the current understanding of HH and to 
highlight opportunities for future research.
