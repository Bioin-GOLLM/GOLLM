Skeletal muscle rapidly remodels in response to various stresses, and the 
resulting changes in muscle mass profoundly influence our health and quality of 
life. We identified a diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ)-mediated pathway that 
regulated muscle mass during remodeling. During mechanical overload, DGKζ 
abundance was increased and required for effective hypertrophy. DGKζ not only 
augmented anabolic responses but also suppressed ubiquitin-proteasome system 
(UPS)-dependent proteolysis. We found that DGKζ inhibited the transcription 
factor FoxO that promotes the induction of the UPS. This function was mediated 
through a mechanism that was independent of kinase activity but dependent on the 
nuclear localization of DGKζ. During denervation, DGKζ abundance was also 
increased and was required for mitigating the activation of FoxO-UPS and the 
induction of atrophy. Conversely, overexpression of DGKζ prevented 
fasting-induced atrophy. Therefore, DGKζ is an inhibitor of the FoxO-UPS 
pathway, and interventions that increase its abundance could prevent muscle 
wasting.
