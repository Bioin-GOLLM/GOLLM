BACKGROUND: To explore the expression level of miR-664-3p in osteosarcoma and 
its effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells.
METHODS: Specimens of osteosarcoma tissues were collected from 41 cases 
undergoing surgical treatment in the Orthopedics Department of Wuhan Puai 
Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 2015 to February 2018. Another 40 cases of 
normal bone tissue were collected. The expression of miR-664-3p were detected 
using quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction. miR-664-3p mimics, 
miR-664-3p inhibitor and miR-664-3p negative control (NC) were used to transfect 
U2-OS, which were named as mimics group, inhibitor group and NC group, 
respectively. MTT assay was adopted to detect the effects of microRNA-664-3p on 
the proliferation of U2-OS after 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours of transfection. 
Flow cytometry was applied to measure the apoptosis rate of U2-OS after 
miR-664-3p transfection. Finally, Western Blot was employed to detect the 
expression of proteolipid protein 2 (PLP2).
RESULTS: The total apoptosis rate of cells in the inhibitor group was obviously 
higher than those in the mimics group and the NC group (P<0.001). The relative 
expression level of PLP2 in the inhibitor group was significantly lower than 
those in the mimics group and the NC group (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: MiR-664-3p may be involved in the occurrence and development of 
osteosarcoma, and can regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of U2-OS cells, 
and the expression of PLP2. Besides, miR-664-3p may become a novel molecular 
biological indicator for the diagnosis, targeted treatment and prognosis 
assessment of osteosarcoma.
