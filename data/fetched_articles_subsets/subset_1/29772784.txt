Capsaicin, the major active constituent of chilli, is an agonist on transient 
receptor potential vanilloid channel 1 (TRPV1). TRPV1 is present on many 
metabolically active tissues, making it a potentially relevant target for 
metabolic interventions. Insulin resistance and obesity, being the major 
components of metabolic syndrome, increase the risk for the development of 
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 
In vitro and pre-clinical studies have established the effectiveness of low-dose 
dietary capsaicin in attenuating metabolic disorders. These responses of 
capsaicin are mediated through activation of TRPV1, which can then modulate 
processes such as browning of adipocytes, and activation of metabolic modulators 
including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor α (PPARα), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1). Modulation of these pathways by capsaicin can increase fat oxidation, 
improve insulin sensitivity, decrease body fat, and improve heart and liver 
function. Identifying suitable ways of administering capsaicin at an effective 
dose would warrant its clinical use through the activation of TRPV1. This review 
highlights the mechanistic options to improve metabolic syndrome with capsaicin.
