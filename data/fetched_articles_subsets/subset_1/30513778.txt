Two camptothecin derivatives, 10-cyclohexyl-7-methyl-20(S)-camptothecin and 
7-methyl-10-morpholino-20(S)-camptothecin, were synthesized and their 
differences in solubility were investigated using four chosen solvent systems. 
Based on our results, 10-cyclohexyl-7-methyl-20(S)-camptothecin exhibited higher 
solubilities than 7-methyl-10-morpholino-20(S)-camptothecin in polar aprotic 
solvents. However, these two camptothecin derivatives did not exhibit apparent 
differences in solubility between 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/95% normal saline 
co-solvent system and 5% dimethylacetamide (DMAC)/95% normal saline co-solvent 
system. To rationalize their differences in solubility, we also tried to perform 
a DFT-B3LYP study to investigate their interaction with one water molecule.
