WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: An imbalance in the genetically controlled pro- and 
anti-inflammatory cytokine production could potentially promote ongoing 
low-grade inflammation following an episode of acute gastroenteritis and, 
subsequently, could result in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; post-infectious 
IBS, PI-IBS). Since there is very little known on the impact of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) on IBS, we conducted the 
present study with aims of determining the correlation between TNF-α gene 
polymorphisms (-308 G > A and -238 G > A) and susceptibility to IBS and drug 
efficacy in children.
METHODS: Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients and healthy subjects were recruited 
for DNA extraction. The genotypes were tested using polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. In addition to conventional 
symptomatic treatments, Live Combined Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and 
Enterococcus Powder and Montmorillonite Powder were administered to all the 
patients participating in the study for consecutive 4 weeks. The efficacy was 
evaluated 2 weeks after the withdrawal of the drugs. The association between 
gene polymorphism and drug efficacy was analysed by means of binary logistic 
regression analysis.
RESULTS: Patients in the IBS group were susceptible to IBS with GA genotype and 
A allele of -308 G > A so were those with AA genotype and A allele of -238 
G > A. The symptoms were also alleviated following treatment. The cure rate of 
patients with GA genotype of -308 G > A and AA genotype of -238 G > A was low. 
These findings suggested that the haplotype AA could potentially be associated 
with the cure rate of IBS patients. GA genotype of -308 G > A, AA genotype of 
-238 G > A, enterobacteria and 5-hydroxytryptamine in serum may act adversely, 
whereas bifidobacterial may be beneficial to the efficacy of IBS treatment.
WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The above findings evidently suggest that the 
frequency of TNF-α gene -308 G > A carrying GA genotype and A allele and -238 
G > A carrying AA genotype and A allele is higher in children with IBS. 
Additionally, GA genotype of -308 G > A and AA genotype of -238 G > A may act 
adversely to the efficacy of IBS treatment, which may be a reference index for 
predicting the curative effect of IBS.
