BACKGROUND: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a hereditary disorder of the 
connective tissue affecting the skin, retina, and cardiovascular system and 
characterized by progressive calcification of abnormal and fragmented elastic 
fibers in the extracellular matrix. The aim of the present study was to 
investigate the association of fetuin-A, a major systemic inhibitor of 
calcification, with PXE.
METHODS: Fetuin-A was measured by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay in 
sera from 110 German patients with PXE, 53 unaffected first-degree family 
members, and 80 healthy blood donors. We determined the distribution of the 
fetuin-A polymorphisms c.742C>T (p.T248M) and c.766C>G (p.T256S) in these same 3 
groups. The occurrences of the frequent ABCC6 gene mutations c.3421C>T 
(p.R1141X) and c.EX23_EX29del were also assessed.
RESULTS: Serum fetuin-A concentrations in male and female PXE patients were 
lower than in unaffected first-degree relatives and controls [mean (SD) 
concentrations, 0.55 (0.11) g/L in patients; 0.70 (0.23) g/L in relatives; and 
0.80 (0.23) g/L in controls (P <0.0001)]. Serum fetuin-A was higher in female 
PXE patients with cardiovascular involvement than in the corresponding male 
group (P <0.05). The fetuin-A polymorphism frequencies did not differ among PXE 
patients, family members, and blood donors.
CONCLUSION: A deficiency of multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 leads to 
alteration of circulating substrates, e.g., inhibitors of calcification as 
fetuin-A, leading to progressive mineralization of elastic fibers in PXE.
