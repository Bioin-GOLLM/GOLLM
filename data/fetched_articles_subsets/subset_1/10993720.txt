Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder 
mainly caused by defects in the steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. For 
reliable and accurate mutation detection in the CYP21 gene it is important to 
separate the CYP21 gene from the highly homologous CYP21P pseudogene. For this, 
several different strategies have been developed. In the analysis of the common 
eight nucleotide deletion at codon 110-112, a strategy using the TaqI 
restriction enzyme was first applied. In one family, the results showed 
discordance between parents and offspring. The use of microsatellite markers 
flanking the genuine CYP21 gene did not lead to a correct assignment. The 
problem was finally resolved by using differential PCR amplification for 
generating a CYP21-specific template. It was concluded that incomplete TaqI 
digestion, although not visible on an agarose gel, allowed the amplification of 
the CYP21P pseudogene, thus leading to a false positive diagnosis. Therefore, we 
recommend the use of direct gene-specific primers for the essential step in the 
molecular diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 
21-hydroxylase deficiency.
