Pigmentary manifestations can represent an early clinical sign in children 
affected by Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Legius syndrome, and other 
neurocutaneous disorders. The differential molecular diagnosis of these 
pathologies is a challenge that can now be met by combining next generation 
sequencing of target genes with concurrent second-level tests, such as multiplex 
ligation-dependent probe amplification and RNA analysis. We clinically and 
genetically investigated 281 patients, almost all pediatric cases, presenting 
with either NF1 (n = 150), only pigmentary features (caf√© au lait macules with 
or without freckling; (n = 95), or clinical suspicion of other RASopathies or 
neurocutaneous disorders (n = 36). The causative variant was identified in 239 
out of the 281 patients analyzed (85.1%), while 42 patients remained undiagnosed 
(14.9%). The NF1 and SPRED1 genes were mutated in 73.3% and 2.8% of cases, 
respectively. The remaining 8.9% carried mutations in different genes associated 
with other disorders. We achieved a molecular diagnosis in 69.5% of cases with 
only pigmentary manifestations, allowing a more appropriate clinical management 
of these patients. Our findings, together with the increasing availability and 
sharing of clinical and genetic data, will help to identify further novel 
genotype-phenotype associations that may have a positive impact on patient 
follow-up.
