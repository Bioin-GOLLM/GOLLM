OBJECTIVE: Describe features unique to head and neck (H&N) necrotizing fasciitis 
(NF) compared to other anatomic regions and specify a prognostic score 
associated with death and descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: Tertiary care, level 1 trauma center.
METHODS: A single-institution database identified 399 confirmed cases of NF 
between 2006 and 2021, 33 of which involved the H&N. Patients with confirmed H&N 
NF were sorted into cohorts based on clinical outcomes, with the "poor" outcomes 
group defined by death and/or DNM.
RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with H&N NF were included. Compared to NF of 
other regions, patients with H&N NF had a significantly lower mortality rate 
(6.06% vs 20.8%, p = .041) and significantly lower rates of obesity (27.3% vs 
63.7%, p < .001) and hypertension (42.4% vs 60.9%, p = .038). Within the H&N 
group, there were 2 deaths (6.06%) and 8 cases of DNM (24.2%). Diabetes was 
associated with poor outcomes (p = .047), as was an abbreviated sequential organ 
failure assessment score for necrotizing fasciitis (nfSOFA) of 2 or greater 
(p = .015).
CONCLUSION: H&N NF is unique among other forms of NF, with a lower mortality 
rate and lower rates of obesity and hypertension in affected patients. Within 
the H&N cohort, worse outcomes were associated with diabetes as well as a nfSOFA 
score of 2 or greater. Timely surgical debridement alongside broad-spectrum 
antibiotics remains the mainstay of treatment for NF; however, this simple 
prognostic score may play a role during the early stages of care for patients 
with H&N NF.
