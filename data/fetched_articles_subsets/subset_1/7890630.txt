We report our studies on the characterization of an approximately 14-kDa lectin, 
termed galectin-1 that we have found to be expressed by Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) cells. cDNA for galectin-1 from CHO cells was prepared and sequenced, and 
a recombinant form (rGal-1) was expressed in Escherichia coli. A mutated form of 
the protein that fully retained activity was also constructed (termed C2SrGal-1) 
in which Cys-2 was changed to Ser-2. rGal-1 was stable in the presence of 
reducing agent, but it quickly lost all activity in the absence of reducing 
agent. In contrast, glycoprotein ligands, such as basement membrane laminin, 
stabilized the activity of rGal-1 in the absence of reducing agent (t1/2 = 2 
weeks). C2SrGal-1 was stable in the presence or absence of either ligand or 
reducing agent. Unexpectedly, galectin-1 was found to exist in a reversible and 
active monomer-dimer equilibrium with a Kd approximately 7 microM and an 
equilibration time of t1/2 approximately 10 h. Addition of haptenic sugars did 
not affect this equilibrium. Galectin-1 isolated from the cytosol of CHO cells 
was found to exist as monomers and dimers. These studies demonstrate that 
galectin-1 binding to a biological ligand stabilizes its activity and that the 
monomer/dimer state of the protein is regulated by lectin concentration.
