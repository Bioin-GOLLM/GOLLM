PURPOSE: Adults with diabetes are at a high risk of developing coronary heart 
disease. The purpose of this study was to assess coronary artery vascular 
function non-invasively in individuals with and without Type 2 diabetes and to 
compare these coronary responses to another microvascular bed (i.e. retina). We 
hypothesized that individuals with diabetes would have impaired coronary 
reactivity and that these impairments would be associated with impairments in 
retinal reactivity.
METHODS: Coronary blood velocity (Transthoracic Doppler Echocardiography) and 
retinal diameters (Dynamic Vessel Analyzer) were measured continuously during 
five minutes of breathing 100% oxygen (i.e. hyperoxia) in 15 persons with Type 2 
diabetes and 15 age-matched control subjects. Using fundus photographs, retinal 
vascular calibers were also measured (central retinal arteriole and venule 
equivalents).
RESULTS: Individuals with diabetes compared to controls had impaired coronary 
(-2.34±16.64% vs. -14.27±10.58%, P=0.03) and retinal (arteriole: -0.04±3.34% vs. 
-3.65±5.07%, P=0.03; venule: -1.65±3.68% vs. -5.23±5.47%, P=0.05) 
vasoconstrictor responses to hyperoxia, and smaller central arteriole-venule 
equivalent ratios (0.83±0.07 vs. 0.90±0.07, P=0.014). Coronary reactivity was 
associated with central retinal arteriole equivalents (r=-0.516, P=0.005) and 
retinal venular reactivity (r=0.387, P=0.034).
CONCLUSION: Diabetes impairs coronary and retinal microvascular function to 
hyperoxia. Impaired vasoconstrictor responses may be part of a systemic diabetic 
vasculopathy, which may contribute to adverse cardiovascular events in 
individuals with diabetes.
