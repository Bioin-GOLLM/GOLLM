To determine which genomic features promote homologous recombination, we created 
a genome-wide map of gene targeting sites. We used an adeno-associated virus 
vector to target identical loci introduced as transcriptionally active 
retroviral vectors. A comparison of ~2,000 targeted and untargeted sites showed 
that targeting occurred throughout the human genome and was not influenced by 
the presence of nearby CpG islands, sequence repeats or DNase I-hypersensitive 
sites. Targeted sites were preferentially located within transcription units, 
especially when the target loci were transcribed in the opposite orientation to 
their surrounding chromosomal genes. We determined the impact of DNA replication 
by mapping replication forks, which revealed a preference for recombination at 
target loci transcribed toward an incoming fork. Our results constitute the 
first genome-wide screen of gene targeting in mammalian cells and demonstrate a 
strong recombinogenic effect of colliding polymerases.
