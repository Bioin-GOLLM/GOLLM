Crocin has been reported to have therapeutic effects on multiple cancers 
including colon cancer, but its specific mechanism is still ambiguous and needs 
to be further explored. Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-116) and 
human normal colonic epithelial cells (CCD841) were first treated with 
increasing concentrations of crocin. Subsequently, with 150 and 200 Î¼M of 
crocin, the cell vitality was examined by cell counting kit 8. Cell apoptosis 
and proliferation were tested by TUNEL staining and colony formation assay, 
respectively. The expression of Ki-67 was assessed by immunofluorescence. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate the level of 
inflammation- and oxidative-related factors. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
production and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were examined by flow 
cytometer. Janus kinase (JAK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 
3 (STAT3), and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) in HCT-116 cells 
were tested by Western blot. Different concentrations of crocin barely affected 
the CCD841 cell vitality, while crocin restrained the HCT-116 cells vitality, 
proliferation and the expression of Ki-67, while inducing apoptosis in a 
concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the contents of inflammation- and 
oxidative-related factors in HCT-116 cells were largely blunted by crocin that 
enhanced ROS and restrained the MMP and suppressed p-JAK2/JAK2, p-STAT3/STAT3, 
and p-ERK/ERK expression in HCT-116 cells. Crocin induced apoptosis and restored 
mitochondrial function in HCT-116 cells via repressing the JAK pathway. If the 
threptic effect works in patients, it could herald a new, effective treatment 
for colon cancer, improving the patients' prognosis and quality of life.
