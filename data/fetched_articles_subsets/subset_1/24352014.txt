In this study we describe a beads-based assay for rapid, sensitive and specific 
isolation and detection of influenza vaccine hemagglutinin (HA). Amplification 
of the hemagglutinin signal resulted from binding of an electrochemical label as 
quantum dots (QDs). For detection of the metal and protein part of the resulting 
HA-CdTe complex, two differential pulse voltammetric methods were used. The 
procedure includes automated robotic isolation and electrochemical analysis of 
the isolated product. The isolation procedure was based on the binding of 
paramagnetic particles (MPs) with glycan (Gly), where glycan was used as the 
specific receptor for linkage of the QD-labeled hemagglutinin.
