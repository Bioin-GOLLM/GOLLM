BACKGROUND: The mechanism underlying aortic dilatation is still unknown. 
Vascular dilatation is thought to be the result of progressive aortic media 
degeneration caused by defective vascular matrix hemostasis, including TGF-β1 
dysregulation. The goal of this study is to draw attention to the potential 
utility of TGF-β1 as a diagnostic marker in non-syndromic patients with aortic 
dilatation.
METHODS: TGF-β1 levels in plasma were measured in 50 patients who had undergone 
surgery and had a tricuspid or bicuspid aortic valve as well as a normal or 
dilated ascending aorta. A pathologist also examined thirty resected aorta 
samples. To specify the reference range of TGF-β1, a control group of 40 
volunteers was enrolled in this study.
RESULTS: We discovered a significant difference in TGF-β1 levels between 
patients with aortic dilatation and the control group (32.5 vs. 63.92; P < 
0.001), as well as between patients with non-dilated aorta but with aortic valve 
disease, and the control group (27.68 vs. 63.92; P < 0.001). There was no 
difference between the dilated ascending aorta group and the non-dilated 
ascending aorta group. We found a poor correlation between TGF-β1 levels and 
ascending aorta diameter as well as the grade of ascending aorta 
histopathological abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: TGF-β1 concentration does not meet the criteria to be a specific 
marker of aortic dilatation, but it is sensitive to aortic 
valvulopathy-aortopathy. A larger patient cohort study is needed to confirm 
these findings.
