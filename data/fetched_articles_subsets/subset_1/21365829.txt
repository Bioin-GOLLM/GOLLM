OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between fibroblast growth factor 3 
(FGF3) gene rs4980700 and rs4631909 polymorphism and non-syndromic oral clefting 
(NSOC).
METHODS: Blood samples from 186 NSOC patients, patients' parents and 200 
controls were collected. DNA was extracted and PCR-restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used to identify genotypes of the samples. 
Case-control analyses and transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and family 
based association test (FBAT) analyses were also carried out.
RESULTS: In case-control analysis, there were significant differences in 
rs4980700 genotype and allele among NSOC patients compared with the control 
group (P < 0.05) and there were significant differences in rs4631909 genotype 
and allele among NSOC patients compared with the control group (P < 0.05), but 
no difference in cleft palate only (P = 0.49). In TDT, the G allele of rs4980700 
had an overtransmission (P < 0.05) and the C allele of rs4631909 had an 
overtransmission (P < 0.05) in NSOC. FBAT analysis also showed a significant 
association between FGF3 gene rs4980700, rs4631909 polymorphism and NSOC.
CONCLUSION: FGF3 gene rs4980700 and rs4631909 polymorphism were associated with 
NSOC.
