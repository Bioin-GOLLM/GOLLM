A polyvinylidene fluoride, sulfonated graphene oxide composite membrane coated 
with polypyrrole (Ppy) and platinum metal (Pt) was fabricated. The 
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis was done to analyze the 
functional groups present in the composite material. Deposition of PPy/Pt 
electrode and surface morphology of PVDF/SGO/Pt/PPy was confirmed by scanning 
electron microscopic (SEM) images. The capacity of ion exchange and proton 
conductivity (PC) of PVDF/SGO/Pt/PPy were 1.4 meq g-1 of dry ion exchanger and 
4.251 × 10-2 S cm-1, respectively. A two-link flexible manipulator based on the 
fabricated ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) membranes was also developed 
where the electromechanical behaviour of a polymer-based actuator provides an 
important step in robotics applications.
