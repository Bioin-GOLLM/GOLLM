G-quadruplexes (G4) are polymorphic four-stranded structures formed by certain 
G-rich nucleic acids in vitro, but the sequence and structural features 
dictating their formation and function in vivo remains uncertain. Here we report 
a structure-function analysis of the complex hCEB1 G4-forming sequence. We 
isolated four G4 conformations in vitro, all of which bear unusual structural 
features: Form 1 bears a V-shaped loop and a snapback guanine; Form 2 contains a 
terminal G-triad; Form 3 bears a zero-nucleotide loop; and Form 4 is a 
zero-nucleotide loop monomer or an interlocked dimer. In vivo, Form 1 and Form 2 
differently account for 2/3rd of the genomic instability of hCEB1 in two 
G4-stabilizing conditions. Form 3 and an unidentified form contribute to the 
remaining instability, while Form 4 has no detectable effect. This work 
underscores the structural polymorphisms originated from a single highly G-rich 
sequence and demonstrates the existence of non-canonical G4s in cells, thus 
broadening the definition of G4-forming sequences.
