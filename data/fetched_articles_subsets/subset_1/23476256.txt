In the crystal of the title compound, C13H20N4, the mol-ecule is nearly planar, 
the dihedral angles between the pyrimidine and the two pyrrolidine rings being 
4.71 (2) and 4.50 (2)°. The crystal features inversion-related dimers linked by 
pairs of C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds generating R2(2)(16) patterns. The dimeric units 
are further linked into C(6) chains via an additional C-H⋯N hydrogen bond.
