Cancer is a multifactorial disease with increasing incidence. There are more 
than 100 different cancer types, defined by location, cell of origin, and 
genomic alterations that influence oncogenesis and therapeutic response. This 
heterogeneity between tumors of different patients and also the heterogeneity 
within the same patient's tumor pose an enormous challenge to cancer treatment. 
In this review, we explore tumor heterogeneity on the longitudinal and the 
latitudinal axis, reviewing current and future approaches to study this 
heterogeneity and their potential to support oncologists in tailoring a 
patient's treatment regimen. We highlight how the ideal of precision oncology is 
reaching far beyond the knowledge of genetic variants to inform clinical 
practice and discuss the technologies and strategies already available to 
improve our understanding and management of heterogeneity in cancer treatment. 
We will focus on integrating multi-omics technologies with suitable in vitro 
models and their proficiency in mimicking endogenous tumor heterogeneity.
