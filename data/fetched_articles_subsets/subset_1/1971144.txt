We report the identification of a missense mutation of Glu280 to Lys280 in the 
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene of a phenylketonuria (PKU) patient in 
Denmark. The mutation is associated with haplotype 1 of the PAH gene in this 
population. This mutation has previously been found in North Africa, where it is 
in linkage disequilibrium with haplotype 38. While it is conceivable that this 
mutation could have been transferred from one haplotype background to another by 
a double crossover or gene conversion event, the fact that the mutation is 
exclusively associated with the two different haplotypes in the two distinct 
populations supports the hypothesis that these two PKU alleles are the result of 
recurrent mutations in the human PAH gene. Furthermore, since the site of 
mutation involves a CpG dinucleotide, they may represent hot spots for mutation 
in the human PAH locus.
