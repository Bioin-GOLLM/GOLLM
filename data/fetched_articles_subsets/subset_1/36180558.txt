Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) encompasses three histological subtypes, including 
clear cell RCC (KIRC), papillary RCC (KIRP), and chromophobe RCC (KICH) each of 
which has different clinical courses, genetic/epigenetic drivers, and 
therapeutic responses. This study aimed to identify the significant mRNAs and 
microRNA panels involved in the pathogenesis of RCC subtypes. The mRNA and 
microRNA transcripts profile were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), 
which were included 611 ccRCC patients, 321 pRCC patients, and 89 chRCC patients 
for mRNA data and 616 patients in the ccRCC subtype, 326 patients in the pRCC 
subtype, and 91 patients in the chRCC for miRNA data, respectively. To identify 
mRNAs and miRNAs, feature selection based on filter and graph algorithms was 
applied. Then, a deep model was used to classify the subtypes of the RCC. 
Finally, an association rule mining algorithm was used to disclose features with 
significant roles to trigger molecular mechanisms to cause RCC subtypes. Panels 
of 77 mRNAs and 73 miRNAs could discriminate the KIRC, KIRP, and KICH subtypes 
from each other with 92% (F1-score ≥ 0.9, AUC ≥ 0.89) and 95% accuracy 
(F1-score ≥ 0.93, AUC ≥ 0.95), respectively. The Association Rule Mining 
analysis could identify miR-28 (repeat count = 2642) and CSN7A (repeat 
count = 5794) along with the miR-125a (repeat count = 2591) and NMD3 (repeat 
count = 2306) with the highest repeat counts, in the KIRC and KIRP rules, 
respectively. This study found new panels of mRNAs and miRNAs to distinguish 
among RCC subtypes, which were able to provide new insights into the underlying 
responsible mechanisms for the initiation and progression of KIRC and KIRP. The 
proposed mRNA and miRNA panels have a high potential to be as biomarkers of RCC 
subtypes and should be examined in future clinical studies.
