Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer entity 
characterized by a heterogeneous genetic landscape and an immunosuppressive 
tumor microenvironment. Recent advances in high-resolution single-cell 
sequencing and spatial transcriptomics technologies have enabled an in-depth 
characterization of both malignant and host cell types and increased our 
understanding of the heterogeneity and plasticity of PDAC in the steady state 
and under therapeutic perturbation. In this Review we outline single-cell 
analyses in PDAC, discuss their implications on our understanding of the disease 
and present future perspectives of multimodal approaches to elucidate its 
biology and response to therapy at the single-cell level.
