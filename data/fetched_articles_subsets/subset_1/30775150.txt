BACKGROUND: BRAF mutations are a common finding in malignant melanoma (MM). 
Nevertheless, apart from their significance as a therapeutic target in advanced 
melanoma, their prognostic value is still debated.
OBJECTIVE: To assess BRAF mutation status in primary, recurrent, or metastatic 
MM and its correlations with histopathological findings.
METHODS: We analyzed 203 samples from 178 consecutive patients: 129 primary 
cutaneous MM, 49 metastatic and recurrent MM of unknown primary site, and 25 
cases of recurrences or metastases of primary MM. BRAF mutations in exon 15 were 
identified with real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or direct sequencing or 
pyrosequencing. Histopathological examination was performed according to 
standard procedures.
RESULTS: We observed a 42.1% prevalence of BRAF mutations at codon 600 among our 
patients, 84% of whom harbored the V600E mutation. Mutations showed a 
statistically significant increase in younger patients (P = 0.011), in ulcerated 
tumors (P = 0.020), and in tumors lacking solar elastosis in adjacent dermis (P 
= 0.008). Mutations were also more common in male patients, as well as in 
primary MMs of the torso, and in nonvisceral metastases, however without 
reaching statistical significance. Logistic regression analysis identified type 
and ulceration as the only significant predictors of BRAF mutation. The highest 
frequencies of mutated BRAF were identified in superficial spreading and nodular 
types, and the lowest in acral lentiginous and lentigo maligna types. In situ MM 
and primary dermal melanoma displayed intermediate frequencies.
CONCLUSION: Frequency of mutated BRAF is type-related and correlated with 
ulceration, a known adverse prognostic factor.
