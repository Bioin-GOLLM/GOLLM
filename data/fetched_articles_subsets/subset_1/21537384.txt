Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by the extensive deposition of amyloid 
beta (Aβ) within the parenchyma and vasculature of the brain. It is hypothesised 
that a dysfunction in Aβ degradation and/or its removal from the brain may 
result in accumulation as plaques. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein-1 (LRP-1) is a multifunctional receptor shown to be involved in 
cholesterol metabolism but also the removal of Aβ from the brain. Its ability to 
transport Aβ from the brain to the periphery has made it an attractive candidate 
for involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have assessed the frequencies of 
9 tag- SNPs and the commonly studied synonymous SNP within exon 3 (rs1799986) in 
a multi-centre AD/control cohort and performed haplotype analysis. We found no 
evidence from a combined total of 412 controls and 1057 AD patients to support 
the involvement of LRP-1 variation, including the most commonly studied variant 
in rs1799986 in conferring genetic susceptibility to increased risk of AD.
