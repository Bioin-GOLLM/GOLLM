BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress and disturbances in serotonergic and dopaminergic 
neurotransmission may play a role in the pathophysiology of delirium.
AIMS: In this study, we investigated levels of amino acids, amino acid ratios 
and levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) as indicators for oxidative stress and 
disturbances in neurotransmission.
METHODS: Plasma levels of amino acids, amino acid ratios and HVA were determined 
in acutely ill patients aged ≥65 years admitted to the wards of Internal 
Medicine and Geriatrics of the Erasmus University Medical Center and the ward of 
Geriatrics of the Havenziekenhuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Differences in 
the biochemical parameters between patients with and without delirium were 
investigated by analysis of variance in models adjusted for age, gender and 
comorbidities.
RESULTS: Of the 86 patients included, 23 had delirium. In adjusted models, 
higher mean phenylalanine/tyrosine ratios (1.34 vs. 1.14, p = 0.028), lower mean 
tryptophan/large neutral amino acids ratios (4.90 vs. 6.12, p = 0.021) and lower 
mean arginine levels (34.8 vs. 45.2 µmol/l, p = 0.022) were found in patients 
with delirium when compared to those without. No differences were found in HVA 
levels between patients with and without delirium.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest disturbed serotonergic 
neurotransmission and an increased status of oxidative stress in patients with 
delirium.
