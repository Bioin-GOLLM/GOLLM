Gamma aminobutyric acid(GABA) is synthesized by glutamate decarboxylase(GAD) in 
β-cells. Regarding Type 1 diabetes(T1D), animal/islet-cell studies found that 
GABA promotes insulin secretion, inhibits α-cell glucagon and dampens immune 
inflammation, while GAD immunization may also preserve β-cells. We evaluated the 
safety and efficacy of oral GABA alone, or combination GABA with GAD, on the 
preservation of residual insulin secretion in recent-onset T1D. Herein we report 
a single-center, double-blind, one-year, randomized trial in 97 children 
conducted March 2015 to June 2019(NCT02002130). Using a 2:1 treatment:placebo 
ratio, interventions included oral GABA twice-daily(n = 41), or oral GABA plus 
two-doses GAD-alum(n = 25), versus placebo(n = 31). The primary outcome, 
preservation of fasting/meal-stimulated c-peptide, was not attained. Of the 
secondary outcomes, the combination GABA/GAD reduced fasting and meal-stimulated 
serum glucagon, while the safety/tolerability of GABA was confirmed. There were 
no clinically significant differences in glycemic control or diabetes antibody 
titers. Given the low GABA dose for this pediatric trial, future investigations 
using higher-dose or long-acting GABA formulations, either alone or with 
GAD-alum, could be considered, although GABA alone or in combination with 
GAD-alum did nor preserve beta-cell function in this trial.
