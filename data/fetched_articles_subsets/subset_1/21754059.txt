In the title compound, C(25)H(19)NO, the quinoline ring system is approximately 
planar, with a maximum deviation of 0.32 (1) Å, and forms dihedral angles of 
80.74 (3) and 81.71 (4)° with the two phenyl rings. In the crystal. mol-ecules 
are stacked along the b axis by way of a C-H⋯π inter-action and a weak π-π 
inter-action between the pyridine and phenyl rings with a centroid-centroid 
distance of 3.6924 (5) Å.
