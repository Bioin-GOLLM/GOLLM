PURPOSE: To examine the association between Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene 
polymorphisms and lumbar disc degeneration (LDD) predisposition.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all the 
relevant studies. The allele/genotype frequencies were extracted from each 
study. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals 
(CI) to assess the strength of the association between the VDR gene 
polymorphisms and LDD risk. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.31 
software.
RESULTS: A total of 23 case-control studies (1835 cases and 1923 controls) were 
included in this systematic review. For the TaqI (rs731236), FokI (rs2228570) 
and ApaI (rs7975232) polymorphisms of VDR gene, nine studies, seven studies, and 
five studies, were eventually included in the meta-analysis, respectively. There 
was no evidence that the VDR gene polymorphisms (TaqI, FokI, ApaI) had 
significant associations with LDD risk.(for TaqI allelic comparison, OR = 1.07, 
95 % CI 0.81-1.40, p = 0.64; for FokI allelic comparison, OR = 1.23, 95 % CI 
0.83-1.82, p = 0.31; for ApaI allelic comparison, OR = 0.79, 95 % CI 0.55-1.14, 
p = 0.20). For stratified analyses by ethnicity and study design, no significant 
associations were found in Caucasian population and Asian population, as well as 
the population-based studies and hospital-based studies under all genetic 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: TaqI, FokI, and ApaI polymorphisms of VDR gene were not 
significantly associated with the predisposition of LDD. Large-scale and 
well-designed international studies are needed to further analyze this field.
