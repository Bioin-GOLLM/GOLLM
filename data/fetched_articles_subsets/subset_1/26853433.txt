Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous 
monogenic form of diabetes characterized by onset of diabetes below 25 years of 
age, autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and primary defect in insulin 
secretion. Mutations in the gene (HNF1A) encoding transcription factor 
hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A (HNF-1A) results in one of the most common forms of 
MODY (MODY3). HNF-1A is mainly enriched in pancreatic β-cells and hepatocytes 
and important for organ development and normal pancreatic function. We here 
report on the functional interrogation of eight missense HNF1A mutations 
associated with MODY3 in South Indian subjects, and the contributing effect of 
common variant (S487N) within HNF1A. Of the eight mutations, three mutations 
(p.R171G, p.G245R and p.R263H), in particular, affected HNF-1A function in 
transfected HeLa cells by reducing both transcriptional activity and nuclear 
localization, possibly due to disruption of the integrity of the three 
dimensional structure. The common variant p.S487N contributed further to the 
loss-of-function of p.R271Q (p.R271Q+p.S487N double mutant), in vitro, on both 
activity and localization. Our data on the first functional study of HNF1A 
mutations in South India subjects confers that the defect of the HNF-1A mutant 
proteins are responsible for MODY3 diabetes in these patients.
