Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) are extremely common, with ~â€‰25% of 
all women experiencing a recurrence within 1 year of their original infection. 
Escherichia coli ST131 is a globally dominant multidrug resistant clone 
associated with high rates of rUTI. Here, we show the dynamics of an ST131 
population over a 5-year period from one elderly woman with rUTI since the 
1970s. Using whole genome sequencing, we identify an indigenous clonal lineage 
(P1A) linked to rUTI and persistence in the fecal flora, providing compelling 
evidence of an intestinal reservoir of rUTI. We also show that the P1A lineage 
possesses substantial plasmid diversity, resulting in the coexistence of 
antibiotic resistant and sensitive intestinal isolates despite frequent 
treatment. Our longitudinal study provides a unique comprehensive genomic 
analysis of a clonal lineage within a single individual and suggests a 
population-wide resistance mechanism enabling rapid adaptation to fluctuating 
antibiotic exposure.
