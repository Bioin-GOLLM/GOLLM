The rhenadicarbaborane carbonyl nitrosyls (C2Bn-3Hn-1)Re(CO)2(NO), (n = 8 to 
12), of interest in drug delivery agents based on the experimentally known 
C2B9H11Re(CO)2(NO) and related species, have been investigated by density 
functional theory. The lowest energy structures of these rhenadicarbaboranes are 
all found to have central ReC2Bn-3 most spherical closo deltahedra in accord 
with their 2n + 2 Wadean skeletal electrons. Carbon atoms are found to be 
located preferentially at degree 4 vertices in such structures. Furthermore, 
rhenium atoms are preferentially located at a highest degree vertex, typically a 
vertex of degree 5. Only for the 9-vertex C2B6H8Re(CO)2(NO) system are 
alternative isocloso deltahedral isomers found within ~8 kcal/mol of the lowest 
energy closo isomer. Such 9-vertex isocloso structures provide a degree 6 vertex 
for the rhenium atom flanked by degree 4 vertices for each carbon atom.
