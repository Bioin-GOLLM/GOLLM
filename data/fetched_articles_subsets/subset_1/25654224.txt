The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is dysregulated in diverse cancers and 
contributes to tumor progression and drug resistance. The first generation of 
mTOR inhibitors have failed to show clinical efficiency in treating pancreatic 
cancers due in part to the feedback relief of the insulin-like growth factor-1 
receptor (IGF-1R)-AKT signaling pathway. The second generation of mTOR 
inhibitors, such as AZD8055, could inhibit AKT activation upon mTOR complex 2 
(mTORC2) inhibition. However, whether this generation of mTOR inhibitors can 
obtain satisfactory activities in pancreatic cancer therapy remains unclear. In 
this study, we found AZD8055 did not show great improvement compared with 
everolimus, AZD8055 induced a temporal inhibition of AKT kinase activities and 
AKT was then rephosphorylated. Additionally, we found that AZD8055-induced 
transient AKT inhibition increased the expression and activation of epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) by releasing its transcriptional factors Fork-head 
box O 1/3a (FoxO1/3a), which might contribute to cell resistance to AZD8055. The 
in vitro and in vivo experiments further indicated the combination of AZD8055 
and erlotinib synergistically inhibited the mTORC1/C2 signaling pathway, 
EGFR/AKT feedback activation, and cell growth, as well as suppressed the 
progression of pancreatic cancer in a xenograft model. This study provides a 
rationale and strategy for overcoming AZD8055 resistance by a combined treatment 
with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in pancreatic cancer therapy.
