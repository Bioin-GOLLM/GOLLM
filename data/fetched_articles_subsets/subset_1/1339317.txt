Cells from patients with the UV-sensitive nucleotide excision repair disorder 
Cockayne's syndrome (CS) have a specific defect in preferential repair of 
lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes. This system permits quick 
resumption of transcription after UV exposure. Here we report the 
characterization of ERCC6, a gene involved in preferential repair in eukaryotes. 
ERCC6 corrects the repair defect of CS complementation group B (CS-B). It 
encodes a protein of 1493 amino acids, containing seven consecutive domains 
conserved between DNA and RNA helicases. The entire helicase region bears 
striking homology to segments in recently discovered proteins involved in 
transcription regulation, chromosome stability, and DNA repair. Mutation 
analysis of a CS-B patient indicates that the gene is not essential for cell 
viability and is specific for preferential repair of transcribed sequences.
