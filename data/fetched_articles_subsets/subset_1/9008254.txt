A putative pathogenic mutation in the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene (Trp64Arg) 
has been reported to be associated with higher diastolic blood pressure as well 
as clinical features of the insulin resistance syndrome and an earlier onset of 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in Pima Indians and Finns. 
Because essential hypertension is reported to be associated with insulin 
resistance, we studied the mutation in Japanese patients with essential 
hypertension to clarify associations of this mutation with hypertension, insulin 
resistance, and basal adrenergic state in hypertensive subjects. The allele 
frequency of the mutation (Arg) in patients with essential hypertension was 
similar to that in control subjects (35 of 202 alleles [17.3%] v 27 of 146 
[18.5%], respectively, P > .7). Insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinemic 
euglycemic glucose clamp and plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were 
also similar in hypertensive subjects with and without the mutation. These data 
suggest that Trp64Arg mutation in the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene does not 
play a major role in susceptibility to essential hypertension or in insulin 
resistance and basal adrenergic state in hypertension.
