BACKGROUND: Morquio-B disease (MBD) is a distinct GLB1-related dysostosis 
multiplex involving the trabecular parts of long bones and spine, presenting a 
mild phenocopy of GALNS-related Morquio-A disease.
METHODS: We analyzed 63 (n = 62 published) cases with MBD to describe their 
clinical, biochemical and genetic features.
RESULTS: Forty-one of 51 cases with informative clinical data had pure MBD 
including progressive growth impairment, kyphoscoliosis, coxa/genua valga, joint 
laxity, platyspondyly, odontoid hypoplasia. Ten of 51 had MBD plus neuronopathic 
manifestations including intellectual/developmental/speech delay, spasticity, 
ataxia dystonia. Corneal clouding, cardiac valve pathology, hepatosplenomegaly, 
spinal cord compression were infrequent and atlantooccipital dislocation, 
cardiomyopathy and cherry red spot were never reported. Urinary 
glycosaminoglycan and oligosaccharide excretion was consistently abnormal. 
Keratan sulphate-derived oligosaccharides were only detected using 
LC-MS/MS-based methods. Residual β-galactosidase activities measured against 
synthetic substrates were 0%-17%.Among 28 GLB1 variants, W273 L (34/94 alleles) 
and T500A (11/94 alleles) occurred most frequently. W273L was invariably 
associated with pure MBD. Pure MBD also was reported in a case homozygous for 
R201H, and in the majority of cases carrying the T500A variant. Homozygous Y333C 
and G438E were associated with MBD plus neuronopathic manifestations. T82M, 
R201H, and H281Y, observed in seven alleles, previously have been found 
sensitive to experimental chaperones.
CONCLUSION: Data provide a basis for future systematic collection of clinical, 
biochemical, morphologic, and genetic data of this ultra-rare condition.
