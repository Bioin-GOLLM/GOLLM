BACKGROUND: Cattle populations are highly amenable to the genetic mapping of 
male reproductive traits because longitudinal data on ejaculate quality and 
dense microarray-derived genotypes are available for thousands of artificial 
insemination bulls. Two young Nordic Red bulls delivered sperm with low 
progressive motility (i.e., asthenospermia) during a semen collection period of 
more than four months. The bulls were related through a common ancestor on both 
their paternal and maternal ancestry. Thus, a recessive mode of inheritance of 
asthenospermia was suspected.
RESULTS: Both bulls were genotyped at 54,001 SNPs using the Illumina BovineSNP50 
Bead chip. A scan for autozygosity revealed that they were identical by descent 
for a 2.98 Mb segment located on bovine chromosome 25. This haplotype was not 
found in the homozygous state in 8557 fertile bulls although five homozygous 
haplotype carriers were expected (P = 0.018). Whole genome-sequencing uncovered 
that both asthenospermic bulls were homozygous for a mutation that disrupts a 
canonical 5' splice donor site of CCDC189 encoding the coiled-coil domain 
containing protein 189. Transcription analysis showed that the derived allele 
activates a cryptic splice site resulting in a frameshift and premature 
termination of translation. The mutated CCDC189 protein is truncated by more 
than 40%, thus lacking the flagellar C1a complex subunit C1a-32 that is supposed 
to modulate the physiological movement of the sperm flagella. The mutant allele 
occurs at a frequency of 2.5% in Nordic Red cattle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study in cattle uncovered that CCDC189 is required for 
physiological movement of sperm flagella thus enabling active progression of 
spermatozoa and fertilization. A direct gene test may be implemented to monitor 
the asthenospermia-associated allele and prevent the birth of homozygous bulls 
that are infertile. Our results have been integrated in the Online Mendelian 
Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) database ( https://omia.org/OMIA002167/9913/ ).

Conflict of interest statement: ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: 
Ejaculates of two asthenospermic bulls were collected by employees of an AI 
center in Finland as part of their routine practice under veterinary 
supervision. Both bulls were eventually culled because their impaired sperm 
motility precluded the use of the collected ejaculates for artificial 
inseminations. The decision to cull the bulls was at the sole discretion of 
representatives of the AI center. Testicular tissue was collected immediately 
after slaughter. Oocytes used for in vitro fertilization experiments were 
collected from offal cow ovaries at a commercial slaughterhouse. No animal 
experiments were performed in this study, and, therefore, approval from an 
ethics committee was not required. CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Two asthenospermic 
bulls were owned by an AI center (Viking Genetics). Consent to participate in 
the study and publication of the results was provided by Søren Borchersen (Head 
of R&D of Viking Genetics) and HS who is also co-author of the manuscript.
