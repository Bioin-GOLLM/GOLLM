BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within precursor microRNAs 
(miRNAs) can affect miRNAs expression, and may be involved in the pathogenesis 
of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This study aimed to investigate potential 
associations between the four precursor miRNA SNPs (miR-146a C > G, miR-149 T > 
C, miR-196a2 T > C, and miR-499 T > C) and susceptibility to pulmonary TB in the 
Chinese Uygur, Kazak, and Southern Han populations.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed on Chinese Uygur (n = 662), Kazak (n 
= 612), and Southern Han (n = 654) populations using the PCR-PFLR method. The 
allele and genotype frequencies for all populations were analyzed. Linkage 
disequilibrium was performed, and different models of inheritance were tested.
RESULTS: The allele and genotype frequencies of the miR-499 SNP were 
significantly different between the TB patients group and the healthy control 
group in the Uygur population, and were found to be codominant, dominant, 
recessive and additive models in association with pulmonary TB. The haplotype 
CTCC showed significant correlation with pulmonary TB. The allele and genotype 
frequencies of miR-146a and miR-196a2 SNPs were significantly different between 
the two groups in the Kazak population. The miR-146a SNP was found to be 
codominant, recessive and additive models, whereas, the miR-196a2 SNP was found 
to be codominant, dominant, and additive models in association with pulmonary 
TB. The haplotypes TCCC and CCCT showed significant correlation with pulmonary 
TB.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that susceptibility to pulmonary TB may be 
closely related to individual differences caused by genetic factors among 
different ethnic groups in China.
