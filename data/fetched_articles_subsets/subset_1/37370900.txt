BACKGROUND: Kazakhstan has a high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 
the Central Asian region. This study aimed to perform genomic characterization 
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains obtained from Kazakhstani patients with 
pre-extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis diagnosed in Kazakhstan.
METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 10 pre-extensively 
drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains from different regions of Kazakhstan. All 
strains had high-confidence resistance mutations according to the resistance 
grading system previously established by the World Health Organization. The 
genome analysis was performed using TB-Profiler, Mykrobe, CASTB, and ResFinder.
RESULTS: Valuable information for understanding the genetic diversity of 
tuberculosis in Kazakhstan can also be obtained from whole-genome sequencing. 
The results from the Phenotypic Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST) of bacterial 
strains were found to be consistent with the drug resistance information 
obtained from genomic data that characterized all isolates as pre-XDR. This 
information can help in developing targeted prevention and control strategies 
based on the local epidemiology of tuberculosis. Furthermore, the data obtained 
from whole-genome sequencing can help in tracing the transmission pathways of 
tuberculosis and facilitating early detection of outbreaks.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from whole-genome sequencing of tuberculosis clinical 
samples in Kazakhstan provide important insights into the drug resistance 
patterns and genetic diversity of tuberculosis in the country. These results can 
contribute to the improvement of tuberculosis control and management programs in 
Kazakhstan.
