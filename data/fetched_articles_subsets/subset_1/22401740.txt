BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The vanilloid receptor TRPV1 is a molecular integrator 
of painful stimuli. Several recent studies suggest that TRPV1 may play a role in 
development and maintenance of chronic pain. In an attempt to determine if 
genotypic variations in TRPV1 gene could be involved in the susceptibility to 
suffer neuropathic pain we have studied genetic variants of human TRPV1 gene.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have studied the distribution of Met315Ile and 
Ile585Val TRPV1 polymorphisms in a total of 440 Caucasian subjects: 232 patients 
with neuropathic pain and 208 healthy subjects matched by age and sex. The 
polymorphisms were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TaqMan 
probes specific for each allele.
RESULTS: Our results show that the distribution of Met315Ile and Ile585Val 
genotypes and alleles is similar in patients with neuropathic pain and in 
healthy subjects. However, the Met315Met genotype is more frequent in females 
diagnosed as suffering neuropathic pain. No differences were observed when we 
segregate the patients according to visual analogue scale values.
CONCLUSIONS: The observation of differences in the distribution of Met315Ile 
TRPV1 genotypes only in females diagnosed of neuropathic pain suggests that this 
polymorphism, together with other physiological factors such as sex, may 
influence individual susceptibility to neuropathic pain.
