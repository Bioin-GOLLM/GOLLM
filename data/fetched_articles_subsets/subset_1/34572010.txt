Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into high-order chromatin structures organized 
in discrete territories inside the cell nucleus, which is surrounded by the 
nuclear envelope acting as a barrier. This chromatin organization is complex and 
dynamic and, thus, determining the spatial and temporal distribution and folding 
of chromosomes within the nucleus is critical for understanding the role of 
chromatin topology in genome function. Primarily focusing on the regulation of 
gene expression, we review here how the genome of Drosophila melanogaster is 
organized into the cell nucleus, from small scale histone-DNA interactions to 
chromosome and lamina interactions in the nuclear space.
