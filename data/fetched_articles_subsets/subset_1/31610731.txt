RATIONALE: There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow cells on 
the gut microbiome and gut barrier function.
OBJECTIVE: We postulated that diabetes mellitus and systemic ACE2 
(angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact 
both the microbiome and gut barrier function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic 
analysis were performed on fecal samples from wild-type, ACE2-/y, Akita (type 1 
diabetes mellitus), and ACE2-/y-Akita mice. Gut barrier integrity was assessed 
by immunofluorescence, and bone marrow cell extravasation into the small 
intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the ACE2-/y-Akita or Akita mice, 
the disrupted barrier was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic 
cells, but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut 
parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the microbiome of 
ACE2-/y-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan-producing 
bacteria. When compared with control cohorts treated with saline, 
intraperitoneal administration of myeloid angiogenic cells significantly 
decreased the microbiome gene expression associated with peptidoglycan 
biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut barrier integrity. Also 
indicative of diabetic gut barrier dysfunction, increased levels of 
peptidoglycan and FABP-2 (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2) were observed 
in plasma of human subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n=21) and type 2 
diabetes mellitus (n=23) compared with nondiabetic controls (n=23). Using human 
retinal endothelial cells, we determined that peptidoglycan activates a 
noncanonical TLR-2 (Toll-like receptor 2) associated MyD88 (myeloid 
differentiation primary response protein 88)-ARNO (ADP-ribosylation factor 
nucleotide-binding site opener)-ARF6 (ADP-ribosylation factor 6) signaling 
cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of 
VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of peptidoglycan on the 
endothelium.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut barrier 
function and dysbiosis in ACE2-/y-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by 
exogenous administration of myeloid angiogenic cells.
