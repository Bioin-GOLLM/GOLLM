The alpha-secretase cleaves in the non-amyloidogenic pathway the amyloid-beta 
protein precursor (AbetaPP) within the region of the amyloid-beta peptides to 
prevent their formation and aggregation in the brain. Members of the ADAM family 
(a disintegrin and metalloprotease) are the main candidates for physiologically 
relevant alpha-secretases. We recently demonstrated that overexpression of 
ADAM10 in mice transgenic for human AbetaPP (ADAM10 x APP[V717I]) alleviated 
functional deficits related to Alzheimer's disease. To further demonstrate that 
this is due to the specific activity of alpha-secretase, we characterized mice 
overexpressing an inactive form of ADAM10 (ADAM10[E384A]; ADAM10-dn). Three 
lines of mice (controls (C57Bl/6 x FVB), APP[V717I[ transgenics and ADAM10-dn x 
APP[V717I] double-transgenics) were investigated with respect to learning and 
memory in the Morris water maze. Double-transgenic mice overexpressing ADAM10-dn 
behaved similar to APP[V717I] overexpressing mice. This provides further 
evidence that ADAM10 in vivo by its enzymatic activity is able to counteract 
cognitive deficits. Stimulation of alpha-secretase activity might thus be a 
suitable approach to study treatment strategies of Alzheimer's disease.
