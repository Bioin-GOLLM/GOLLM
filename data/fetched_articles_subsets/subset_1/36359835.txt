DNA methylation is critical for the normal development and functioning of the 
human brain, such as the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, 
synaptic plasticity, neuronal reparation, learning, and memory. Despite the 
physical stability of DNA and methylated DNA compared to other epigenetic 
modifications, some DNA methylation-based biomarkers have translated into 
clinical practice. Increasing reports indicate a strong association between DNA 
methylation profiles and various clinical outcomes in neurological diseases, 
making DNA methylation profiles valuable as novel clinical markers. In this 
review, we aim to discuss the latest evidence concerning DNA methylation 
alterations in the development of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and 
neuropsychiatric diseases. We also highlighted the relationship of DNA 
methylation alterations with the disease progression and outcome in many 
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and autism.
