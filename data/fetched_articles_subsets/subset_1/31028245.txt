We recently reported that myeloid cell-expressed sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) plays a 
crucial role in M1 macrophage polarization and chemotaxis. Given the prominent 
role of macrophages during wound repair and macrophage heterogeneity, we 
hypothesized that a Sirt6 deficiency in myeloid cells would delay skin wound 
closure by affecting the phenotypes of macrophages in wounds. To address this 
question, a full-thickness excisional lesion was made in the dorsal skin of 
myeloid cell-specific Sirt6 knockout (KO) and wild-type mice. Wound closure was 
delayed in the KO mice, which exhibited less collagen deposition, suppressed 
angiogenesis, and reduced expression of wound healing-related genes compared to 
the wild-type mice. Using immunohistochemical, flow cytometric, and 
gene-expression analyses of macrophage subpopulations from wound tissue, we 
identified increased infiltration of M1 macrophages with a concomitant decrease 
in M2 macrophage numbers in the KO mice compared to the wild-type mice. 
Consistent with the in vivo wound closure defects observed in the KO mice, 
keratinocytes and fibroblasts treated with KO macrophage-derived conditioned 
medium migrated slower than those treated with wild-type macrophage-derived 
conditioned medium. An analysis of downstream signaling pathways indicated that 
impaired Akt signaling underlies the decreased M2 phenotypic switching in KO 
mice. These results suggest that a macrophage phenotypic switch induced by Sirt6 
deficiency contributes to impaired wound healing in mice.
