BACKGROUND: China is one of ten countries with the highest prevalence rate of 
pneumococcal infections. However, there is limited serotype surveillance data 
for Streptococcus pneumoniae, especially from the community or rural regions, 
partly due to limited serotyping capacity because Quellung serotyping is only 
available in few centers in China. The aim of this study was to develop a 
simple, practical and economic pneumococcal serotype prediction strategy 
suitable for future serotype surveillance in China.
METHODS: In this study, 193 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from 
hospitalized children, 96.9 % of whom were < 5 years old. The cpsB sequetyping, 
complemented by selective and modified USA CDC sequential multiplex-PCR, was 
performed on all the isolates, and serotypes 6A-6D specific PCRs were done on 
all serogroup 6 isolates. Based on systematic analysis of available GenBank cpsB 
sequences, we established a more comprehensive cpsB sequence database than 
originally published for cpsB sequetyping. Antibiotic susceptibility of all 
isolates was determined using the disk diffusion or E-test assays.
RESULTS: We built up a comprehensive S. pneumoniae serotype cpsB sequetyping 
database for all the 95 described serotypes first, and then developed a simple 
strategy for serotype prediction based on the improved cpsB sequetyping and 
selective multiplex-PCR. Using the developed serotype prediction strategy, 191 
of 193 isolates were successfully "serotyped", and only two isolates were 
"non-serotypeable". Sixteen serotypes were identified among the 191 
"serotypeable" isolates. The serotype distribution of the isolates from high to 
low was: 19 F (34.7 %), 23 F (17.1 %), 19A (11.9 %), 14 (7.3 %), 15B/15C 
(6.7 %), 6B (6.7 %), 6A (6.2 %), 9 V/9A (1.6 %); serotypes 6C, 3, 15 F/15A, 23A 
and 20 (each 1.1 %); serotypes 10B, 28 F/28A and 34 (each 0.5 %). The prevalence 
of parenteral penicillin resistance was 1.0 % in the non-meningitis isolates and 
88.6 % in meningitis isolates. The total rate of multidrug resistance was 
86.8 %.
CONCLUSIONS: The integrated cpsB sequetyping supplemented with selective mPCR 
and serotypes 6A-6D specific PCRs "cocktail" strategy is practical, simple and 
cost-effective for use in pneumococcal infection serotype surveillance in China. 
For hospitalized children with non-meningitis penicillin-susceptible 
pneumococcal infections, clinicians still can use narrow-spectrum and cheaper 
penicillin, using the parenteral route, rather than using broader-spectrum and 
more expensive antimicrobials.
