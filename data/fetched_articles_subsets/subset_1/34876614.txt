Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has become an attractive target 
in anti-cancer studies in recent years. In this study, we found that a small 
molecule phenylbutenoid dimer NMac1 (Nm23-H1 activator 1), 
(±)-trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-ene, a 
previously identified anti-metastatic agent, has novel anti-proliferative effect 
only under glucose starvation in metastatic breast cancer cells. NMac1 causes 
significant activation of AMPK by decreasing ATP synthesis, lowers mitochondrial 
membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm), and inhibits oxygen consumption rate (OCR) under 
glucose starvation. These effects of NMac1 are provoked by a consequence of 
OXPHOS complex I inhibition. Through the structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
study of NMac1 derivatives, NMac24 was identified as the most effective compound 
in anti-proliferation. NMac1 and NMac24 effectively suppress cancer cell 
proliferation in 3D-spheroid in vivo-like models only under glucose starvation. 
These results suggest that NMac1 and NMac24 have the potential as anti-cancer 
agents having cytotoxic effects selectively in glucose restricted cells.
