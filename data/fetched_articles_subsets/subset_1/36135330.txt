Esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is a life-threatening 
birth defect that often occurs with other major birth defects (EA/TEF+). Despite 
advances in genetic testing, a molecular diagnosis can only be made in a 
minority of EA/TEF+ cases. Here, we analyzed clinical exome sequencing data and 
data from the DECIPHER database to determine the efficacy of exome sequencing in 
cases of EA/TEF+ and to identify phenotypic expansions involving EA/TEF. Among 
67 individuals with EA/TEF+ referred for clinical exome sequencing, a definitive 
or probable diagnosis was made in 11 cases for an efficacy rate of 16% (11/67). 
This efficacy rate is significantly lower than that reported for other major 
birth defects, suggesting that polygenic, multifactorial, epigenetic, and/or 
environmental factors may play a particularly important role in EA/TEF 
pathogenesis. Our cohort included individuals with pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic variants that affect TCF4 and its downstream target NRXN1, and FANCA, 
FANCB, and FANCC, which are associated with Fanconi anemia. These cases, 
previously published case reports, and comparisons to other EA/TEF genes made 
using a machine learning algorithm, provide evidence in support of a potential 
pathogenic role for these genes in the development of EA/TEF.
