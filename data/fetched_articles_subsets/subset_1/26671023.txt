BACKGROUND: We assessed the evidence for association between 23 recently 
reported prostate cancer variants and early-onset prostate cancer and the 
aggregate value of 63 prostate cancer variants for predicting early-onset 
disease using 931 unrelated men diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to age 56 
years and 1,126 male controls.
METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to test the evidence for 
association between the 23 new variants and early-onset prostate cancer. 
Weighted and unweighted sums of total risk alleles across these 23 variants and 
40 established variants were constructed. Weights were based on previously 
reported effect size estimates. Receiver operating characteristic curves and 
forest plots, using defined cut-points, were constructed to assess the 
predictive value of the burden of risk alleles on early-onset disease.
RESULTS: Ten of the 23 new variants demonstrated evidence (P < 0.05) for 
association with early-onset prostate cancer, including four that were 
significant after multiple test correction. The aggregate burden of risk alleles 
across the 63 variants was predictive of early-onset prostate cancer (AUC = 0.71 
using weighted sums), especially in men with a high burden of total risk 
alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: A high burden of risk alleles is strongly associated with 
early-onset prostate cancer.
IMPACT: Our results provide the first formal replication for several of these 23 
new variants and demonstrate that a high burden of common-variant risk alleles 
is a major risk factor for early-onset prostate cancer. Cancer Epidemiol
