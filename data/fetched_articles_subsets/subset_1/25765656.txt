A variety of DNA lesions, secondary DNA structures or topological stress within 
the DNA template may lead to stalling of the replication fork. Recovery of such 
forks is essential for the maintenance of genomic stability. The 
structure-specific endonuclease Mus81-Mms4 has been implicated in processing DNA 
intermediates that arise from collapsed forks and homologous recombination. 
According to previous genetic studies, the Srs2 helicase may play a role in the 
repair of double-strand breaks and ssDNA gaps together with Mus81-Mms4. In this 
study, we show that the Srs2 and Mus81-Mms4 proteins physically interact in 
vitro and in vivo and we map the interaction domains within the Srs2 and Mus81 
proteins. Further, we show that Srs2 plays a dual role in the stimulation of the 
Mus81-Mms4 nuclease activity on a variety of DNA substrates. First, Srs2 
directly stimulates Mus81-Mms4 nuclease activity independent of its helicase 
activity. Second, Srs2 removes Rad51 from DNA to allow access of Mus81-Mms4 to 
cleave DNA. Concomitantly, Mus81-Mms4 inhibits the helicase activity of Srs2. 
Taken together, our data point to a coordinated role of Mus81-Mms4 and Srs2 in 
processing of recombination as well as replication intermediates.
