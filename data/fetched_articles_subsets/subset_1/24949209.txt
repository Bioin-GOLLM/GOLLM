A 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral visual decline was diagnosed to 
have Bietti's crystalline dystrophy (BCD). Fluorescein angiography revealed 
bilateral petaloid type late hyperfluorescence implicating concurrent cystoid 
macular edema (CME). Optical coherence tomography exhibited cystoid foveal 
lacunas OU. During the follow-up of six years, intraretinal crystals reduced in 
amount but CME persisted angiographically and tomographically. CME is among the 
rare macular features of BCD including subfoveal sensorial detachment, 
subretinal neovascular membrane, and macular hole.
