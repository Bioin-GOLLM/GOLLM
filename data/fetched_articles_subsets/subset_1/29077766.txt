BACKGROUND: Aim was to determine the dynamics of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMC)- associated total HIV-1 DNA in successfully ART-treated HIV/HCV 
co-infected patients receiving DAA treatment and to explore possible virological 
hypotheses underlying the phenomenon.
METHODS: Longitudinal, single-centre study measuring total HIV-1 DNA before the 
start of DAA, at the end of treatment (EOT), and 3 months after treatment. 
Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess factors associated 
with HIV-1 DNA increase ≥0.5 Log copies/million PBMC. Episomal 2-LTR forms, 
residual HIV-1 viremia and proviral DNA quasispecies evolution were also 
investigated.
RESULTS: 119 successfully ART-treated HIV/HCV co-infected patients were 
included. Median baseline HIV-1 DNA was 3.84 Log copies/million PBMC (95%CI 
3.49-4.05), and no significant variation with respect to baseline was found at 
EOT and after 3 months of DAA termination. In 17% of cases an increase ≥0.5 Log 
copies/million PBMC was observed at EOT compared to baseline. HIV-1 DNA increase 
was independently associated with lower baseline HIV-1 DNA, longer HIV 
suppression, raltegravir-based ART and previous exposure to interferon/ribavirin 
for HCV treatment. In none of the patients with HIV-1 DNA increase, 2-LTR forms 
were detected at baseline, while in 2 cases 2-LTR forms were found at EOT, 
without association with residual HIV-1 RNA viremia. No evidence of viral 
evolution was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In successfully ART-treated HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving 
DAA, PBMC-associated total HIV-1 DNA was quite stable over time, but some 
patients showed a considerable increase at EOT when compared to baseline. A 
significantly higher risk of HIV DNA increase was found, in presence of lower 
cellular HIV reservoir at baseline. Activation of replicative-competent virus 
generating new rounds of viral replication seems unlikely, while mobilization of 
cell-associated HIV from tissue reservoirs could be hypothesized.
