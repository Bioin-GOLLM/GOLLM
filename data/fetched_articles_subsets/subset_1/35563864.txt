Three-dimensional genome organization represents an additional layer in the 
epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Active transcription controlled by 
enhancers or super-enhancers has been extensively studied. Enhancers or 
super-enhancers can recruit activators or co-activators to activate target gene 
expression through long-range chromatin interactions. Chromatin interactions and 
phase separation play important roles in terms of enhancer or super-enhancer 
functioning. Silencers are another major type of cis-regulatory element that can 
mediate gene regulation by turning off or reducing gene expression. However, 
compared to active transcription, silencer studies are still in their infancy. 
This review covers the current knowledge of human silencers, especially the 
roles of chromatin interactions and phase separation in silencers. This review 
also proposes future directions for human silencer studies.
