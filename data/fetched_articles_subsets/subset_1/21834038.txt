Nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (NSOC) are the most common developmental anomalies 
in human beings. Recently, a large-scale genome-wide association study 
identified two novel NSOC susceptibility loci: rs13041247 near MAFB and rs560426 
near ABCA4. In the present study, we recruited 396 NSOC cases and 384 healthy 
controls to replicate their associations with risk of NSOC as well as their 
subgroups in a Chinese Han population. We found the overall genotype and allele 
frequencies of rs13041247, but not rs560426 were significantly different between 
cases and controls. Further logistic regression analysis showed rs13041247 CT, 
CC, and CT/CC were associated with decreased NSOC susceptibility, compared with 
rs13041247 TT wide-type homozygote. Moreover, the apparent protection against 
cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), cleft lip with cleft palate 
(CLP), and cleft lip only (CLO) was also identified in stratified analysis. 
However, none of any rs560426 genotypes or alleles was associated with risk of 
NSOC or their subgroups. Taken together, our findings confirmed the contribution 
of MAFB in the etiology of NSOC in a Chinese Han population.
