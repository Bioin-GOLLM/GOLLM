BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and survivin are indicators for tumor 
stage and metastasis, as well as epitheliomesenchymal transition, in various 
cancers, including hepatocellular cancer (HCC).
AIM: To explore the potential of survivin-positive CTCs, specifically, as a 
marker for tumor progression in HCC patients.
METHODS: We examined the survivin expression pattern in CTCs obtained from 179 
HCC patients, and investigated the in vitro effects of survivin silencing and 
overexpression on the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. CTC count and 
survivin expression in patient samples were examined using RNA in situ 
hybridization.
RESULTS: All 179 patients were positive for CTC markers, and 94.41% of the CTCs 
were positive for survivin. The CTC and survivin-positive CTC counts were 
significantly higher in the HCC patients than in the normal controls, and were 
significantly associated with tumor stage and degree of differentiation. 
Further, survivin overexpression was found to induce HepG2 cell proliferation, 
reduce apoptosis, and improve invasive ability.
CONCLUSION: Survivin shows upregulated expression (indicative of anti-apoptotic 
effects) in HCC. Thus, survivin-positive CTCs are promising as a predictor of 
HCC prognosis and metastasis, and their accurate measurement may be useful for 
the management of this cancer.
