Central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) is a prominent infiltration reason for 
therapy failing in acute leukemia. Recurrence rates and the prognosis have 
alleviated with current prophylactic regimens. However, the accurate 
stratification of relapse risk and treatment regimens for relapsed or refractory 
patients remain clinical challenges yet to be solved. Recently, with 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and chimeric antigen receptor-T 
(CAR-T) cellular therapy showing encouraging effects in some CNSL patients, 
advances in treating CNSL have already been reported. The development of 
molecular targeted agents as well as antibody-based drugs will provide patients 
with more personalized treatment. This article summarized recent research 
developments about risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment in adults 
with CNSL.
