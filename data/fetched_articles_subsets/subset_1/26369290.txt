During surveillance for bovine diarrhea of unknown causes in Japanese black 
cattle in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, we found two types of novel kobu-like 
viruses in fecal samples of calves. Sequence analyses revealed that they had L 
protein and 2A protein with H-box/NC sequence motif, which are present in 
kobuviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were related to 
kobuviruses; however, they clustered apart from other kobuviruses. In the 
prevalence study of two types of novel kobu-like viruses, 16.9% and 10.4% 
prevalence of these viruses were observed in the feces of diarrheal calves in 
this area.
