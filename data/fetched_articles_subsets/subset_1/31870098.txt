Increasing knowledge about the molecular profile of tumors has led to 
personalized treatment for achieving better outcomes in patients with nonsmall 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, finding exact somatic genomic changes of 
tumor has gained great importance. On the other hand, crescendoing needs to 
actual tumor tissue at different time points during cancer treatment may produce 
major discomfort for NSCLC patients. Tumor genomes can be reconstructed by 
information obtained from circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) of 
peripheral blood. cfDNA may be represented as a suitable alternative test  for 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation detection in these patients. 
This study aimed to assess validity of cfDNA in somatic EGFR mutation 
identification in Iranian NSCLC cases.
METHODS: Somatic mutation of EGFR gene was studied in both tissue specimens and 
plasma. Then, mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and 
sequencing.
RESULTS: We observed a high concordance (90%) between tissue samples and cfDNA 
for EGFR gene mutation.  The sensitivity, accuracy, and positive precision value 
were 90%, 90% and 100%, respectively. A false negative rate of 10% was also 
demonstrated in this study.
CONCLUSION: We established sensitive methods for detecting EGFR gene mutation 
which may be very useful in clinical practice.<br />.
