Although CDKN2A is the most frequent high-risk melanoma susceptibility gene, the 
underlying genetic factors for most melanoma-prone families remain unknown. 
Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a rare variant that arose as a 
founder mutation in the telomere shelterin gene POT1 (chromosome 7, 
g.124493086C>T; p.Ser270Asn) in five unrelated melanoma-prone families from 
Romagna, Italy. Carriers of this variant had increased telomere lengths and 
numbers of fragile telomeres, suggesting that this variant perturbs telomere 
maintenance. Two additional rare POT1 variants were identified in all cases 
sequenced in two separate Italian families, one variant per family, yielding a 
frequency for POT1 variants comparable to that for CDKN2A mutations in this 
population. These variants were not found in public databases or in 2,038 
genotyped Italian controls. We also identified two rare recurrent POT1 variants 
in US and French familial melanoma cases. Our findings suggest that POT1 is a 
major susceptibility gene for familial melanoma in several populations.
