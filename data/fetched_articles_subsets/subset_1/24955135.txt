BACKGROUND: The enumeration of chemical graphs (molecular graphs) satisfying 
given constraints is one of the fundamental problems in chemoinformatics and 
bioinformatics because it leads to a variety of useful applications including 
structure determination and development of novel chemical compounds.
RESULTS: We consider the problem of enumerating chemical graphs with monocyclic 
structure (a graph structure that contains exactly one cycle) from a given set 
of feature vectors, where a feature vector represents the frequency of the 
prescribed paths in a chemical compound to be constructed and the set is 
specified by a pair of upper and lower feature vectors. To enumerate all 
tree-like (acyclic) chemical graphs from a given set of feature vectors, Shimizu 
et al. and Suzuki et al. proposed efficient branch-and-bound algorithms based on 
a fast tree enumeration algorithm. In this study, we devise a novel method for 
extending these algorithms to enumeration of chemical graphs with monocyclic 
structure by designing a fast algorithm for testing uniqueness. The results of 
computational experiments reveal that the computational efficiency of the new 
algorithm is as good as those for enumeration of tree-like chemical compounds.
CONCLUSIONS: We succeed in expanding the class of chemical graphs that are able 
to be enumerated efficiently.
