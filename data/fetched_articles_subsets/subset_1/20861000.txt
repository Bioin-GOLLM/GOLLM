The PD-(D/E)XK type II restriction endonuclease ThaI cuts the target sequence 
CG/CG with blunt ends. Here, we report the 1.3 Å resolution structure of the 
enzyme in complex with substrate DNA and a sodium or calcium ion taking the 
place of a catalytic magnesium ion. The structure identifies Glu54, Asp82 and 
Lys93 as the active site residues. This agrees with earlier bioinformatic 
predictions and implies that the PD and (D/E)XK motifs in the sequence are 
incidental. DNA recognition is very unusual: the two Met47 residues of the ThaI 
dimer intercalate symmetrically into the CG steps of the target sequence. They 
approach the DNA from the minor groove side and penetrate the base stack 
entirely. The DNA accommodates the intercalating residues without nucleotide 
flipping by a doubling of the CG step rise to twice its usual value, which is 
accompanied by drastic unwinding. Displacement of the Met47 side chains from the 
base pair midlines toward the downstream CG steps leads to large and 
compensating tilts of the first and second CG steps. DNA intercalation by ThaI 
is unlike intercalation by HincII, HinP1I or proteins that bend or repair DNA.
