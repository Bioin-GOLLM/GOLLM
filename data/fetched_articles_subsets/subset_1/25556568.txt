Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) in mice and rats are primed pluripotent stem cells 
(PSCs). They barely contribute to chimeric embryos when injected into 
blastocysts. Reprogramming of EpiSCs to embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells 
(rESCs) may occur in response to LIF-STAT3 signaling; however, low reprogramming 
efficiency hampers potential use of rESCs in generating chimeras. Here, we 
describe dramatic improvement of conversion efficiency from primed to naive-like 
PSCs through upregulation of E-cadherin in the presence of the cytokine LIF. 
Analysis revealed that blocking nuclear localization of β-CATENIN with 
small-molecule inhibitors significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency of 
mouse EpiSCs. Although activation of Wnt/β-catenin signals has been thought 
desirable for maintenance of naive PSCs, this study provides the evidence that 
inhibition of nuclear translocation of β-CATENIN enhances conversion of mouse 
EpiSCs to naive-like PSCs (rESCs). This affords better understanding of gene 
regulatory circuits underlying pluripotency and reprogramming of PSCs.
