RAD51 paralogs are key components of the homologous recombination (HR) 
machinery. Mouse mutants have been reported for four of the canonical RAD51 
paralogs, and each of these mutants exhibits embryonic lethality, although at 
different gestational stages. However, the phenotype of mice deficient in the 
fifth RAD51 paralog, XRCC3, has not been reported. Here we report that Xrcc3 
knockout mice exhibit midgestational lethality, with mild phenotypes beginning 
at about E8.25 but severe developmental abnormalities evident by E9.0-9.5. The 
most obvious phenotypes are small size and a failure of the embryo to turn to a 
fetal position. A knockin mutation at a key ATPase residue in the Walker A box 
results in embryonic lethality at a similar stage. Death of knockout mice can be 
delayed a few days for some embryos by homozygous or heterozygous Trp53 
mutation, in keeping with an important role for XRCC3 in promoting genome 
integrity. Given that XRCC3 is a unique member of one of two RAD51 paralog 
complexes with RAD51C, these results demonstrate that both RAD51 paralog 
complexes are required for mouse development.
