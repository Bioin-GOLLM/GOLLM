Adaptation to early training and racing (i.e. precocity), which is highly 
variable in racing Thoroughbreds, has implications for the selection and 
training of horses. We hypothesised that precocity in Thoroughbred racehorses is 
heritable. Age at first sprint training session (work day), age at first race 
and age at best race were used as phenotypes to quantify precocity. Using 
high-density SNP array data, additive SNP heritability (hSNP2) was estimated to 
be 0.17, 0.14 and 0.17 for the three traits respectively. In genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) for age at first race and age at best race, a 1.98-Mb 
region on equine chromosome 18 (ECA18) was identified. The most significant 
association was with the myostatin (MSTN) g.66493737C>T SNP (P = 5.46 × 10-12 
and P = 1.89 × 10-14 respectively). In addition, two SNPs on ECA1 (g.37770220G>A 
and g.37770305T>C) within the first intron of the serotonin receptor gene HTR7 
were significantly associated with age at first race and age at best race. 
Although no significant associations were identified for age at first work day, 
the MSTN:g.66493737C>T SNP was among the top 20 SNPs in the GWAS 
(P = 3.98 × 10-5 ). Here we have identified variants with potential roles in 
early adaptation to training. Although there was an overlap in genes associated 
with precocity and distance aptitude (i.e. MSTN), the HTR7 variants were more 
strongly associated with precocity than with distance. Because HTR7 is closely 
related to the HTR1A gene, previously implicated in tractability in young 
Thoroughbreds, this suggests that behavioural traits may influence precocity.
