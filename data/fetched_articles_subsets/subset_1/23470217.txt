Toxoplasma gondii is sensitive to bulky pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP) 
inhibitors due to the presence of a Gly gatekeeper in the essential calcium 
dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1). Here we synthesized a number of new 
derivatives of 3-methyl-benzyl-PP (3-MB-PP, or 1). The potency of PP analogues 
in inhibiting CDPK1 enzyme activity in vitro (low nM IC(50) values) and blocking 
parasite growth in host cell monolayers in vivo (low Î¼M EC(50) values) were 
highly correlated and occurred in a CDPK1-specific manner. Chemical modification 
of the PP scaffold to increase half-life in the presence of microsomes in vitro 
led to identification of compounds with enhanced stability while retaining 
activity. Several of these more potent compounds were able to prevent lethal 
infection with T. gondii in the mouse model. Collectively, the strategies 
outlined here provide a route for development of more effective compounds for 
treatment of toxoplasmosis and perhaps related parasitic diseases.
