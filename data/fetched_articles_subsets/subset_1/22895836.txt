It has been controversial whether mtDNA mutations are responsible for 
tumorigenesis and for the process to develop metastases. To clarify this issue, 
we established trans-mitochondrial cybrids with mtDNA exchanged between mouse 
tumor cells that possess high and low metastatic potential. The results revealed 
that the G13997A mutation in the ND6 gene of mtDNA from highly metastatic tumor 
cells reversibly controlled development of metastases by overproduction of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS). The transmitochondrial model mice possessing 
G13997A mtDNA showed symptoms of impaired glucose tolerability, suggesting that 
ROS generated mtDNA mutations can regulate not only metastatic potential, but 
also age-associated disorders such as diabetes. We also identified other mtDNA 
mutations that affect metastatic potential but the mechanisms are independent of 
ROS production. The mtDNA-mediated reversible control of metastasis and 
age-associated disorders are novel functions of mtDNA, and suggests that ROS 
scavengers may be therapeutically effective to suppress these phenotypes.
