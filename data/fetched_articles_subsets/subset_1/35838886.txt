Novel SARS-CoV-2 claimed a large number of human lives. The main proteins for 
viral entry into host cells are SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VYB) and 
spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 (spike RBD-ACE2; PDB ID: 6M0J). 
Currently, specific therapies are lacking globally. This study was designed to 
investigate the bioactive components from Moringa oleifera leaf (MOL) extract by 
gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and their binding interactions with 
spike glycoprotein and spike RBD-ACE2 protein through computational analysis. 
GC-MS-based analysis unveiled the presence of thirty-seven bioactive components 
in MOL extract, viz. polyphenols, fatty acids, terpenes/triterpenes, 
phytosterols/steroids, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. These bioactive 
phytoconstituents showed potential binding with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 
and spike RBD-ACE2 protein through the AutoDock 4.2 tool. Further by using 
AutoDock 4.2 and AutoDock Vina, the top sixteen hits (binding 
energy ≥  - 6.0 kcal/mol) were selected, and these might be considered as active 
biomolecules. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation was determined by the 
Desmond module. Interestingly two biomolecules, namely β-tocopherol with spike 
glycoprotein and β-sitosterol with spike RBD-ACE2, displayed the best 
interacting complexes and low deviations during 100-ns simulation, implying 
their strong stability and compactness. Remarkably, both β-tocopherol and 
β-sitosterol also showed the drug- likeness with no predicted toxicity. In 
conclusion, these findings suggested that both compounds β-tocopherol and 
β-sitosterol may be developed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. The current findings of 
in silico approach need to be optimized using in vitro and clinical studies to 
prove the effectiveness of phytomolecules against SARS-CoV-2.
