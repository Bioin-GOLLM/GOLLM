Over the past decade, advances in genetic testing, particularly the advent of 
next-generation sequencing, have led to a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of 
molecular diseases and disorders. Despite our present collective ability to 
interrogate more than 90% of the human genome, portions of the genome have 
eluded us, resulting in stagnation of diagnostic yield with existing 
methodologies. Here we show how application of a new technology, long-read 
sequencing, has the potential to improve molecular diagnostic rates. Whole 
genome sequencing by long reads was able to cover 98% of next-generation 
sequencing dead zones, which are areas of the genome that are not interpretable 
by conventional industry-standard short-read sequencing. Through the ability of 
long-read sequencing to unambiguously call variants in these regions, we 
discovered an immunodeficiency due to a variant in IKBKG in a subject who had 
previously received a negative genome sequencing result. Additionally, we 
demonstrate the ability of long-read sequencing to detect small variants on par 
with short-read sequencing, its superior performance in identifying structural 
variants, and thirdly, its capacity to determine genomic methylation defects in 
native DNA. Though the latter technical abilities have been demonstrated, we 
demonstrate the clinical application of this technology to successfully identify 
multiple types of variants using a single test.
