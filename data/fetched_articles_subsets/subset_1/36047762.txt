The target of rapamycin complex I (TORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism 
in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that nitrogen and amino acid signals 
activate TORC1 via the highly conserved small GTPases, Gtr1/2 (RagA/C in 
humans), and the GTPase activating complex SEAC/GATOR. However, it remains 
unclear if, and how, other proteins/pathways regulate TORC1 in simple eukaryotes 
like yeast. Here, we report that the previously unstudied GPCR-like protein, 
Ait1, binds to TORC1-Gtr1/2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and holds TORC1 around 
the vacuole during log-phase growth. Then, during amino acid starvation, Ait1 
inhibits TORC1 via Gtr1/2 using a loop that resembles the RagA/C-binding domain 
in the human protein SLC38A9. Importantly, Ait1 is only found in the 
Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae, two closely related families of yeast that have 
lost the ancient TORC1 regulators Rheb and TSC1/2. Thus, the TORC1 circuit found 
in the Saccharomycetaceae/codaceae, and likely other simple eukaryotes, has 
undergone significant rewiring during evolution.
