ATR-X syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation syndrome characterized by 
mental retardation, alpha thalassaemia and distinct facial features which 
include microcephaly, frontal hair upsweep, epicanthic folds, small triangular 
nose, midface hypoplasia and carp-shaped mouth. Here we report two brothers with 
clinical features of ATR-X syndrome, in whom a novel missense (C>T) mutation was 
identified in exon 31 of the ATRX gene.
