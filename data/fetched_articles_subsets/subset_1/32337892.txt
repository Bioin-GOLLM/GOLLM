We examined a status of fibrosarcoma arising in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans 
of 64-year-old male patient. A dermal, solid, grayish-yellow, desmin-negative 
trichrome-bluish tumor measured 1.5 cm in diameter pT1a (edition 8 pTNM). It was 
composed of spindle cells. It was consistent with dermatofibrosarcoma 
protuberans (ICD-O3: 8832/3) in areas of low mitotic activity, low atypia and 
sustained CD34 positivity. CD34-negative texture with high mitotic index and 
atypia was consistent with the high grade sarcoma apparently of fibrous origin, 
given category of poorly differentiated fibrosarcoma. The high grade component 
was graded (G3) and scored according to French Federation of Cancer Centers 
Sarcoma Group (FNCLCC): total score of 6 points: tumor differentiation: 3 points 
+ Mitotic count: 3 points (up to 26 mitoses/ 10HPF in high-grade fields), + no 
necrosis: 0 points. In low grade sarcomatous component ADAMTS20 (NM_025003: 
c.1661C>T, p.P554L) NF1 (NM_001042492: c. 2173G>T, p.E725X) and PKHD1 
(NM_138694: c. 11074C>T, p.R3692X) were revealed with following allelic 
frequencies: 25%, 27% and 17%. In high grade component allelic frequencies of 
the same mentioned mutations were 30%, 30% and 14% respectively. In the light of 
our findings, none of detected mutations can be regarded as a mutation that 
would definitely induce phenotype of high malignancy, because ADAMTS20, NF1 and 
PKHD1 mutations were detected both in high grade sarcoma and in low grade areas 
of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. It also points that these mutations appeared 
on early stages of tumor development.
