PURPOSE: To investigate potential indicators of patients' waiting time and 
length of stay in emergency departments (ED) at the Ministry of Health (MOH) 
hospitals in order to determine the causes of delayed patient care and to 
recommend clinical implications to achieve a better ED system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This exploratory study was conducted in the EDs at four 
tertiary hospitals of MOH. A random sample of 1360 people was tested from 
December 2019 to February 2020. Data included patient Canadian Triage Acuity and 
System (CTAS) level, registration time, triage time, physician examination time, 
decision time, and disposition time. Descriptive statistics, multivariate 
analysis, multiple linear regression analysis and Pearson correlation were used 
according to SPSS (version 24).
RESULTS: The findings showed that 89.6% of total emergency patients were 
categorized as levels 3, 4 and 5. Around 73.5% of emergency patients stayed less 
than 4 hours due to registration or triage to disposition, while 26.5% of those 
patients stayed more than 4 hours.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients' total stay in EDs was less than 4 hours. 
According to ED international standard of length of stay, this is appropriate. 
The highest effective indicator in total length of stay was the decision to 
disposition time in EDs.
