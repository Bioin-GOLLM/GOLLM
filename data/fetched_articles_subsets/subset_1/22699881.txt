To examine the association between glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) gene 
Pro198Leu polymorphism with the development and progression of prostate cancer. 
A comprehensive search was conducted to identify all case-control studies of 
GPx1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer. Statistical analysis was performed with 
the software program Stata, version 11.0, and Review Manage, version 4.2. A 
total of 7 eligible studies relating the GPx1 polymorphism to the risk of 
prostate cancer were identified. The results indicated no significant 
association between GPx1 polymorphisms and prostate cancer susceptibility in the 
dominant model (random effects OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.48-1.18), recessive model 
(random effects OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.22-1.01) and co-dominant genetic model 
(random effects OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.43-1.21). For the analysis of GPx1 
polymorphism and progression of prostate cancer, no significant association were 
found in the dominant model (fixed effects OR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.95-1.52), 
recessive model (fixed effects OR 0.69, 95 % CI 0.48-1.00) and co-dominant 
genetic model (fixed effects OR 0.95, 95 % CI 0.79-1.15). Egger's test showed 
that publication bias was not present in all the comparisons.
