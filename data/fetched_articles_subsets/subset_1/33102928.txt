While most organisms utilize 20 canonical amino acid building blocks for protein 
synthesis, adding additional candidates to the amino acid repertoire can greatly 
facilitate the investigation and manipulation of protein structures and 
functions. In this study, we report the generation of completely autonomous 
organisms with a 21st ncAA, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP). Like 20 canonical amino 
acids, 5-hydroxytryptophan can be biosynthesized in vivo from simple carbon 
sources and is subsequently incorporated into proteins in response to the amber 
stop codon. Using this unnatural organism, we have prepared a single-chain 
immunoglobulin variable fragment conjugated with a fluorophore and demonstrated 
the utility of these autonomous cells to monitor oxidative stress. Creation of 
this and other cells containing the 21st amino acid will provide an opportunity 
to generate proteins and organisms with novel activities, as well as to 
determine the evolutionary consequences of using additional amino acid 
buildings.
