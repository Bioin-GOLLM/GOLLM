BACKGROUND: Half of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop CF-related diabetes 
(CFRD). CFRD contributes to worsened pulmonary function and malnutrition. We 
undertook this study to determine the effect of cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
regulator (CFTR) modulators on CRFD.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of adults with CF who followed in the 
CF clinic at Oklahoma University Medical Center. We collected data for age at 
diagnosis of CF and CFRD, CF mutations present, first date of ivacaftor therapy 
either alone or in combination, insulin use, pulmonary function, body mass index 
data, and home glucose monitoring results. Clinical resolution of CFRD was taken 
as discontinuation of routine insulin and resolution of high interstitial home 
glucose values.
RESULTS: We identified 69 adult CF patients, of whom 31 had CFRD. Among these 14 
CFRD patients taking ivacaftor alone or in combination, four patients completely 
stopped using insulin. Another patient went from three times a day pre-prandial 
insulin to using insulin once a week. Home blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c 
values supported resolution of CFRD. Three patients continued to have 
hypoglycemia despite stopping insulin. No CFRD patient not taking CFTR 
modulators markedly changed the insulin regimen. Pulmonary function was 
preserved in those patients with resolved CFRD (FEV1 +6.75% ±7.6), whereas it 
worsened in CFRD patients who either were not taking CFTR modulators (FEV1 
-2.09% ±3.9) or who had no response of CFRD status (FEV1 -4.9% ±7.6).
CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of patients on CFTR modulator therapy had 
resolution or near resolution of CFRD.
