BACKGROUND: Studies on the association of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) 
with osteoporosis, and bone mineral density (BMD) have been inconsistent. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the association of a history of GDM with 
osteoporosis, BMD, and trabecular bone score (TBS) in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Postmenopausal women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES) between 2007 and 2010, between 2013 and 2014, and between 2017 
and 2018 were retrospectively included in this cross-sectional study. The 
logistic regression model was used to explore the relationship between GDM and 
osteoporosis, and a weighted linear regression model was applied to investigate 
the association between GDM and total femoral BMD, femoral neck BMD, and total 
TBS. Subgroup analysis of the association between GDM and osteoporosis was 
performed according to age, body mass index (BMI), and DM (yes or no).
RESULTS: Of the 6732 women included, 253 women (3.76%) had GDM. No significant 
differences in total femoral BMD, femoral neck BMD, and total TBS were observed 
between postmenopausal women with and without a history of GDM. However, a 
history of GDM was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women [odds ratio (OR): 11.18, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 
3.64 to 34.27, P < 0.001]. There was no significant difference between a history 
of GDM and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women whom BMI is normal and 
overweight women. However, there was an association between a history of GDM and 
osteoporosis in postmenopausal obese women (OR: 26.57, 95% CI 10.23 to 68.98, 
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A history of GDM was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis 
in postmenopausal women, particularly in postmenopausal obese women.
