As infectious diseases continue to be one of the greatest health challenges 
worldwide, the demand toward alternative agents is continuously increasing. 
Recent advancement in nanotechnology has expanded our ability to design and 
construct nanomaterials to treat bacterial infections. Carbon nanotubes are one 
among these nanomaterials. Herein, we describe the covalent functionalization of 
the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with multiple molecules of 
ciprofloxacin. The prepared nanoantibiotics were characterized using different 
techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and 
thermogravimetric analysis. The characterization of the nanoantibiotics 
confirmed the successful covalent functionalization of the SWCNTs with 55% of 
functionalization as has been observed by thermogravimetric analysis. The 
release profile revealed that 90% of the loaded ciprofloxacin was released 
within 2.5 h at pH 7.4 showing a first-order release profile with R2>0.99. 
Interestingly, the results of the antibacterial activity indicated that the 
functionalized SWCNTs have significant increase in the antibacterial activity 
against the three strains of bacteria - by 16-fold for Staphylococcus aureus and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and by 8-fold for Escherichia coli - in comparison to the 
ciprofloxacin free drug. Moreover, the synthesized nanoantibiotic showed high 
hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility over a wide concentration range.
