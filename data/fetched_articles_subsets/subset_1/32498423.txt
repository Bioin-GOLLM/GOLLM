There are more than one million patients worldwide suffering paralysis caused by 
spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI causes severe socioeconomic problems not only to 
the patients and their caregivers but also to society; therefore, the 
development of innovative treatments is crucial. Many pharmacological therapies 
have been attempted in an effort to reduce SCI-related damage; however, no 
single therapy that could dramatically improve the serious long-term sequelae of 
SCI has emerged. Stem cell transplantation therapy, which can ameliorate damage 
or regenerate neurological networks, has been proposed as a promising candidate 
for SCI treatment, and many basic and clinical experiments using stem cells for 
SCI treatment have been launched, with promising results. However, the cell 
transplantation methods, including cell type, dose, transplantation route, and 
transplantation timing, vary widely between trials, and there is no consensus 
regarding the most effective treatment strategy. This study reviews the current 
knowledge on this issue, with a special focus on the clinical trials that have 
used stem cells for treating SCI, and highlights the problems that remain to be 
solved before the widespread clinical use of stem cells can be adopted.
