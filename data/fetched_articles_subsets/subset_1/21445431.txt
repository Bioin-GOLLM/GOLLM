Reactive oxygen species attack both base and sugar moieties in DNA with a 
preference among the bases for reaction at guanine. In the present study, 
2'-deoxyguanosine (dG) was oxidized by a copper-mediated Fenton reaction with 
the reductants ascorbate or N-acetyl-cysteine, yielding oxidation on both the 
base and the sugar. The primary oxidized lesions observed in these studies 
include the 2'-deoxyribonucleosides of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (dOG), 
spiroiminodihydantoin (dSp), guanidinohydantoin (dGh), oxazolone (dZ), and 
5-carboxamido-5-formamido-2-iminohydantoin (d2Ih), as well as the free base 
guanine. d2Ih was the major product observed in the nucleoside, single- and 
double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide contexts and is proposed to arise from 
oxidation at C5 of guanine. Product distribution studies provide insight into 
the role of the reductant in partitioning of dG base oxidation along the C5 and 
C8 pathways.
