Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are widespread types of protein 
machinery, typically consisting of a histidine kinase membrane sensor and a 
cytoplasmic transcriptional regulator that can sense and respond to 
environmental signals. TCSs are responsible for modulating genes involved in a 
multitude of bacterial functions, including cell division, motility, 
differentiation, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. 
Pathogenic bacteria exploit the capabilities of TCSs to reprogram gene 
expression according to the different niches they encounter during host 
infection. This review focuses on the role of TCSs in regulating the virulence 
phenotype of Shigella, an intracellular pathogen responsible for severe human 
enteric syndrome. The pathogenicity of Shigella is the result of the complex 
action of a wide number of virulence determinants located on the chromosome and 
on a large virulence plasmid. In particular, we will discuss how five TCSs, 
EnvZ/OmpR, CpxA/CpxR, ArcB/ArcA, PhoQ/PhoP, and EvgS/EvgA, contribute to linking 
environmental stimuli to the expression of genes related to virulence and 
fitness within the host. Considering the relevance of TCSs in the expression of 
virulence in pathogenic bacteria, the identification of drugs that inhibit TCS 
function may represent a promising approach to combat bacterial infections.
