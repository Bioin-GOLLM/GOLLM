BACKGROUND: There are no specific recommendations for the management of breast 
cancer patients with germ-line p53 mutations, an exceptional genetic condition, 
particularly regarding postoperative radiotherapy. Preclinical data suggested 
that p53 mutations conferred enhanced radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo and 
the few clinical observations showed that Li-Fraumeni families were at a higher 
risk of secondary radio-induced malignancies.
METHODS: We reviewed a cohort of patients with germ-line p53 mutations who had 
been treated for breast cancer as the first tumor event. We assessed their 
outcome and the incidence of secondary radio-induced malignancies.
RESULTS: Among 47 documented Li-Fraumeni families treated from 1997 to 2007 at 
the Institut Gustave Roussy, 8 patients had been diagnosed with breast cancer as 
the first tumor event. Three patients had undergone conservative breast surgery 
followed by postoperative radiotherapy and five patients had undergone a 
mastectomy (3 with postoperative radiotherapy). Thus, 6/8 patients had received 
postoperative radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 6 years. Median age at the 
diagnosis of the primary breast cancer was 30 years. The histological 
characteristics were as follows: intraductal carcinoma in situ (n = 3), invasive 
ductal carcinoma (n = 4) and a phyllodes tumor (n = 1). Among the 6 patients who 
had received adjuvant radiotherapy, the following events had occurred: 3 
ipsilateral breast recurrences, 3 contralateral breast cancers, 2 radio-induced 
cancers, and 3 new primaries (1 of which was an in-field thyroid cancer with 
atypical histology). In contrast, only one event had occurred (a contralateral 
breast cancer) among patients who had not received radiation therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations could argue in favor of bilateral mastectomy and 
the avoidance of radiotherapy.
