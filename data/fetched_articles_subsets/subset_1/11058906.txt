Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyses the O-methylation of 
neurotransmitters, catechol hormones and drugs such as levodopa and methyldopa. 
Ethnic differences in COMT activity have been observed in several populations. 
Previous studies suggest that the g1947G>A low activity allele is less common in 
individuals of African origin. COMT genotyping was performed using a 
mini-sequencing method in 195 healthy Ghanaians with a frequency of the 
homozygous g1947G>A of 6%. This study provides confirmation that the low 
activity COMT allele is less common in individuals of African origin. This 
finding may be important clinically with regards to the treatment of many 
neuropsychiatric disorders and in the pathophysiology of various human disorders 
including estrogen-induced cancers, Parkinson's disease, depression and 
hypertension.
