Senescent cells are generally characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest, 
metabolic alteration and activation, and apoptotic resistance in multiple organs 
due to various stressors. Excessive accumulation of senescent cells in numerous 
tissues leads to multiple chronic diseases, tissue dysfunction, age-related 
diseases and organ ageing. Immune cells can remove senescent cells. Immunaging 
or impaired innate and adaptive immune responses by senescent cells result in 
persistent accumulation of various senescent cells. Although senolytics-drugs 
that selectively remove senescent cells by inducing their apoptosis-are recent 
hot topics and are making significant research progress, senescence 
immunotherapies using immune cell-mediated clearance of senescent cells are 
emerging and promising strategies to fight ageing and multiple chronic diseases. 
This short review provides an overview of the research progress to date 
concerning senescent cell-caused chronic diseases and tissue ageing, as well as 
the regulation of senescence by small-molecule drugs in clinical trials and 
different roles and regulation of immune cells in the elimination of senescent 
cells. Mounting evidence indicates that immunotherapy targeting senescent cells 
combats ageing and chronic diseases and subsequently extends the healthy 
lifespan.
