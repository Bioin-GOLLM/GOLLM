PURPOSE: Docetaxel plus capecitabine, a commonly used chemotherapeutic regimen 
for metastatic breast cancer (MBC), is highly variable in its effectiveness. We 
aimed to investigate whether allelic variants of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
affected objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS) in MBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 79 SNPs in CYP450, whose minor allele frequency were ≥ 
10%, were genotyped in 69 MBC patients who were treated with docetaxel plus 
capecitabine. Pearson's χ(2) test or Fisher's exact test was used to investigate 
the influence of SNPs on objective response as appropriate. Log-rank test was 
used to assess the association between SNPs and survival outcomes.
RESULTS: There is no significant association between polymorphisms and both 
objective response and OS. Only one SNP, CYP1A1 rs1048943 A>G (Ile462Val), was 
significantly associated with PFS (P = 0.0003). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
its prognostic significance for PFS (P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: CYP1A1 rs1048943 A>G (Ile462Val) polymorphism is a potential 
prognostic marker for survival outcome after docetaxel plus capecitabine 
chemotherapy in MBC patients. However, confirmatory study is needed to validate 
this finding.
