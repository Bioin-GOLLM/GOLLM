The precise molecular mechanism of how misfolded α-synuclein (α-Syn) accumulates 
and spreads in synucleinopathies is still unknown. Here, we show the role of the 
cellular prion protein (PrPC) in mediating the uptake and the spread of 
recombinant α-Syn amyloids. The in vitro data revealed that the presence of PrPC 
fosters the higher uptake of α-Syn amyloid fibrils, which was also confirmed in 
vivo in wild type (Prnp +/+) compared to PrP knock-out (Prnp -/-) mice. 
Additionally, the presence of α-Syn amyloids blocked the replication of scrapie 
prions (PrPSc) in vitro and ex vivo, indicating a link between the two proteins. 
Indeed, whilst PrPC is mediating the internalization of α-Syn amyloids, PrPSc is 
not able to replicate in their presence. This observation has pathological 
relevance, since several reported case studies show that the accumulation of 
α-Syn amyloid deposits in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients is accompanied by a 
longer disease course.
