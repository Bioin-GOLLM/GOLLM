BACKGROUND: Papillary tumor of the pineal region (PTPR) represents a rare and 
histologically distinct subgroup of tumors originating in the pineal region. Few 
pediatric cases have been reported so far in the literature; therefore, clinical 
data are scarce.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of PTPR in a 9-year-old girl who presented 
with a 5-month history of excessive appetite and weight gain. The patient 
underwent neuroimaging procedures and total gross surgical resection with 
postoperative adjuvant local radiotherapy, which from our experience was the 
best treatment choice as an attempt to avoid local recurrence. During 78-month 
follow-up, the patient from our study manifested no disease recurrence.
CONCLUSION: PTPR should be included in the differential diagnosis of pineal 
region masses.
