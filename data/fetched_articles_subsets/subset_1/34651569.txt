The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) "Delta" is currently defined by PANGOLIN 
as a cluster of 33 different AY sublineages. Delta (in particular B.1.617.2) is 
largely and rapidly replacing the Alpha VOC as the dominant clade in most 
countries. To date, variations in the Spike protein of the Delta VOC have 
largely been limited. We report here the results of a genomic surveillance 
programme from Northern Italy. We identified several Delta sublineages 
harbouring mutations previously reported in GISAID at extremely low frequencies 
and in different combinations. Two patients (one of them vaccinated) tested 
positive for a Delta sublineage harbouring S71F, T250I, T572I and K854N. More 
patients tested positive for G769 V plus C1248F, A352S, and R158G and C1248F, 
respectively. Genomic surveillance of Delta variants should be encouraged to 
anticipate immune escape and deploy countermeasures.
