Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that 
regulates brain development and neurodegeneration. Cdk5 is activated by p25 that 
is generated from calpain-dependent cleavage of p35. The generation of p25 is 
responsible for the aberrant hyper-activation of Cdk5, which causes 
neurodegeneration. Using in vitro assays, we discovered that F-box/WD 
repeat-containing protein 7 (Fbxw7) is a new substrate of Cdk5. Additionally, 
Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of Fbxw7 was detected in the presence of p25, and 
two amino acid residues (S349 and S372) were determined to be major 
phosphorylation sites. This phosphorylation was eventually linked to decreased 
stability of Fbxw7. Using a culture model of cortical neurons challenged with 
glutamate, we confirmed that decreased stability of Fbxw7 was indeed 
Cdk5-dependent. Furthermore, diminished levels of Fbxw7 led to increased levels 
of transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun), a known substrate of Fbxw7. Given that 
previous reports demonstrate that c-Jun plays a role in accelerating neuronal 
apoptosis in these pathological models, our data support the concepts of a 
molecular cascade in which Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Fbxw7 negatively 
regulates Fbxw7 expression, thereby contributing to neuronal cell death 
following glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.
