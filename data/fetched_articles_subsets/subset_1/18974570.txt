Long-term observations over a period of 22 years in an Indian family with 
primary dysferlinopathy are recorded, defining phenotypic variability. In the 
propositus, the dystrophy began distally in the tibialis anterior muscles, 
before involving the gastrocnemius. Transient painful calf hypertrophy, followed 
by calf wasting was observed. The proximal lower and upper limbs weakened after 
three to four years. The younger sibling presented with the proximo-distal 
phenotype. Both patients showed very high creatine kinase values early into the 
illness. Disease progression was slow. The younger sibling lost ambulation 14 
years after onset, while the elder one remains ambulatory 22 years into the 
illness. Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic features and absence of dysferlin. 
Monocyte western blotting confirmed absence of dysferlin. Genetic analysis 
detected a heterozygous mutation in Exon 54 [c.6124C>T] in the DYSF gene. This 
is the first family with a diagnosis of dysferlinopathy supported by genetic 
data, reported from India.
