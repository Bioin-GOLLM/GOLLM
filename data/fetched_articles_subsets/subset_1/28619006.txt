BACKGROUND: Cattle resistance to ticks is known to be under genetic control with 
a complex biological mechanism within and among breeds. Our aim was to identify 
genomic segments and tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
tick-resistance in Hereford and Braford cattle. The predictive performance of a 
very low-density tag SNP panel was estimated and compared with results obtained 
with a 50 K SNP dataset.
RESULTS: BayesB (π = 0.99) was initially applied in a genome-wide association 
study (GWAS) for this complex trait by using deregressed estimated breeding 
values for tick counts and 41,045 SNP genotypes from 3455 animals raised in 
southern Brazil. To estimate the combined effect of a genomic region that is 
potentially associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL), 2519 non-overlapping 
1-Mb windows that varied in SNP number were defined, with the top 48 windows 
including 914 SNPs and explaining more than 20% of the estimated genetic 
variance for tick resistance. Subsequently, the most informative SNPs were 
selected based on Bayesian parameters (model frequency and t-like statistics), 
linkage disequilibrium and minor allele frequency to propose a very low-density 
58-SNP panel. Some of these tag SNPs mapped close to or within genes and 
pseudogenes that are functionally related to tick resistance. Prediction ability 
of this SNP panel was investigated by cross-validation using K-means and random 
clustering and a BayesA model to predict direct genomic values. Accuracies from 
these cross-validations were 0.27 ± 0.09 and 0.30 ± 0.09 for the K-means and 
random clustering groups, respectively, compared to respective values of 
0.37 ± 0.08 and 0.43 ± 0.08 when using all 41,045 SNPs and BayesB with π = 0.99, 
or of 0.28 ± 0.07 and 0.40 ± 0.08 with π = 0.999.
CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian GWAS model parameters can be used to select tag SNPs for a 
very low-density panel, which will include SNPs that are potentially linked to 
functional genes. It can be useful for cost-effective genomic selection tools, 
when one or a few key complex traits are of interest.
