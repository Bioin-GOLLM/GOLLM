To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the inherited 
predisposition to breast cancer in non-Ashkenazi Jews, we genotyped 54 Jewish 
Moroccan women with breast cancer, unselected for family history of cancer, for 
the predominant Jewish mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM. One patient (2%) was 
found to have the 185de1AG BRCA1 mutation, none was a carrier of the 6174delT 
BRCA2 mutation, and 2/54 (4%) were heterozygous for the ATM mutation. These 
rates were not significantly different from the rates in the general 
non-Ashkenazi population. These preliminary data may indicate that the 
predominant Jewish mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM genes contribute little, 
if any, to breast cancer predisposition and risk among Moroccan Jews.
