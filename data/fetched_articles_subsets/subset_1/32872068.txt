RATIONAL: Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency (THD) is a rare cause of 
dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). Although the symptoms of DRD may be improved by 
treatment with L-dopa, the low morbidity of THD can lead to its misdiagnosis. 
Thus, it is important for physicians to be aware of THD as a cause of DRD.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We report 3 cases of THD. A 5-year-old boy with DRD was 
diagnosed with THD and found to have compound heterozygous mutations of the TH 
gene, including TH:c.647G>C from his mother and TH:c.646G>A from his father. Two 
female siblings also were found to have TH:c.698G>A from their mother and 
TH:c.710T>C from their father. The younger daughter, at age 3.5 years, was 
diagnosed with DRD caused by THD, and then the diagnosis of the older daughter, 
at age 11 years, was changed from cerebral palsy to DRD caused by THD.
DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of dopa-responsive dystonia caused by tyrosine 
hydroxylase deficiency was determined by whole exome sequencing.
INTERVENTION: They all treated with low dose levodopa and benserazide tablets.
OUTCOMES: The boy had a very good therapeutic effect, and he could walk very 
well by the second day of treatment. The younger sister of the siblings had a 
partial therapeutic effect, but her elder sister was only little effective with 
a milder improvement of dystonia and improvement of myodynamia.
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of THD are heterogeneous, and its phenotypes are 
classified as type A or type B according to increasing severity. Generally, 
L-dopa has a good therapeutic effect in cases with type A phenotypes. We 
reviewed 87 cases of reported in the literature and found that c.698G>A and 
c.707T>C are hot spot mutations. Changes on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging 
were nonspecific. Analysis of neurotransmitter levels in cerebrospinal fluid is 
an invasive means of achieving a biochemical diagnosis.
