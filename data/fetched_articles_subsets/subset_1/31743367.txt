Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted pathogen in 
the United States, causing 99% of cervical cancers and 5% of all human cancers 
worldwide. HPV infection requires transport of the viral genome (vDNA) into the 
nucleus of basal keratinocytes. During this process, minor capsid protein L2 
facilitates subcellular retrograde trafficking of the vDNA from endosomes to the 
Golgi, and accumulation at host chromosomes during mitosis for nuclear retention 
and localization during interphase. Here we investigated the relationship 
between cellular glutathione (GSH) and HPV16 infection. siRNA knockdown of GSH 
biosynthetic enzymes results in a partial decrease of HPV16 infection. Likewise, 
infection of HPV16 in GSH depleted keratinocytes is inefficient, an effect that 
was not seen with adenoviral vectors. Analysis of trafficking revealed no 
defects in cellular binding, entry, furin cleavage of L2, or retrograde 
trafficking of HPV16, but GSH depletion hindered post-Golgi trafficking and 
translocation, decreasing nuclear accumulation of vDNA. Although precise 
mechanisms have yet to be defined, this work suggests that GSH is required for a 
specific post-Golgi trafficking step in HPV16 infection.
