Keratoconus (KTCN) is a degenerative disorder of the eye characterized by the 
conical shape and thinning of the cornea. The abnormal structure of 
KTCN-affected cornea results in loss of visual acuity. While many studies 
examine how environmental factors influence disease development, finding the 
genetic triggers has been a major emphasis of KTCN research. This paper focuses 
on genomic strategies that were implemented for finding candidate genes, 
including linkage and association studies, and presents different approaches of 
mutation screening. The advantages and limitations of particular tools are 
discussed based on literature and personal experience. Since etiology underlying 
KTCN is complex, numerous findings indicating heterogeneity of genetic factors 
involved KTCN etiology are presented.
