Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) are large self-assembling GTPases whose common 
function is to regulate membrane dynamics in a variety of cellular processes. 
Dnm1, which is a yeast DRP (Drp1/Dlp1 in humans), is required for mitochondrial 
division, but its mechanism is unknown. We provide evidence that Dnm1 likely 
functions through self-assembly to drive the membrane constriction event that is 
associated with mitochondrial division. Two regulatory features of Dnm1 
self-assembly were also identified. Dnm1 self-assembly proceeded through a 
rate-limiting nucleation step, and nucleotide hydrolysis by assembled Dnm1 
structures was highly cooperative with respect to GTP. Dnm1 formed extended 
spirals, which possessed diameters greater than those of dynamin-1 spirals but 
whose sizes, remarkably, were equal to those of mitochondrial constriction sites 
in vivo. These data suggest that Dnm1 has evolved to form structures that fit 
the dimensions of mitochondria.
