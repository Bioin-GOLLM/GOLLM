A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of the HLA-C gene is 
associated with HLA-C expression, and the high expressing genotype (CC) has been 
associated with HIV-I control. HLA-C is unique among the classical MHC class I 
molecules for its role in the control of viral infections and recognition of 
abnormal or missing self. This immunosurveillance is central to the pathogenesis 
of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 
particular. While sun exposure is a major risk factor for these cancers, 
cutaneous infections with genus β-HPV have been implicated in the development of 
SCC. We hypothesized that the high expression HLA-C genotype is associated with 
β-HPV infections. Therefore, we investigated the association between β-HPV 
serology and the -35 kb SNP (rs9264942) in a population-based case-control study 
of 510 SCC cases and 608 controls. Among controls, the high expression -35 kb 
SNP genotype (CC) reduced the likelihood of positive serology for multiple (≥2) 
β-HPV infections (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.97), and β-HPV species 2 infection 
(OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.23-0.79). However, no association with β-HPV status was 
observed among SCC cases. Our findings suggest that underlying immunogenotype 
plays an important role in differential control of β-HPV in SCC cases and 
controls.
