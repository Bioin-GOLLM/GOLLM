Combined deficiency of factors V and VIII is an autosomal recessive bleeding 
disorder resulting from alterations in an unknown gene on chromosome 18q, 
distinct from the factor V and factor VIII genes. ERGIC-53, a component of the 
ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, was mapped to a YAC and BAC contig containing 
the critical region for the combined factors V and VIII deficiency gene. DNA 
sequence analysis identified two different mutations, accounting for all 
affected individuals in nine families studied. Immunofluorescence and Western 
analysis of immortalized lymphocytes from patients homozygous for either of the 
two mutations demonstrate complete lack of expression of the mutated gene in 
these cells. These findings suggest that ERGIC-53 may function as a molecular 
chaperone for the transport from ER to Golgi of a specific subset of secreted 
proteins, including coagulation factors V and VIII.
