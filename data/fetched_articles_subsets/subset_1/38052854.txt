CAR-T therapy is a promising, novel treatment modality for B-cell malignancies 
and yet many patients relapse through a variety of means, including loss of 
CAR-T cells and antigen escape. To investigate leukemia-intrinsic CAR-T 
resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function 
screens in an immunocompetent murine model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (B-ALL) utilizing a modular guide RNA library. We identified 
IFNγR/JAK/STAT signaling and components of antigen processing and presentation 
pathway as key mediators of resistance to CAR-T therapy in vivo; intriguingly, 
loss of this pathway yielded the opposite effect in vitro (sensitized leukemia 
to CAR-T cells). Transcriptional characterization of this model demonstrated 
upregulation of these pathways in tumors relapsed after CAR-T treatment, and 
functional studies showed a surprising role for natural killer (NK) cells in 
engaging this resistance program. Finally, examination of data from B-ALL 
patients treated with CAR-T revealed an association between poor outcomes and 
increased expression of JAK/STAT and MHC-I in leukemia cells. Overall, our data 
identify an unexpected mechanism of resistance to CAR-T therapy in which tumor 
cell interaction with the in vivo tumor microenvironment, including NK cells, 
induces expression of an adaptive, therapy-induced, T-cell resistance program in 
tumor cells.
