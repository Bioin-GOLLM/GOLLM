The resurgence of research into cancer metabolism has recently broadened 
interests beyond glucose and the Warburg effect to other nutrients, including 
glutamine. Because oncogenic alterations of metabolism render cancer cells 
addicted to nutrients, pathways involved in glycolysis or glutaminolysis could 
be exploited for therapeutic purposes. In this Review, we provide an updated 
overview of glutamine metabolism and its involvement in tumorigenesis in vitro 
and in vivo, and explore the recent potential applications of basic science 
discoveries in the clinical setting.
