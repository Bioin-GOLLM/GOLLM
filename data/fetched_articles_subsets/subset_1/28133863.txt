OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify genetic causes of early onset epileptic 
encephalopathies with burst suppression (Ohtahara syndrome and early myoclonic 
encephalopathy) and evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations.
METHODS: We enrolled 33 patients with a referral diagnosis of Ohtahara syndrome 
or early myoclonic encephalopathy without malformations of cortical development. 
We performed detailed phenotypic assessment including seizure presentation, 
electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. We confirmed burst 
suppression in 28 of 33 patients. Research-based exome sequencing was performed 
for patients without a previously identified molecular diagnosis from clinical 
evaluation or a research-based epilepsy gene panel.
RESULTS: In 17 of 28 (61%) patients with confirmed early burst suppression, we 
identified variants predicted to be pathogenic in KCNQ2 (n = 10), STXBP1 
(n = 2), SCN2A (n = 2), PNPO (n = 1), PIGA (n = 1), and SEPSECS (n = 1). In 3 of 
5 (60%) patients without confirmed early burst suppression, we identified 
variants predicted to be pathogenic in STXBP1 (n = 2) and SCN2A (n = 1). The 
patient with the homozygous PNPO variant had a low cerebrospinal fluid 
pyridoxal-5-phosphate level. Otherwise, no early laboratory or clinical features 
distinguished the cases associated with pathogenic variants in specific genes 
from each other or from those with no prior genetic cause identified.
INTERPRETATION: We characterize the genetic landscape of epileptic 
encephalopathy with burst suppression, without brain malformations, and 
demonstrate feasibility of genetic diagnosis with clinically available testing 
in >60% of our cohort, with KCNQ2 implicated in one-third. This electroclinical 
syndrome is associated with pathogenic variation in SEPSECS. Ann Neurol
