Since the establishment of site-specific mutagenesis of single amino acids to 
interrogate protein function in the 1970s, biochemists have sought to tailor 
protein structure in the native cell environment. Fine-tuning the chemical 
properties of proteins is an indispensable way to address fundamental 
mechanistic questions. Unnatural amino acids (UAAs) offer the possibility to 
expand beyond the 20 naturally occurring amino acids in most species and install 
new and useful chemical functions. Here, we review the literature about advances 
in UAA incorporation technology from chemoenzymatic aminoacylation of modified 
tRNAs to in vitro translation systems to genetic encoding of UAAs in the native 
cell environment and whole organisms. We discuss innovative applications of the 
UAA technology to challenges in bioengineering and medicine.
