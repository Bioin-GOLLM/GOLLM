BACKGROUND: Technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how people with 
diabetes mellitus experience stress.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between stress 
and sequelae of diabetes mellitus within a unique data set composed of adults 
enrolled in a digital diabetes management program, Livongo, in order to inform 
intervention and product development.
METHODS: Participants included 3263 adults under age 65 who were diagnosed with 
diabetes mellitus and had access to Livongo through their employer between June 
2015 and August 2018. Data were collected at time of enrollment and 12 months 
thereafter, which included demographic information, glycemic control, presence 
of stress, diabetes distress, diabetes empowerment, behavioral health diagnosis, 
and utilization of behavioral health-related medication and services. Analysis 
of variance and chi-square tests compared variables across groups that were 
based on presence of stress and behavioral health diagnosis or utilization.
RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of participants (1808/3263) reported stress at the 
time of at least 1 blood glucose reading. Fifty-two percent of participants 
(940/1808) also received at least 1 behavioral health diagnosis or intervention. 
Compared to their peers, participants with stress reported greater diabetes 
distress, lower diabetes empowerment, greater insulin use, and poorer glycemic 
control. Participants with stress and a behavioral health diagnosis/utilization 
additionally had higher body mass index and duration of illness.
CONCLUSIONS: Stress among people with diabetes mellitus is associated with 
reduced emotional and physical health. Digital products that focus on the whole 
person by offering both diabetes mellitus self-management tools and behavioral 
health skills and support can help improve disease-specific and psychosocial 
outcomes.
