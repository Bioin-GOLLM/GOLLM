Accumulating evidence has revealed that mitochondria dynamics and function 
regulation is essential for the successful mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
differentiation. In the present study, the researchers reported for the first 
time that Mtu1 defects are correlated with reduced osteogenic differentiation. 
Using in vitro cultured bone marrow MSCs and stromal cell line MS5, we 
demonstrated that depressed Mtu1 expression was associated with reduced 
2-thiouridine modification of the U34 of mitochondrial tRNAGln, tRNAGlu, and 
tRNALys, which led to respiratory deficiencies and reduced mitochondrial ATP 
production, and finally suppressed osteogenic differentiation. As expected, 
these Mtu1-deficient mice exhibited obvious osteopenia. Therefore, our findings 
in this study provide new insights into the pathophysiology of osteopenia.
