BACKGROUND: Legionella pneumophila is the causative agent of human Legionnaire's 
disease. During infection, the bacterium invades macrophages and lung epithelial 
cells, and replicates intracellularly. However, little is known about its 
interaction with T cells. We investigated the ability of L. pneumophila to 
infect and stimulate the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in T cells. The 
objective of this study was to assess whether L. pneumophila interferes with the 
immune system by interacting and infecting T cells.
RESULTS: Wild-type L. pneumophila and flagellin-deficient Legionella, but not L. 
pneumophila lacking a functional type IV secretion system Dot/Icm, replicated in 
T cells. On the other hand, wild-type L. pneumophila and Dot/Icm-deficient 
Legionella, but not flagellin-deficient Legionella or heat-killed Legionella 
induced IL-8 expression. L. pneumophila activated an IL-8 promoter through the 
NF-kappaB and AP-1 binding regions. Wild-type L. pneumophila but not 
flagellin-deficient Legionella activated NF-kappaB, p38 mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and transforming growth 
factor beta-associated kinase 1 (TAK1). Transfection of dominant negative 
mutants of IkappaBalpha, IkappaB kinase, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, TAK1, MyD88, 
and p38 MAPK inhibited L. pneumophila-induced IL-8 activation. Inhibitors of 
NF-kappaB, p38 MAPK, and JNK blocked L. pneumophila-induced IL-8 expression. In 
addition, c-Jun, JunD, cyclic AMP response element binding protein, and 
activating transcription factor 1, which are substrates of p38 MAPK and JNK, 
bound to the AP-1 site of the IL-8 promoter.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, L. pneumophila induced a flagellin-dependent 
activation of TAK1, p38 MAPK, and JNK, as well as NF-kappaB and AP-1, which 
resulted in IL-8 production in human T cells, presumably contributing to the 
immune response in Legionnaire's disease.
