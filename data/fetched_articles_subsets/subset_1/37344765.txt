BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis and pathophysiology of idiopathic 
normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) remain unclear. Homocysteine may reduce the 
compliance of intracranial arteries and damage the endothelial function of the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may be the underlying mechanism of iNPH. The 
overlap cases between deep perforating arteriopathy (DPA) and iNPH were not rare 
for the shared risk factors. We aimed to investigate the relationship between 
serum homocysteine and iNPH in DPA.
METHODS: A total of 41 DPA patients with iNPH and 49 DPA patients without iNPH 
were included. Demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, laboratory 
results, and neuroimaging data were collected. Multivariable logistic regression 
analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between serum 
homocysteine and iNPH in DPA patients.
RESULTS: Patients with iNPH had significantly higher homocysteine levels than 
those without iNPH (median, 16.34 mmol/L versus 14.28 mmol/L; P = 0.002). There 
was no significant difference in CSVD burden scores between patients with iNPH 
and patients without iNPH. Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated 
that patients with homocysteine levels in the Tertile3 were more likely to have 
iNPH than those in the Tertile1 (OR, 4.929; 95% CI, 1.612-15.071; P = 0.005). 
The association remained significant after multivariable adjustment for 
potential confounders, including age, male, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or hypercholesterolemia, and eGFR 
level.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that high serum homocysteine levels were 
independently associated with iNPH in DPA. However, further research is needed 
to determine the predictive value of homocysteine and to confirm the underlying 
mechanism between homocysteine and iNPH.
