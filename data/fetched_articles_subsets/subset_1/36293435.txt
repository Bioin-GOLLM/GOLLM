Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer in the endocrine system. Most thyroid 
cancers have good prognosis, but some of them are resistant to treatment or show 
aggressive behavior. Like other tumors, thyroid cancers harbor tumor 
microenvironment (TME) composed of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and 
immune cells. Autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis can occur in the thyroid, and 
it may be associated with cancer development. TME is involved in tumor 
progression through various mechanisms: (1) CAF is involved in tumor progression 
through cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling; and (2) 
immune cells are involved in tumor progression through cell proliferation, 
angiogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and immune 
suppression. These events are activated by various cytokines, chemokines, and 
metabolites secreted from cells that comprise TME. This review is focused on how 
CAF and immune cells, two important cell components of thyroid cancer TME, are 
involved in tumor progression, and will explore their potential as therapeutic 
targets.
