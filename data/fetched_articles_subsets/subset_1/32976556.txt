The prevalence of obesity and the associated comorbidities highlight the 
importance of understanding the regulation of energy homeostasis. The central 
melanocortin system plays a critical role in controlling body weight balance. 
Melanocortin neurons sense and integrate the neuronal and hormonal signals, and 
then send regulatory projections, releasing anorexigenic or orexigenic 
melanocortin neuropeptides, to downstream neurons to regulate the food intake 
and energy expenditure. This review summarizes the latest progress in our 
understanding of the role of the melanocortin pathway in energy homeostasis. We 
also review the advances in the identification of human genetic variants that 
cause obesity via mechanisms that affect the central melanocortin system, which 
have provided rational targets for treatment of genetically susceptible 
patients.
