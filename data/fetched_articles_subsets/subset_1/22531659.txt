A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with visual loss, dysesthesia, 
gait disturbance, and urinary retention. A pacemaker was implanted 1 year ago 
for atrioventricular conduction block. Neurologic examination revealed mild 
cognitive impairment, near blindness with vitreous opacity, diffuse muscle 
weakness, loss of all sensory modalities with areflexia, and orthostatic 
hypotension. Head CT showed hydrocephalus. The Congo red staining of 
vitrectomized specimen and the biopsied sural nerve showed amyloid depositions. 
Gene analysis disclosed Val30Met missense mutation of transthyretin, which is 
responsible for familial amyloid polyneuropathy. His bed-ridden brother also had 
severe urinary dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension with hydrocephalus on 
MRI. These two sibling cases suggest correlation of the transthyretin Val30Met 
mutation with hydrocephalus, a rare phenotype of this disease.
