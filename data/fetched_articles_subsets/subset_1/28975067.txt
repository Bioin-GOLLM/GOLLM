While growing use of comprehensive mutational analysis has led to the discovery 
of innumerable genetic alterations associated with various myeloid neoplasms, 
the under-recognized phenomenon of genetic heterogeneity within such neoplasms 
creates a potential for diagnostic confusion. Here, we describe two cases where 
expanded mutational testing led to amendment of an initial diagnosis of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia with subsequent altered treatment of each patient. We 
demonstrate the power of comprehensive testing in ensuring appropriate 
classification of genetically heterogeneous neoplasms, and emphasize thoughtful 
analysis of molecular and genetic data as an essential component of diagnosis 
and management.
