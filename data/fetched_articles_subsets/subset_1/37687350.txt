Micronutrient iron (Fe) deficiency poses a widespread agricultural challenge 
with global implications. Fe deficiency affects plant growth and immune 
function, leading to reduced yields and contributing to the global "hidden 
hunger." While conventional Fe-based fertilizers are available, their efficacy 
is limited under certain conditions. Most recently, nanofertilizers have been 
shown as promising alternatives to conventional fertilizers. In this study, 
three nanohematite/nanoferrihydrite preparations (NHs) with different coatings 
were applied through the roots and shoots to Fe-deficient cucumber plants. To 
enhance Fe mobilization to leaves during foliar treatment, the plants were 
pre-treated with various acids (citric acid, ascorbic acid, and glycine) at a 
concentration of 0.5 mM. Multiple physiological parameters were examined, 
revealing that both root and foliar treatments resulted in improved chlorophyll 
content, biomass, photosynthetic parameters, and reduced ferric chelate 
reductase activity. The plants also significantly accumulated Fe in their 
developing leaves and its distribution after NHs treatment, detected by X-ray 
fluorescence mapping, implied long-distance mobilization in their veins. These 
findings suggest that the applied NHs effectively mitigated Fe deficiency in 
cucumber plants through both modes of application, highlighting their potential 
as nanofertilizers on a larger scale.
