PURPOSE: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely utilized as means to deliver mRNA 
molecules. However, metric connections between biodistribution and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of the nanoparticle carrier and transgene expression 
dynamics remain largely unknown.
METHODS: LNPs containing mRNAs encoding the firefly luciferase gene were 
prepared with varying sizes. Biodistributions of injected LNPs in mice were 
measured by fluorescence bioimaging or liquid chromatography with tandem mass 
spectrometry. In addition, luciferase expression levels were determined by 
bioluminescence imaging and enzyme activity assays.
RESULTS: Some intramuscularly injected LNPs were found circulating in the 
system, resulting in accumulation in the liver and spleen, especially when the 
LNP sizes were relatively small. Bigger LNPs were more likely to remain at the 
injection site. Transgene expression in the liver was found most prominent 
compared with other organs and tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomolecules such as mRNAs encapsulated in locally injected LNPs 
can reach other organs and tissues via systemic circulation. Gene expression 
levels are affected by the LNP biodistribution and pharmacokinetics (PK), which 
are further influenced by the particle size and injection route. As transfection 
efficiency varies in different organs, the LNP exposure and mRNA expression are 
not linearly correlated.
