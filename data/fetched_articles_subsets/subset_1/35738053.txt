BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease declared as a global pandemic 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Genomic changes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) 
region of SARS-CoV-2 led to an increased, infectivity in humans through 
interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor. 
Simultaneously, the genetic variants in ACE2 provide an opportunity for 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity. We demonstrate the binding efficiencies of 
RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 strain with ACE2 variants of the human host.
METHODOLOGY: A Total of 615 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were retrieved from repository. 
Eighteen variations were identified contributing to structural changes in RBD 
that are distributed in 615 isolates. An analyses of 285 single nucleotide 
variances at the coding region of the ACE2 receptor showed 34 to be pathogenic. 
Homology models of 34 ACE2 and 18 RBD structures were constructed with 34 and 18 
structural variants, respectively. Protein docking of 612 (34 *18) ACE2-RBD 
complexes showed variable affinities compared to wildtype Wuhan's and other 
SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, including Omicron B.1.1.529. Finally, molecular dynamic 
simulation was performed to determine the stability of the complexes.
RESULTS: Among 612, the top 3 complexes showing least binding energy were 
selected. The ACE2 with rs961360700 variant showed the least binding energy 
(-895.2 Kcal/mol) on binding with the RBD of Phe160Ser variant compared to 
Wuhan's RBD complex. Interestingly, the binding energy of RBD of Omicron 
B.1.1.529 with ACE2 (rs961360700) structure showed least binding energy of -1010 
Kcal/mol. Additionally, molecular dynamics showed structure stability for all 
the analysed complexes with the RMSD (0.22-0.26 nm), RMSF (0.11-0.13 nm), and Rg 
(2.53-2.56 nm).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our investigation highlights the clinical variants 
contributing to structural variants in ACE2 receptors that lead to efficient 
binding of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, screening of these ACE2 polymorphisms will 
help detect COVID-19 risk population so as to provide additional care and for 
safe management.
