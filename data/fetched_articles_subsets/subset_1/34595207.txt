Exosomes or other extracellular vesicles released from cells play an important 
role in cell-to-cell communication by transferring bio-information (DNA, 
coding/non-coding RNA, and proteins), which indicates parental cell status to 
recipient cells in the extracellular environment. Increasingly, evidence shows 
that tumor-derived exosomes mediate tumor pre-metastatic niche (PMN) remodeling 
to establish a supportive and receptive niche to promote tumor cell colonization 
and metastasis. Uptake of genetic information by target cells in the 
extracellular environment triggers epigenetic changes that contribute to PMN 
formation. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current 
understanding of exosomes-mediated reprogramming of cells in PMN formation.
