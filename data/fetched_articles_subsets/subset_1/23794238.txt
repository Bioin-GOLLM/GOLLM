OBJECTIVES: Genome wide association studies have shown 32 loci to influence BMI 
in European-American adults but replication in other studies is inconsistent and 
may be attributed to gene-by-age effects. The aims of this study were to 
determine if the influence of the summed risk score of these 32 loci (GRS) on 
BMI differed across age from birth to 40 years, and to determine if additive 
genetic effects other than those in the GRS differed by age.
METHODS: Serial measures of BMI were calculated at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 28 
months, and 4, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 30, and 40 years for 1,176 (605 females, 571 
males) European-American participants in the Fels Longitudinal Study. SOLAR was 
used for genetic analyses.
RESULTS: GRS was significant (P < 0.05) at ages: 6, 9 months, 4-15 years, and 
23-40 years. Remaining additive genetic effects independently influenced BMI (P 
< 5.3 × 10(-5) , 0.40 < h(2) < 0.76). Some genetic correlations between ages 
were not significant. Differential GRS effects did not retain significance after 
multiple comparisons adjustments.
CONCLUSIONS: While well-known BMI variants do not appear to have significant 
differential effects, other additive genes differ over the lifespan.
