We previously found that sulfur fumigation, a commonly used controversial method 
for the post-harvest handling of ginger, induces the generation of a compound in 
ginger, which was speculated to be a sulfur-containing derivative of 6-shogaol 
based on its mass data. However, the chemical and biological properties of the 
compound remain unknown. As a follow-up study, here we report the chemical 
structure, systemic exposure, and anticancer activity of the compound. 
Chromatographic separation, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, and chemical 
synthesis structurally elucidated the compound as 6-gingesulfonic acid. 
Pharmacokinetics in rats found that 6-gingesulfonic acid was more slowly 
absorbed and eliminated, with more prototypes existing in the blood than 
6-shogaol. Metabolism profiling indicated that the two compounds produced 
qualitatively and quantitatively different metabolites. It was further found 
that 6-gingesulfonic acid exerted significantly weaker antiproliferative 
activity on tumor cells than 6-shogaol. The data provide chemical and biological 
evidence that sulfur fumigation may impair the healthcare functions of ginger.
