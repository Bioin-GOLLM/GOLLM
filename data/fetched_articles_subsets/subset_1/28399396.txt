The induction of autophagy by nutrient deprivation leads to a rapid increase in 
the formation of autophagosomes, unique organelles that replenish the cellular 
pool of nutrients by sequestering cytoplasmic material for degradation. The 
urgent need for membranes to form autophagosomes during starvation to maintain 
homeostasis leads to a dramatic rearrangement of intracellular membranes. Here 
we discuss recent findings that have begun to uncover how different parts of the 
secretory pathway directly and indirectly contribute to autophagosome formation 
during starvation.
