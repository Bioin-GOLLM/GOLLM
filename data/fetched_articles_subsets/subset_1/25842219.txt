Influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics and also poses a high risk for 
pandemics. To develop a broadly cross-protective influenza vaccine we have 
previously shown that a formulation consisting of the extracellular domain of M2 
membrane protein (M2e) immobilized on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and soluble CpG 
as an adjuvant can elicit protective immunity against different influenza A 
subtypes. The vaccine formulation contains M2e that is immobilized on AuNPs, and 
an excess amount that is freely dissolved in solution, whose role in inducing 
protective immunity against virus infection is unclear. Using a mouse model, the 
current study shows that inclusion of excess soluble M2e antigen along with M2e 
immobilized on AuNPs is vital for inducing high levels of antibody response, and 
in providing complete protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. We 
also show that the vaccine induces long-lasting protection against mortality and 
morbidity upon lethal challenge with influenza A virus.
