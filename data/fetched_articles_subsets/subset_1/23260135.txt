The high level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) present in neuronal genomes 
suggests that mechanisms interpreting 5hmC in the CNS may differ from those 
present in embryonic stem cells. Here, we present quantitative, genome-wide 
analysis of 5hmC, 5-methylcytosine (5mC), and gene expression in differentiated 
CNS cell types in vivo. We report that 5hmC is enriched in active genes and 
that, surprisingly, strong depletion of 5mC is observed over these regions. The 
contribution of these epigenetic marks to gene expression depends critically on 
cell type. We identify methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as the major 
5hmC-binding protein in the brain and demonstrate that MeCP2 binds 5hmC- and 
5mC-containing DNA with similar high affinities. The Rett-syndrome-causing 
mutation R133C preferentially inhibits 5hmC binding. These findings support a 
model in which 5hmC and MeCP2 constitute a cell-specific epigenetic mechanism 
for regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression.
