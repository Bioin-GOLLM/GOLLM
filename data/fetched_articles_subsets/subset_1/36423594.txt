INTRODUCTION: High indoxyl sulfate (IS) concentration is a serious problem for 
patients with CKD increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and CKD 
progression. Thus, the methods of decreasing the toxin concentrations are highly 
desired. The study aimed to discover the role of selected intestine-related 
factors on IS concentration.
METHODS: We evaluated the impact of ABCG2 and ABCC2 polymorphisms influencing 
activity and protein intake by normalized protein catabolic rate. Additionally, 
we examined the relation of IS and uric acid (UA) that can share common 
elimination transporters. A monocentric, prospective, open cohort pilot study 
was performed on 108 patients undergoing dialysis treatment.
RESULTS: The positive effect of residual diuresis on the reduction of IS levels 
was confirmed (p = 0.005). Also, an increase in IS depending on the dietary 
protein intake was confirmed (p = 0.040). No significant correlation between ABC 
gene polymorphisms was observed either, suggesting the negligible role of ABCG2 
and ABCC2 in the elimination of IS in small bowel. The significant difference 
was observed for UA where ABCG2 421C>A (rs72552713) gene polymorphism was higher 
(505.3 μmol/L) in comparison with a wild-type genotype (360.5 μmol/L).
CONCLUSION: No evidence of bowel elimination pathway via ABCC2 and ABCG2 
transporters was found in renal replacement therapy patients.
