The delivery of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) to the fetus is dependent on maternal 
one-carbon metabolism, as the latter supports the hepatic synthesis and export 
of a DHA-enriched phosphatidylcholine molecule via the phosphatidylethanolamine 
N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway. The following is a post-hoc analysis of a 
choline intervention study that sought to investigate whether common variants in 
one-carbon metabolizing genes associate with maternal and/or fetal blood 
biomarkers of DHA status. Pregnant women entering their second trimester were 
randomized to consume, until delivery, either 25 (n = 15) or 550 (n = 15) mg 
choline/d, and the effects of genetic variants in the PEMT, BHMT, MTHFD1, and 
MTHFR genes on DHA status were examined. Variant (vs. non-variant) maternal PEMT 
rs4646343 genotypes tended to have lower maternal RBC DHA (% total fatty acids) 
throughout gestation (6.9% vs. 7.4%; main effect, p = 0.08) and lower cord RBC 
DHA at delivery (7.6% vs. 8.4%; main effect, p = 0.09). Conversely, variant (vs. 
non-variant) maternal MTHFD1 rs2235226 genotypes exhibited higher cord RBC DHA 
(8.3% vs. 7.3%; main effect, p = 0.0003) and higher cord plasma DHA (55 vs. 41 
μg/mL; main effect, p = 0.05). Genotype tended to interact with maternal choline 
intake (p < 0.1) to influence newborn DHA status for PEMT rs4646343 and PEMT 
rs7946. These data support the need to consider variants in one-carbon metabolic 
genes in studies assessing DHA status and requirements during pregnancy.
