Experimental and computational studies pinpoint rate-limiting step(s) in 
metastasis governed by Rac1. Using ovarian cancer cell and animal models, Rac1 
expression was manipulated, and quantitative measurements of cell-cell and 
cell-substrate adhesion, cell invasion, mesothelial clearance, and peritoneal 
tumor growth discriminated the tumor behaviors most highly influenced by Rac1. 
The experimental data were used to parameterize an agent-based computational 
model simulating peritoneal niche colonization, intravasation, and hematogenous 
metastasis to distant organs. Increased ovarian cancer cell survival afforded by 
the more rapid adhesion and intravasation upon Rac1 overexpression is predicted 
to increase the numbers of and the rates at which tumor cells are disseminated 
to distant sites. Surprisingly, crowding of cancer cells along the blood vessel 
was found to decrease the numbers of cells reaching a distant niche irrespective 
of Rac1 overexpression or knockdown, suggesting that sites for tumor cell 
intravasation are rate limiting and become accessible if cells intravasate 
rapidly or are displaced due to diminished viability. Modeling predictions were 
confirmed through animal studies of Rac1-dependent metastasis to the lung. 
Collectively, the experimental and modeling approaches identify cell adhesion, 
rapid intravasation, and survival in the blood as parameters in the ovarian 
metastatic cascade that are most critically dependent on Rac1.
