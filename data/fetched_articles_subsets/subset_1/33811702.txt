Hyperactivation of PARP1 is known to be a major cause of necrotic cell death by 
depleting NAD+ /ATP pools during Ca2+ overload which is associated with many 
ischemic diseases. However, little is known about how PARP1 hyperactivity is 
regulated during calcium overload. In this study we show that ATR kinase, well 
known for its role in DNA damage responses, suppresses ionomycin, glutamate, or 
quinolinic acid-induced necrotic death of cells including SH-SY5Y neuronal 
cells. We found that the inhibition of necrosis requires the kinase activity of 
ATR. Specifically, ATR binds to and phosphorylates PARP1 at Ser179 after the 
ionophore treatments. This site-specific phosphorylation inactivates PARP1, 
inhibiting ionophore-induced necrosis. Strikingly, all of this occurs in the 
absence of detectable DNA damage and signaling up to 8 hours after ionophore 
treatment. Furthermore, little AIF was released from mitochondria/cytoplasm for 
nuclear import, supporting the necrotic type of cell death in the early period 
of the treatments. Our results reveal a novel ATR-mediated anti-necrotic 
mechanism in the cellular stress response to calcium influx without DNA damage 
signaling.
