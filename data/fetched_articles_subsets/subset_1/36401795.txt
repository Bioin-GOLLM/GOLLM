Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and 
functions as a tumour suppressor in different cancer models. In the present 
study, we report detailed characterization of 
11-chloro-7H-benzimidazo[2,1-a]benzo[de]iso-quinolin-7-one (11-Cl-BBQ) as a 
select modulator of AhR-regulated transcription (SMAhRT) with anti-cancer 
actions. Treatment of lung cancer cells with 11-Cl-BBQ induced potent and 
sustained AhR-dependent anti-proliferative effects by promoting G1 phase cell 
cycle arrest. Investigation of 11-Cl-BBQ-induced transcription in H460 cells 
with or without the AhR expression by RNA-sequencing revealed activation of p53 
signalling. In addition, 11-Cl-BBQ suppressed multiple pathways involved in DNA 
replication and increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, 
including p27Kip1 , in an AhR-dependent manner. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of 
individual genes revealed the requirement for both p53 and p27Kip1 for the 
AhR-mediated anti-proliferative effects. Our results identify 11-Cl-BBQ as a 
potential lung cancer therapeutic, highlight the feasibility of targeting AhR 
and provide important mechanistic insights into AhR-mediated-anticancer actions.
