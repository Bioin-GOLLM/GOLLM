Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of hypervascular tumor, and 
angiogenesis is important for HCC tumor growth. Eph receptor B1 (EPHB1), a 
member of the Eph family, mediates embryonic vascular system development and 
adult angiogenesis. This receptor may be involved in carcinogenesis of the 
digestive tract. Our aim was to examine the relationships between EPHB1 
polymorphisms and HCC in the Korean population. Genomic DNA was extracted from 
182 patients with HCC and 266 healthy subjects. EPHB1 polymorphisms were 
determined by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Multiple logistic 
regression models (log-additive, dominant, and recessive models) were used for 
odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values. Five polymorphisms 
(rs11929692, rs7644369, rs6776570, rs3821502, and rs6766459) of the EPHB1 gene 
and alleles of 2 polymorphisms (rs1502174 and rs9877457) were associated with 
HCC (p < 0.05 for both). Our results suggest that EPHB1 polymorphisms may be 
associated with susceptibility to HCC in the Korean population.
