The remarkable regeneration capability of skeletal muscle depends on the 
coordinated proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells (SCs). The 
self-renewal of SCs is critical for long-term maintenance of muscle regeneration 
potential. Hypoxia profoundly affects the proliferation, differentiation, and 
self-renewal of cultured myoblasts. However, the physiological relevance of 
hypoxia and hypoxia signaling in SCs in vivo remains largely unknown. Here, we 
demonstrate that SCs are in an intrinsic hypoxic state in vivo and express 
hypoxia-inducible factor 2A (HIF2A). HIF2A promotes the stemness and long-term 
homeostatic maintenance of SCs by maintaining their quiescence, increasing their 
self-renewal, and blocking their myogenic differentiation. HIF2A stabilization 
in SCs cultured under normoxia augments their engraftment potential in 
regenerative muscle. Conversely, HIF2A ablation leads to the depletion of SCs 
and their consequent regenerative failure in the long-term. In contrast, 
transient pharmacological inhibition of HIF2A accelerates muscle regeneration by 
increasing SC proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, HIF2A induces 
the quiescence and self-renewal of SCs by binding the promoter of the Spry1 gene 
and activating Spry1 expression. These findings suggest that HIF2A is a pivotal 
mediator of hypoxia signaling in SCs and may be therapeutically targeted to 
improve muscle regeneration.
