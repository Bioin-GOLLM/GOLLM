Protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) enzymes play a crucial role in RNA 
splicing, DNA damage repair, cell signaling, and differentiation. Arginine 
methylation is a prominent posttransitional modification of histones and various 
non-histone proteins that can either activate or repress gene expression. The 
aberrant expression of PRMTs has been linked to multiple abnormalities, notably 
cancer. Herein, we review a number of non-histone protein substrates for all 
nine members of human PRMTs and how PRMT-mediated non-histone arginine 
methylation modulates various diseases. Additionally, we highlight the most 
recent clinical studies for several PRMT inhibitors.
