BACKGROUND: Increased nociceptive neuronal excitability underlies chronic pain 
conditions. Various ion channels, including sodium, calcium and potassium 
channels have pivotal roles in the control of neuronal excitability. The members 
of the family of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, 
GIRK1-4, have been implicated in modulating excitability. Here, we investigated 
the expression and distribution of GIRK1 and GIRK2 in normal and injured dorsal 
root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord of rats.
RESULTS: We found that ~70% of the DRG neurons expressed GIRK1, while only <10% 
expressed GIRK2. The neurochemical profiles of GIRK1- and GIRK2-immunoreactive 
neurons were characterized using the neuronal markers calcitonin gene-related 
peptide, isolectin-B4 and neurofilament-200, and the calcium-binding proteins 
calbindin D28k, calretinin, parvalbumin and secretagogin. Both GIRK subunits 
were expressed in DRG neurons with nociceptive characteristics. However, while 
GIRK1 was widely expressed in several sensory neuronal subtypes, GIRK2 was 
detected mainly in a group of small C-fiber neurons. In the spinal dorsal horn, 
GIRK1- and -2-positive cell bodies and processes were mainly observed in lamina 
II, but also in superficial and deeper layers. Abundant GIRK1-, but not 
GIRK2-like immunoreactivity, was found in the ventral horn (laminae VI-X). 
Fourteen days after axotomy, GIRK1 and GIRK2 were down-regulated in DRG neurons 
at the mRNA and protein levels. Both after axotomy and rhizotomy there was a 
reduction of GIRK1- and -2-positive processes in the dorsal horn, suggesting a 
presynaptic localization of these potassium channels. Furthermore, nerve 
ligation caused accumulation of both subunits on both sides of the lesion, 
providing evidence for anterograde and retrograde fast axonal transport.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that reduced GIRK function is 
associated with increased neuronal excitability and causes sensory disturbances 
in post-injury conditions, including neuropathic pain.
