The structure of the natural product lawinal [systematic name: 
(-)-(2S)-5,7-dihy-droxy-6-methyl-4-oxo-2-phenyl-chromane-8-carbaldehyde, 
C17H14O5] at 150 K is reported. The compound crystallizes with monoclinic (I2) 
symmetry and with Z' = 2. The absolute configuration could not be determined 
reliably from X-ray analysis only. However, our analysis returns the 
S-configuration at the C-2 position, consistent with previous stereochemical 
assignment from specific rotation. The independent mol-ecules form into 
alternating hydrogen-bonded chains with C-H⋯O=CH inter-molecular linkages that 
run parallel to the crystallographic a axis and are extended into the ac plane 
by π-π inter-actions between their phenyl substituents.
