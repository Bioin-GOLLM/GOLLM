As the predominant thyroid cancer, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounts for 
75‑85% of thyroid cancer cases. This research aimed to investigate 
transcriptomic changes and key genes in PTC. Using RNA‑sequencing technology, 
the transcriptional profiles of 5 thyroid tumor tissues and 5 adjacent normal 
tissues were obtained. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 
identified by SAMtools software and then annotated by ANNOVAR software. After 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected by edgR software, they were 
further investigated by enrichment analysis, protein domain analysis, and 
protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Additionally, the potential 
gene fusion events were predicted using FusionMap software. A total of 70,172 
SNPs and 2,686 DEGs in the tumor tissues, as well as 83,869 SNPs in the normal 
tissues were identified. In the PPI network, fibronectin 1 (FN1; degree=31) and 
transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (TGFβR1; degree=22) had higher degrees. 
A total of 7 PPI pairs containing the non‑synonymous risk SNP loci in the 
interaction domains were identified. Particularly, the interaction domains 
involved in the interactions of FN1 and 5 other proteins (such as FN1‑tenascin 
C, TNC) had non‑synonymous risk SNP loci. Furthermore, 11 and 4 gene fusion 
events were identified in all of the tumor tissues and normal tissues, 
respectively. Additionally, the NK2 homeobox 1‑surfactant associated 3 
(NKX2‑1‑SFTA3) gene fusion was identified in both tumor and normal tissues. 
These results indicated that TGFβR1 and the NKX2‑1‑SFTA3 gene fusion may be 
involved in PTC. Furthermore, FN1 and TNC containing the non‑synonymous risk SNP 
loci might serve a role in PTC by interacting with each other.
