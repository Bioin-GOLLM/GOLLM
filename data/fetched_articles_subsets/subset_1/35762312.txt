Connexins (Cxs) play key roles in cellular communication. By facilitating 
metabolite exchange or interfering with distinct signaling pathways, Cxs affect 
cell homeostasis, proliferation, and differentiation. Variations in the activity 
and expression of Cxs have been linked to numerous clinical conditions including 
carcinomas, cardiac disorders, and wound healing. Recent discoveries on the 
association between Cxs and angiogenesis have sparked interest in Cx‑mediated 
angiogenesis due to its essential functions in tissue formation, wound repair, 
tumor growth, and metastasis. It is now widely recognized that understanding the 
association between Cxs and angiogenesis may aid in the development of new 
targeted therapies for angiogenic diseases. The aim of the present review was to 
provide a comprehensive overview of Cxs and Cx‑mediated angiogenesis, with a 
focus on therapeutic implications.
