The photochemical regulation of biological systems represents a very precise 
means of achieving high-resolution control over gene expression in both a 
spatial and a temporal fashion. DNAzymes are enzymatically active 
deoxyoligonucleotides that enable the site-specific cleavage of RNA and have 
been used in a variety of in vitro applications. We have previously reported the 
photochemical activation of DNAzymes and antisense agents through the 
preparation of a caged DNA phosphoramidite and its site-specific incorporation 
into oligonucleotides. The presence of the caging group disrupts either DNA:RNA 
hybridization or catalytic activity until removed via a brief irradiation with 
UV light. Here, we are expanding this concept by investigating the photochemical 
deactivation of DNAzymes and antisense agents. Moreover, we report the 
application of light-activated and light-deactivated antisense agents to the 
regulation of gene function in mammalian cells. This represents the first 
example of gene silencing antisense agents that can be turned on and turned off 
in mammalian tissue culture.
