OBJECTIVES: The Xq28 region, containing IRAK and MECP2, represent a common 
susceptibility locus for a high number of autoimmune diseases. Our aim in the 
present study was to evaluate the influence of the IRAK1 and MECP2 
autoimmunity-associated genetic variants in the giant cell arteritis (GCA) 
susceptibility and its clinical subphenotypes.
METHODS: We analysed a total of 627 female biopsy-proven GCA patients and 1,520 
female healthy controls of Spanish Caucasian origin. Two polymorphisms, 
rs1059702 and rs17345, located at IRAK1 and MECP2, respectively, were genotyped 
using TaqMan® allelic discrimination assays.
RESULTS: No association with any of the analysed polymorphisms was evident when 
genotype and allele frequencies were compared between GCA patients and controls 
(rs1059702: allelic p-value=0.699, OR=0.96, CI 95% 0.80-1.17; rs17435: allelic 
p-value=0.994, OR=1.00, CI 95% 0.84-1.19). Likewise, the subphenotype analysis 
yield similar negative results.
CONCLUSIONS: We have assessed for the first time the possible role of IRAK1 and 
MECP2 autoimmune disease-associated polymorphisms in GCA. Our data suggest that 
IRAK1 rs1059702 and MECP2 rs17435 genetic variants do not play a significant 
role in GCA susceptibility or severity.
