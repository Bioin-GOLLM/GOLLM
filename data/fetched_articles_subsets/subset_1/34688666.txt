The salivary glands of the flea Xenopsylla cheopis, a vector of the plague 
bacterium, Yersinia pestis, express proteins and peptides thought to target the 
hemostatic and inflammatory systems of its mammalian hosts. Past transcriptomic 
analyses of salivary gland tissue revealed the presence of two similar peptides 
(XC-42 and XC-43) having no extensive similarities to any other deposited 
sequences. Here we show that these peptides specifically inhibit coagulation of 
plasma and the amidolytic activity of α-thrombin. XC-43, the smaller of the two 
peptides, is a fast, tight-binding inhibitor of thrombin with a dissociation 
constant of less than 10 pM. XC-42 exhibits similar selectivity as well as 
kinetic and binding properties. The crystal structure of XC-43 in complex with 
thrombin shows that despite its substrate-like binding mode, XC-43 is not 
detectably cleaved by thrombin and that it interacts with the thrombin surface 
from the enzyme catalytic site through the fibrinogen-binding exosite I. The low 
rate of hydrolysis was verified in solution experiments with XC-43, which show 
the substrate to be largely intact after 2 h of incubation with thrombin at 37 
°C. The low rate of XC-43 cleavage by thrombin may be attributable to specific 
changes in the catalytic triad observable in the crystal structure of the 
complex or to extensive interactions in the prime sites that may stabilize the 
binding of cleavage products. Based on the increased arterial occlusion time, 
tail bleeding time, and blood coagulation parameters in rat models of thrombosis 
XC-43 could be valuable as an anticoagulant.
