Much of our current understanding of how small-molecule ligands interact with 
proteins stems from X-ray crystal structures determined at cryogenic (cryo) 
temperature. For proteins alone, room-temperature (RT) crystallography can 
reveal previously hidden, biologically relevant alternate conformations. 
However, less is understood about how RT crystallography may impact the 
conformational landscapes of protein-ligand complexes. Previously, we showed 
that small-molecule fragments cluster in putative allosteric sites using a cryo 
crystallographic screen of the therapeutic target PTP1B (Keedy et al., 2018). 
Here, we have performed two RT crystallographic screens of PTP1B using many of 
the same fragments, representing the largest RT crystallographic screens of a 
diverse library of ligands to date, and enabling a direct interrogation of the 
effect of data collection temperature on protein-ligand interactions. We show 
that at RT, fewer ligands bind, and often more weakly - but with a variety of 
temperature-dependent differences, including unique binding poses, changes in 
solvation, new binding sites, and distinct protein allosteric conformational 
responses. Overall, this work suggests that the vast body of existing 
cryo-temperature protein-ligand structures may provide an incomplete picture, 
and highlights the potential of RT crystallography to help complete this picture 
by revealing distinct conformational modes of protein-ligand systems. Our 
results may inspire future use of RT crystallography to interrogate the roles of 
protein-ligand conformational ensembles in biological function.
