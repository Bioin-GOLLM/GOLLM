Vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor I (VIPRI) expression was examined in 
megakaryocytes using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
VIPRI protein was characterized in platelet membranes using covalent 
crosslinking techniques. Human megakaryocytes were isolated from suspension 
cultures of cord blood and adult bone marrow mononuclear cells using a murine 
monoclonal antibody to human platelet glycoprotein IIB/IIIA (CD41) and 
immunomagnetic beads. RT-PCR primers were constructed for the VIP, VIPRI, and 
VIPRII genes as well as for megakaryocyte specific genes, c-mpl and platelet 
factor 4 (PF-4). VIP, VIPRI, c-mpl, and PF-4 were coexpressed in megakaryocyte 
mRNA. Southern blot analysis confirmed the expression of VIPRI. 125I-VIP was 
covalently cross-linked to human platelet membranes using the homobifunctional 
reagent disuccinimidyl suberate, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
and autoradiography. A 125I-VIP-protein complex of Mr = 50,000 was identified. 
Labeling of the Mr = 50,000 component was completely abolished by unlabeled VIP, 
but not by peptide histidine methionine or growth hormone releasing factor, 
indicating specific binding of VIP to the platelet membranes. Taken together, 
these results suggest that VIP may have direct effects on megakaryocytopoiesis 
and support our earlier observations of VIP modulation of platelet aggregation.
