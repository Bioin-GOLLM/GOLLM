Ubiquitin thioester is a key intermediate in the ubiquitylation of proteins and 
is formed enzymatically through the activation of alpha-COOH of ubiquitin in an 
ATP dependent manner using the E1 enzyme. The current methods used for the 
preparation of ubiquitin thioester rely on either the enzymatic machinery or on 
expressed protein ligation technology. In this article, we report a new chemical 
strategy, combining native chemical ligation and N-methylcysteine containing 
peptides, to chemically prepare ubiquitin thioester for the first time. The 
N-methylcysteine is utilized as an N-->S acyl transfer device, and in its 
protected form serves as a latent thioester functionality. This enabled us to 
trigger the formation of ubiquitin thioester subsequent to the assembly of the 
ubiquitin polypeptide via native chemical ligation. The synthetic ubiquitin 
thioester showed a similar behavior in peptide ubiquitylation to the one 
obtained via expression. This approach should allow for higher flexibility in 
the chemical manipulation of ubiquitin thioester in a wide variety of 
ubiquitylated peptides and proteins for structural and biochemical analysis and 
for the synthesis of ubiquitin chains.
