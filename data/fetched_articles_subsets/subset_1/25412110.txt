Centrioles are microtubule-based organelles important for the formation of 
cilia, flagella and centrosomes. Despite progress in understanding the 
underlying assembly mechanisms, how centriole integrity is ensured is 
incompletely understood, including in sperm cells, where such integrity is 
particularly critical. We identified C. elegans sas-1 in a genetic screen as a 
locus required for bipolar spindle assembly in the early embryo. Our analysis 
reveals that sperm-derived sas-1 mutant centrioles lose their integrity shortly 
after fertilization, and that a related defect occurs when maternal sas-1 
function is lacking. We establish that sas-1 encodes a C2 domain containing 
protein that localizes to centrioles in C. elegans, and which can bind and 
stabilize microtubules when expressed in human cells. Moreover, we uncover that 
SAS-1 is related to C2CD3, a protein required for complete centriole formation 
in human cells and affected in a type of oral-facial-digital (OFD) syndrome.
