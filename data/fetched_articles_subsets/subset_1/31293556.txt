An adenovirus (AdV) has been isolated from the rectal swab of a domestic cat 
(Felis catus) and named feline adenovirus (FeAdV) isolate. It replicates and 
causes cytopathological effects in many human, feline, other mammalian cell 
lines that have both Coxsackie-adenovirus-receptor and integrins. Its antigens 
cross-react with anti-human adenovirus antibodies in immunofluorescence and 
immunocytochemistry assays. Electron microscopy revealed typical extracellular 
icosahedral particles and pseudo arrays inside cells. Sequence analysis of hexon 
and fiber genes indicates that this virus might belong to human adenovirus 
(HAdV) C species and might be a variant of type 1. In the fiber protein, three 
altered amino acids occur in the shaft; four altered residues are found in the 
knob region as compared to a European HAdV might be type 1 isolate (strain 1038, 
D11). One alteration affects amino acid 442 forming an RGS motif in an alanine 
rich region that might be an alternative way to bind integrins with subsequent 
internalization. Substitutions in the hexon sequence are silent. As compared to 
published HAdV sequences, the fiber is related to the original American 
prototype and recently described Taiwanese HAdV 1 isolates, but the hexon 
sequences are related to adenovirus isolates from France, Germany, Japan, and 
Taiwan. Serology carried out on FeAdV infected M426 cells indicates a prevalence 
of IgG in 80% of domestic cats in Delaware, United States. FeAdV isolate seems 
to be a recently recognized virus with possible pathogenic effects and, 
simultaneous human and feline infections are possible. Further molecular and 
biological characterization of this feline adenovirus isolate, as well as 
studies on both human and feline epidemiology and pathomechanisms, especially in 
endangered big cats, are warranted. FeAdV might have further practical 
advantages. Namely, it could be utilized in both human and feline AIDS research, 
developed into diagnostic tools, and gene therapy vectors in the near future.
