BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has promising anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic 
properties, but its clinical utility in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
is unclear.
AIMS: This study aimed to clarify the association between vitamin D levels, 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in vitamin D-related genes, and the 
histopathological severity of disease in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.
METHODS: SNPs in CYP2R1, DHCR7, vitamin D binding protein (GC), CYP27B1, and 
vitamin D receptor (VDR) were determined for 229 consecutive patients with 
biopsy-proven NAFLD.
RESULTS: In this study, vitamin D deficiency defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 
levels of ≤20 ng/mL was found in 151 patients (65.9%). Multivariate analysis 
revealed that cold season, advanced fibrosis, and CYP2R1 rs1993116 genotype 
non-AA were independent factors significantly associated with vitamin D 
deficiency. Old age (p = 5.05 × 10-8), high body mass index (p = 2.13 × 10-2), 
low total-cholesterol (p = 1.46 × 10-4), low serum vitamin D level 
(p = 7.34 × 10-3), and VDR rs1544410 genotype CC (p = 9.15 × 10-3) were 
independent factors associated with advanced liver fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels and the VDR gene SNP were 
significantly and independently associated with the severity of liver fibrosis 
in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.
