INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have suggested that maternal diabetes may have 
programming effect on fetal brain development. However, little is known about 
the association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental disorders in 
offspring that mainly manifest in infancy or early childhood. We aimed to 
examine the association between maternal diabetes before or during pregnancy and 
feeding and eating disorders (FED) in offspring.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 1 193 
891 singletons born in Denmark during 1996-2015. These children were followed 
from birth until the onset of FED, the sixth birthday, death, emigration, or 31 
December 2016, whichever came first. Relative risk of FED was estimated by HRs 
using Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 40 867 (3.4%) children were born to mothers with diabetes 
(20 887 with pregestational diabetes and 19 980 with gestational diabetes). The 
incidence rates of FED were 6.8, 4.6 and 2.9 per 10 000 person-years among 
children of mothers with pregestational diabetes, gestational diabetes and no 
diabetes, respectively. Offspring of mothers with diabetes had a 64% increased 
risk of FED (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.99; p<0.001). The HR for maternal 
pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes was 2.01 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.56; 
p<0.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.72; p=0.097), respectively. The increased 
risk was more pronounced among offspring of mothers with diabetic complications 
(HR 2.97; 95% CI 1.54 to 5.72; p=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes was associated with an increased risk of FED in 
offspring in infancy and early childhood. Our findings can inform clinical 
decisions for better management of maternal diabetes, in particular before 
pregnancy, which can reduce early neurodevelopmental problems in the offspring.
