BACKGROUND: Microvascular injury (MVI) after coronary ischemia-reperfusion is 
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Both ischemia and reperfusion are 
involved in MVI, but to what degree these phases contribute is unknown. 
Understanding the etiology is essential for the development of new potential 
therapies.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Rats were divided into 3 groups receiving either 30 
minutes ischemia, 90 minutes ischemia or 30 minutes ischemia followed by 60 
minutes reperfusion. Subsequently hearts were ex-vivo perfused in a 
Langendorff-model. Fluorescence and electron microscopy was used for analysis of 
capillary density, vascular permeability and ultrastructure. Most MVI was 
observed after 30 minutes ischemia followed by 60 minutes reperfusion. In 
comparison to the 30' and 90' ischemia group, wall thickness decreased (207.0±74 
vs 407.8±75 and 407.5±71, p = 0.02). Endothelial nuclei in the 30'-60' group 
showed irreversible damage and decreased chromatin density variation (50.5±9.4, 
35.4±7.1 and 23.7±3.8, p = 0.03). Cell junction density was lowest in the 
30'-60' group (0.15±0.02 vs 2.5±0.6 and 1.8±0.7, p<0.01). Microsphere 
extravasation was increased in both the 90' ischemia and 30'-60' group.
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemia alone for 90 minutes induces mild morphological changes to 
the coronary microcirculation, with increased vascular permeability. Ischemia 
for 30 minutes, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion, induces massive MVI. This 
shows the direct consequences of reperfusion on the coronary microcirculation. 
These data imply that a therapeutic window exists to protect the 
microcirculation directly upon coronary revascularization.
