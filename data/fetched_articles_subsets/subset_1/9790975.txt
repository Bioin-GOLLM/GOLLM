Alignment of amino acids of the region implicated in glucose binding from a 
series of hexokinases showed that Schizosaccharomyces pombe hexokinase 1 had a 
Ser residue in a place where all other kinases had an Asn. We changed an AGT 
codon to AAT to place an Asn in the Ser213 position. This mutation decreased Km 
for glucose from 9.4 mM to 1.6 mM and the ratio Vmax (Fructose)/Vmax (Glucose) 
from 5 to 2.5. Also the Km for 2-deoxyglucose decreased from 2.7 mM to 0.8 mM. A 
mutation in the similar position of S. pombe hexokinase 2 (Asn196/Ser) increased 
the Km for glucose from 0.16 mM to 0.56 mM. Fermentation of glucose is not 
detectable in a S. pombe mutant with only hexokinase 1 activity but expression 
of the hxk1(S213/N) gene conferred ability to ferment the sugar. While the 
mutated hexokinase 1 partially mimicked S. cerevisiae hexokinase II in 
catabolite repression of invertase, the wild type one could not substitute for 
it.
