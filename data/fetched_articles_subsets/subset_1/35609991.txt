Polypeptides encoded by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of 
functional molecules. However, whether these hidden polypeptides participate in 
the TP53 pathway and play a significant biological role is still unclear. Here, 
we discover that TP53-regulated lncRNAs can encode peptides, two of which are 
functional in various human cell lines. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq 
approaches in HepG2 cells, we systematically identified more than 300 novel 
TP53-regulated lncRNAs and further confirmed that 15 of these TP53-regulated 
lncRNAs encode peptides. Furthermore, several peptides were validated by mass 
spectrometry. Ten of the novel translational lncRNAs are directly inducible by 
TP53 in response to DNA damage. We show that the TP53-inducible peptides 
TP53LC02 and TP53LC04, but not their lncRNAs, can suppress cell proliferation. 
TP53LC04 peptide also has a function associated with cell proliferation by 
regulating the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. This study shows that 
TP53-regulated lncRNAs can encode new functional peptides, leading to the 
expansion of the TP53 tumor-suppressor network and providing novel potential 
targets for cancer therapy.
