BACKGROUND: Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare autosomal dominant 
genodermatosis characterized by skin tumours, including multiple 
fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas and acrochordons. BHD patients also may suffer 
from associated renal and colonic carcinomas. The defective gene in BHD has been 
recently identified and is suspected of being a tumour suppressor gene. Several 
mutations of the BHD gene have been reported only in Caucasian patients.
OBJECTIVES: This study reports the first Asian family that has been demonstrated 
to carry a BHD mutation.
PATIENTS/METHODS: The proband was a 26-year-old Japanese man with multiple 
asymptomatic, soft skin-coloured papules on his face, neck and trunk, which were 
clinically thought to be acrochordon. His father was also affected. 
Histopathologically, the papules revealed a fibrofolliculoma that had a 
circumscribed proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen fibres surrounding an 
abnormal hair follicle.
RESULTS: Mutational analysis of the BHD gene of the proband and the father 
detected 1733insC, a cytosine insertion mutation in an eight-cytosine tract 
(nucleotides 1733-1740) in exon 11. Analysis of fibrofolliculoma in the proband 
showed heterozygous 1733insC mutation, suggesting the absence of loss of 
heterozygosity. Interestingly, previous mutational analysis in Caucasian 
patients revealed that both1733insC and 1733delC mutations were hot spots.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to find the same hot-spot 1733insC mutation 
in Asian kindred. The mutations in this polycytosine tract may have a wide, 
global distribution despite their arising from a different ethnic background.
