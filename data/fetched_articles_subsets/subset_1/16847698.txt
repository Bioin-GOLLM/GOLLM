The two genes SLC24A5 and SLC45A2 were recently identified as major determinants 
of pigmentation in humans and in other vertebrates. The allele p.A111T in the 
former gene and the allele p.L374F in the latter gene are both nearly fixed in 
light-skinned Europeans, and can therefore be considered ancestry informative 
marker (AIMs). AIMs are becoming useful for forensic identification of the 
phenotype from a DNA profile sampled, for example, from a crime scene. Here, we 
generate new allelic data for these two genes from samples of Chinese, Uygurs, 
Ghanaians, South African Xhosa, South African Europeans, and Sri Lankans (Tamils 
and Sinhalese). Our data confirm the earlier results and furthermore demonstrate 
that the SLC45A2 allele is a more specific AIM than the SLC24A5 allele because 
the former clearly distinguishes the Sri Lankans from the Europeans.
