A 2-month-old Simmental heifer presented for acute onset of neurological 
behavior. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of hyponatremia, 
hypochloremia, and hypokalemia that improved with intravenous fluid therapy. 
Despite an initial cessation of neurological signs, symptoms re-emerged, and the 
heifer was euthanized due to poor prognosis. A pituitary abscess (Trueperella 
pyogenes) was observed on gross necropsy, suggesting that the effects of 
panhypopituitarism (inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and/or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 
secretion) may have resulted in the clinical findings. Pituitary abscess 
syndrome carries a poor prognosis due to the inability to penetrate the area 
with systemic antibiotic therapy. These findings highlight the unusual clinical 
presentations that may occur following pituitary abscess syndrome in cattle that 
practitioners need to consider when determining prognosis.
