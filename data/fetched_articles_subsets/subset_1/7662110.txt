Use of insulin's intrinsic tyrosine absorption and fluorescence to monitor its 
interaction with the insulin receptor is limited because the spectral properties 
of the receptor tryptophan residues mask the spectral properties of the hormone 
tyrosine residues. We describe the synthesis of an insulin analog where A14 
tyrosine is replaced by a tryptophan analog, 5-hydroxytryptophan. This insulin 
is spectrally enhanced since 5-hydroxytryptophan has an absorption band above 
300 nm which is at lower energies than the absorption of tryptophan. 
Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence parameters indicate that 
5-hydroxytryptophan reports the same information about the environment of the 
A14 side chain as does the corresponding tryptophan-containing insulin. The 
synthetic hormone is a full agonist compared to porcine insulin, but has 
slightly reduced specific activity. Consequently, this spectrally enhanced 
insulin analog will be useful for hormone-receptor interaction studies since it 
can be observed by both absorption and fluorescence even in the presence of the 
tryptophan-containing receptor.
