The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates tissue homeostasis and remodelling 
through antagonistic effects of noradrenergic sympathetic and cholinergic 
parasympathetic signalling. Despite numerous reports on the induction of 
sympathetic neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), no induction 
methods have effectively derived cholinergic parasympathetic neurons from hPSCs. 
Considering the antagonistic effects of noradrenergic and cholinergic inputs on 
target organs, both sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons are expected to be 
induced. This study aimed to develop a stepwise chemical induction method to 
induce sympathetic-like and parasympathetic-like ANS neurons. Autonomic 
specification was achieved through restricting signals inducing sensory or 
enteric neurogenesis and activating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signals. 
Global mRNA expression analyses after stepwise induction, including single-cell 
RNA-seq analysis of induced neurons and functional assays revealed that each 
induced sympathetic-like or parasympathetic-like neuron acquired pharmacological 
and electrophysiological functional properties with distinct marker expression. 
Further, we identified selective induction methods using appropriate seeding 
cell densities and neurotrophic factor concentrations. Neurons were individually 
induced, facilitating the regulation of the beating rates of hiPSC-derived 
cardiomyocytes in an antagonistic manner. The induction methods yield specific 
neuron types, and their influence on various tissues can be studied by 
co-cultured assays.
