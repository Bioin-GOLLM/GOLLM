PURPOSE: Mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (mIDH1) alters the epigenetic 
regulation of chromatin, leading to a hypermethylation phenotype in adult 
glioma. This work focuses on identifying gene targets epigenetically 
dysregulated by mIDH1 to confer therapeutic resistance to ionizing radiation 
(IR).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated changes in the transcriptome and epigenome in 
a radioresistant mIDH1 patient-derived glioma cell culture (GCC) following 
treatment with an mIDH1-specific inhibitor, AGI-5198. We identified Zinc Finger 
MYND-Type Containing 8 (ZMYND8) as a potential target of mIDH1 reprogramming. We 
suppressed ZMYND8 expression by shRNA knockdown and genetic knockout (KO) in 
mIDH1 glioma cells and then assessed cellular viability to IR. We assessed the 
sensitivity of mIDH1 GCCS to pharmacologic inhibition of ZMYND8-interacting 
partners: HDAC, BRD4, and PARP.
RESULTS: Inhibition of mIDH1 leads to an upregulation of gene networks involved 
in replication stress. We found that the expression of ZMYND8, a regulator of 
DNA damage response, was decreased in three patient-derived mIDH1 GCCs after 
treatment with AGI-5198. Knockdown of ZMYND8 expression sensitized mIDH1 GCCs to 
radiotherapy marked by decreased cellular viability. Following IR, mIDH1 glioma 
cells with ZMYND8 KO exhibit significant phosphorylation of ATM and sustained 
γH2AX activation. ZMYND8 KO mIDH1 GCCs were further responsive to IR when 
treated with either BRD4 or HDAC inhibitors. PARP inhibition further enhanced 
the efficacy of radiotherapy in ZMYND8 KO mIDH1 glioma cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the impact of ZMYND8 in the maintenance of 
genomic integrity and repair of IR-induced DNA damage in mIDH1 glioma. See 
related commentary by Sachdev et al., p. 1648.
