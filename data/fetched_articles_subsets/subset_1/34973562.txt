Inherited antithrombin (AT) deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder 
associated with SERPINC1 mutations. In this study, we generated a human induced 
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line ZZUNEUi014-A from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells of a female AT deficiency patient with the p. W27X (c. 80G > A) mutation 
in SERPINC1. This cell line expressed pluripotency markers, showed normal female 
karyotype and could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro.
