OBJECTIVE: Heat is associated with elevated all-cause mortality, and 
furosemide-induced potassium depletion might be worsened by heat-induced 
sweating. Because empiric potassium is associated with a marked survival benefit 
in users of furosemide at a dose of ≥40 mg/day, we hypothesised that this 
empiric potassium's survival benefit would increase with higher temperature 
(≥24°C).
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Outpatient setting, captured by Medicaid claims, supplemented with 
Medicare claims for dual enrollees, from 5 US states from 1999 to 2010, linked 
to meteorological data.
POPULATION/PARTICIPANTS: Furosemide (≥40 mg/day) initiators among adults 
continuously enrolled in Medicaid for at least 1 year prior to cohort entry 
(defined as the day following the dispensing day of each individual's first 
observed furosemide prescription).
EXPOSURE: Interaction between: (1) empiric potassium, dispensed the day of or 
the day following the dispensing of the initial furosemide prescription, and (2) 
daily average temperature and daily maximum temperature, examined separately.
OUTCOME: All-cause mortality.
RESULTS: In 1:1 propensity score matched cohorts (total n=211 878) that included 
89 335 person-years and 9007 deaths, all-cause mortality rates per 1000 
person-years were 96.0 (95% CI 93.2 to 98.9) and 105.8 (95% CI 102.8 to 108.9) 
for potassium users and non-users, respectively. The adjusted OR of all-cause 
mortality for potassium use declined (ie, its apparent protective effect 
increased) as temperature increased, from a daily average temperature of about 
28°C and a daily maximum temperature of about 31°C. This relationship was not 
statistically significant with daily average temperature, but was statistically 
significant with daily maximum temperature (p values for the interaction of 
potassium with daily maximum temperature and daily maximum temperature squared 
were 0.031 and 0.028, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that empiric potassium's survival benefit among 
furosemide (≥40 mg/day) initiators may increase as daily maximum temperature 
increases. If this relationship is real, use of empiric potassium in Medicaid 
enrollees initiating furosemide might be particularly important on hot days.
