BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between RNA 
polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5)-mediating protein (RMP) and clinicopathological 
characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by measuring the 
expression level of RMP in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines. At the same time, 
we studied the impact of RMP on the biological function of cancer, providing 
strong support for gene targeted therapy of NSCLC.
METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and Western blot were used to determine the expression levels of 
messenger (m)RNA and protein in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. Cell counting kit 
8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry were selected to detect cell proliferation, 
cycle and apoptosis. The wound healing assay was chosen to detect the migration 
and invasion ability of cells. The xenograft model was performed to study the 
function of RMP in vivo. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed the levels of 
RMP, Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3.
RESULTS: First, mRNA and protein levels of RMP were relatively overexpressed in 
NSCLC cells. Compared with the corresponding normal tissues, the mRNA and 
protein levels of RMP were significantly higher in human NSCLC tissues. 
Concurrently, we found that the expression of RMP was related to the status of 
lymph nodes (LNs) in cancer tissues and T stage. Then, RMP overexpression 
promoted the proliferation of A549. At the same time, RMP provided A549 cells 
the ability to resist chemotherapy and radiotherapy; when A549 cells were 
treated with gefitinib and radiation, RMP reduced apoptosis. We also found that 
RMP can protect A549 from G2 block caused by radiation. Over-irradiated 
RMP-overexpressed A549 cells had lower Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) levels 
and higher B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) levels. The migration and invasion ability 
of A549 cells was increased by RMP. Finally, RMP can promote tumor growth by 
increasing Bcl-2 levels and decreasing Bax and caspase-3 levels in the xenograft 
model.
CONCLUSIONS: There is potential for RMP to develop into a diagnostic and 
therapeutic target for NSCLC.
