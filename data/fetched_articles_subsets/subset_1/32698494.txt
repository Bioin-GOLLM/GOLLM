Single-stranded RNA viruses such as alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles viruses 
and rhabdoviruses are characterized by their capacity of highly efficient 
self-amplification of RNA in host cells, which make them attractive vehicles for 
vaccine development. Particularly, alphaviruses and flaviviruses can be 
administered as recombinant particles, layered DNA/RNA plasmid vectors carrying 
the RNA replicon and even RNA replicon molecules. Self-amplifying RNA viral 
vectors have been used for high level expression of viral and tumor antigens, 
which in immunization studies have elicited strong cellular and humoral immune 
responses in animal models. Vaccination has provided protection against 
challenges with lethal doses of viral pathogens and tumor cells. Moreover, 
clinical trials have demonstrated safe application of RNA viral vectors and even 
promising results in rhabdovirus-based phase III trials on an Ebola virus 
vaccine. Preclinical and clinical applications of self-amplifying RNA viral 
vectors have proven efficient for vaccine development and due to the presence of 
RNA replicons, amplification of RNA in host cells will generate superior immune 
responses with significantly reduced amounts of RNA delivered. The need for 
novel and efficient vaccines has become even more evident due to the global 
COVID-19 pandemic, which has further highlighted the urgency in challenging 
emerging diseases.
