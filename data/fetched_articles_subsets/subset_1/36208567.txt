BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has a strong association with atrial 
fibrillation (AF) which increases risk of thromboembolic events, heart failure, 
and frequent hospitalizations. Metformin is the first-line medication for T2D 
with proposed anti-inflammatory, pro-metabolic, and cardio-protective benefits. 
Our objective was to investigate if initial therapy with metformin is associated 
with reduced incidence of AF in comparison to other non-insulin 
anti-hyperglycemic agents in patients with newly diagnosed T2D.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis included adults with a new diagnosis 
of T2D who were started on monotherapy (except insulin) between 2007 and 2017, 
without prior anti-hyperglycemic agent use, history of arrhythmias, or estimated 
GFR (eGFR) ≤ 30 ml/min. A multivariate analysis was performed using a fine-gray 
regression competing risk analysis to control for confounding variables after 
which pooled hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were reported. Patients 
were followed until the end of study date, development of AF, addition of more 
anti-hyperglycemic agents, or death, whichever occurred first.
RESULTS: Among 4584 metformin initiators compared to 1080 non-metformin 
monotherapy initiators, 10-year cumulative incidence of AF in metformin group 
was 5.2 % as compared to 8.1 % with other agents which was not statistically 
significant. Competing risk analysis did not demonstrate reduced rates of AF 
with metformin use (HR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.69 to 1.21; P = 0.55). Increased age and 
the presence of congestive heart failure were associated with significantly 
higher risk of AF in both groups (HR: 1.29, 95 % CI: 1.21 to 1.37; P ≤ 0.001; 
HR: 2.73, 95 % CI: 1.62 to 4.61; P ≤ 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Initiation of metformin as a first line monotherapy for T2D, when 
compared to other non-insulin monotherapies, was not associated with decreased 
risk of developing AF in this retrospective observational study.
