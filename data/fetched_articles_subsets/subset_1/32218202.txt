A DNA micro-optode for dengue virus detection was developed based on the 
sandwich hybridization strategy of DNAs on succinimide-functionalized 
poly(n-butyl acrylate) (poly(nBA-NAS)) microspheres. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) 
with an average diameter of ~20 nm were synthesized using a centrifugation-based 
method and adsorbed on the submicrometer-sized polyelectrolyte-coated 
poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) (PSA) latex particles via an electrostatic method. 
The AuNP-latex spheres were attached to the thiolated reporter probe (rDNA) by 
Au-thiol binding to functionalize as an optical gold-latex-rDNA label. The 
one-step sandwich hybridization recognition involved a pair of a DNA probe, 
i.e., capture probe (pDNA), and AuNP-PSA reporter label that flanked the target 
DNA (complementary DNA (cDNA)). The concentration of dengue virus cDNA was 
optically transduced by immobilized AuNP-PSA-rDNA conjugates as the DNA 
micro-optode exhibited a violet hue upon the DNA sandwich hybridization 
reaction, which could be monitored by a fiber-optic reflectance 
spectrophotometer at 637 nm. The optical genosensor showed a linear reflectance 
response over a wide cDNA concentration range from 1.0 × 10-21 M to 1.0 × 10-12 
M cDNA (R2 = 0.9807) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 × 10-29 M. The DNA 
biosensor was reusable for three consecutive applications after regeneration 
with mild sodium hydroxide. The sandwich-type optical biosensor was well 
validated with a molecular reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) technique for screening of dengue virus in clinical samples, e.g., 
serum, urine, and saliva from dengue virus-infected patients under informed 
consent.
