KEY POINTS: Directionality, inherent to movements, has behavioural and neuronal 
correlates. Direction of vestibular stimulation determines motor learning 
efficiency. Vestibulo-ocular reflex gain-increase correlates with Purkinje cell 
simple spike potentiation. The locus of neural correlates for vestibulo-ocular 
reflex adaptation is paradigm specific.
ABSTRACT: Compensatory eye movements elicited by head rotation, also known as 
vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), can be adapted with the use of visual feedback. 
The cerebellum is essential for this type of movement adaptation, although its 
neuronal correlates remain to be clarified. In the present study, we show that 
the direction of vestibular input determines the magnitude of eye movement 
adaptation induced by mismatched visual input in mice, with larger changes 
during contraversive head rotation. Moreover, the location of the neural 
correlate of this changed behaviour depends on the type of paradigm. 
Gain-increase paradigms induce increased simple spike (SS) activity in 
ipsilateral cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC), which is in line with eye movements 
triggered by optogenetic PC activation. By contrast, gain-decrease paradigms do 
not induce changes in SS activity, indicating that the murine 
vestibulo-cerebellar cortical circuitry is optimally designed to enhance 
ipsiversive eye movements.
