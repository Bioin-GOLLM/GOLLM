Rad51 and Rad54 are key proteins that collaborate during homologous 
recombination. Rad51 forms a presynaptic filament with ATP and ssDNA active in 
homology search and DNA strand exchange, but the precise role of its ATPase 
activity is poorly understood. Rad54 is an ATP-dependent dsDNA motor protein 
that can dissociate Rad51 from dsDNA, the product complex of DNA strand 
exchange. Kinetic analysis of the budding yeast proteins revealed that the 
catalytic efficiency of the Rad54 ATPase was stimulated by partial filaments of 
wild-type and Rad51-K191R mutant protein on dsDNA, unambiguously demonstrating 
that the Rad54 ATPase activity is stimulated under these conditions. Experiments 
with Rad51-K191R as well as with wild-type Rad51-dsDNA filaments formed in the 
presence of ATP, ADP or ATP-gamma-S showed that efficient Rad51 turnover from 
dsDNA requires both the Rad51 ATPase and the Rad54 ATPase activities. The 
results with Rad51-K191R mutant protein also revealed an unexpected defect in 
binding to DNA. Once formed, Rad51-K191R-DNA filaments appeared normal upon 
electron microscopic inspection, but displayed significantly increased 
stability. These biochemical defects in the Rad51-K191R protein could lead to 
deficiencies in presynapsis (filament formation) and postsynapsis (filament 
disassembly) in vivo.
