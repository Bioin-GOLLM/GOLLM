Sister chromatid cohesion essential for mitotic chromosome segregation is 
thought to involve the co-entrapment of sister DNAs within cohesin rings. 
Although cohesin can load onto chromosomes throughout the cell cycle, it only 
builds cohesion during S phase. A key question is whether cohesion is generated 
by conversion of cohesin complexes associated with un-replicated DNAs ahead of 
replication forks into cohesive structures behind them, or from nucleoplasmic 
cohesin that is loaded de novo onto nascent DNAs associated with forks, a 
process that would be dependent on cohesin's Scc2 subunit. We show here that in 
S. cerevisiae, both mechanisms exist and that each requires a different set of 
replisome-associated proteins. Cohesion produced by cohesin conversion requires 
Tof1/Csm3, Ctf4 and Chl1 but not Scc2 while that created by Scc2-dependent de 
novo loading at replication forks requires the Ctf18-RFC complex. The 
association of specific replisome proteins with different types of cohesion 
establishment opens the way to a mechanistic understanding of an aspect of DNA 
replication unique to eukaryotic cells.
