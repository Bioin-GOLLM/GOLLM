Failure of neural tube closure during embryonic development can result in 
anencephaly, one of the most common birth defects in humans. A family with 
recurrent anencephalic fetuses was investigated to understand its etiology and 
pathogenesis. Exome sequencing revealed a recessive germline 21-bp in-frame 
deletion in NUAK2 segregating with the disease. In vitro kinase assays 
demonstrated that the 7-amino acid truncation in NUAK2, a serine/threonine 
kinase, completely abrogated its catalytic activity. Patient-derived disease 
models including neural progenitor cells and cerebral organoids showed that loss 
of NUAK2 activity led to decreased Hippo signaling via cytoplasmic YAP 
retention. In neural tube-like structures, endogenous NUAK2 colocalized apically 
with the actomyosin network, which was disrupted in patient cells, causing 
impaired nucleokinesis and apical constriction. Our results establish NUAK2 as 
an indispensable kinase for brain development in humans and suggest that a 
NUAK2-Hippo signaling axis regulates cytoskeletal processes that govern cell 
shape during neural tube closure.
