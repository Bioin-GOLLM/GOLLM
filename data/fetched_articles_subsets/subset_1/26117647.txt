The anti-protozoal drug pentamidine is active against opportunistic Pneumocystis 
pneumonia, but in addition has several other biological targets, including the 
NMDA receptor (NR). Here we describe the inhibitory potencies of 76 pentamidine 
analogs at 2 binding sites of the NR, the channel binding site labeled with 
[(3)H]MK-801 and the [(3)H]ifenprodil binding site. Most analogs acted weaker at 
the ifenprodil than at the channel site. The spermine-sensitivity of NR 
inhibition by the majority of the compounds was reminiscent of other long-chain 
dicationic NR blockers. The potency of the parent compound as NR blocker was 
increased by modifying the heteroatoms in the bridge connecting the 2 
benzamidine moieties and also by integrating the bridge into a seven-membered 
ring. Docking of the 45 most spermine-sensitive bisbenzamidines to a recently 
described acidic interface between the N-terminal domains of GluN1 and GluN2B 
mediating polyamine stimulation of the NR revealed the domain contributed by 
GluN1 as the most relevant target.
