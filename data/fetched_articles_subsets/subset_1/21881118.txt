To determine genetic factors predisposing to neurological complications 
following West Nile virus infection, we analyzed a cohort of 560 neuroinvasive 
case patients and 950 control patients for 13 371 mostly nonsynonymous 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The top 3 SNPs on the basis of 
statistical significance were also in genes of biological plausibility: 
rs2066786 in RFC1 (replication factor C1) (P = 1.88 × 10(-5); odds ratio [OR], 
0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .56-.81]); rs2298771 in SCN1A (sodium 
channel, neuronal type I α subunit) (P = 5.87 × 10(-5); OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 
1.21-1.77]); and rs25651 in ANPEP (ananyl aminopeptidase) (P = 1.44 × 10(-4); 
OR, 0.69 [95% CI, .56-.83]). Additional genotyping of these SNPs in a separate 
sample of 264 case patients and 296 control patients resulted in a lack of 
significance in the replication cohort; joint significance was as follows: 
rs2066786, P = .0022; rs2298771, P = .005; rs25651, P = .042. Using mostly 
nonsynonymous variants, we therefore did not identify genetic variants 
associated with neuroinvasive disease.
