We investigated effects of pharmacological triggering of exchange protein 
directly activated by cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (Epac) on Nav1.4 
currents from intact murine (C67BL6) skeletal muscle fibres for the first time. 
This employed a loose patch clamp technique which examined ionic currents in 
response to superimposed 10-ms V1 steps to varying degrees of depolarisation, 
followed by V2 steps to a fixed, +100 mV depolarisation relative to resting 
membrane potential following 40 mV hyperpolarising prepulses of 50 ms duration. 
The activation and inactivation properties of the resulting Na+ membrane current 
densities revealed reduced maximum currents and steepnesses in their voltage 
dependences after addition of the Epac activator 
8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (1 µM) to the bathing 
Krebs-Henseleit solutions. Contrastingly, voltages at half-maximal current and 
timecourses of currents obtained in response to the V1 depolarising steps were 
unchanged. These effects were abolished by further addition of the RyR-inhibitor 
dantrolene (10 µM). In contrast, challenge by dantrolene alone left both 
currents and their parameters intact. These effects of Epac activation in 
inhibiting skeletal muscle, Nav1.4, currents, complement similar effects 
previously reported in the homologous Nav1.5 in murine cardiomyocytes. They are 
discussed in terms of a hypothesis implicating Epac actions in increasing 
RyR-mediated SR Ca2+ release resulting in a Ca2+-mediated inhibition of Nav1.4. 
The latter effect may form the basis for Ca2+-dependent Na+ channel 
dysregulation in SCN4A channelopathies associated with cold- and K+-aggravated 
myotonias.
