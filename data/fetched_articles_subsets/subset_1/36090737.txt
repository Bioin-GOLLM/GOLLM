INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin 
disease. It is associated with atopy, impaired skin barrier, skin infections and 
several other comorbidities.
AIM: To identify comorbidities and risk factors that influence the severity of 
AD in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving 52 children 
newly diagnosed with AD. The severity of AD was assessed with the SCORing Atopic 
Dermatitis (SCORAD) clinical tool. Levels of serum tryptase, zinc, selenium, and 
immunoglobulins A, G, M and E (IgA, IgG, IgM, and total IgE, respectively) were 
determined as well as allergen-specific E antibodies (IgE) to the most common 
allergens. DNA samples from venous blood were screened for the most common 
mutations in the filaggrin gene.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 30 months. The median SCORAD index in 
patients with atopy was 47.8, compared to 27.2 in non-atopic patients (p < 
0.01). We also found a significantly higher median SCORAD of 61.2 in patients 
with low serum IgM levels compared to 34.9 in patients with normal serum IgM 
levels (p = 0.03). A history of impetigo was also associated with a higher 
median SCORAD of 56.2 compared to 34.0 in patients without impetigo (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD and sensitisation to common allergens, low levels 
of IgM or a history of impetigo are at risk for more severe disease and, 
therefore, need more attention, meticulous skin care, proactive management and 
treatment of comorbidities, when possible.
