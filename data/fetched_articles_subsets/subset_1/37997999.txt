Abiotic stresses extensively reduce agricultural crop production globally. 
Traditional breeding technology has been the fundamental approach used to cope 
with abiotic stresses. The development of gene editing technology for modifying 
genes responsible for the stresses and the related genetic networks has 
established the foundation for sustainable agriculture against environmental 
stress. Integrated approaches based on functional genomics and transcriptomics 
are now expanding the opportunities to elucidate the molecular mechanisms 
underlying abiotic stress responses. This review summarizes some of the features 
and weblinks of plant genome databases related to abiotic stress genes utilized 
for improving crops. The gene-editing tool based on clustered, regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 
(Cas9) has revolutionized stress tolerance research due to its simplicity, 
versatility, adaptability, flexibility, and broader applications. However, 
off-target and low cleavage efficiency hinder the successful application of 
CRISPR/Cas systems. Computational tools have been developed for designing highly 
competent gRNA with better cleavage efficiency. This powerful genome editing 
tool offers tremendous crop improvement opportunities, overcoming conventional 
breeding techniques' shortcomings. Furthermore, we also discuss the mechanistic 
insights of the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology. This review focused 
on the current advances in understanding plant species' abiotic stress response 
mechanism and applying the CRISPR/Cas system genome editing technology to 
develop crop resilience against drought, salinity, temperature, heavy metals, 
and herbicides.
