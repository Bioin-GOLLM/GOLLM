BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is a common manifestation of antiphospholipid 
syndrome (APS), and is a main concern for bleeding on the standard treatment of 
low dose aspirin (LDA) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in obstetric APS 
(OAPS).
OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the possible relationship between 
thrombocytopenia during the first trimester and adverse pregnancy outcomes 
(APOs) in OAPS patients.
METHODS: A case-control study was conducted at Peking University People's 
Hospital, Beijing, China. The clinical, immunologic, and pregnancy outcomes of 
the OAPS patients were collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic 
regression analyses were applied to assess the relationship between APOs and 
thrombocytopenia in the first trimester.
RESULTS: A total of 115 participants were included in the analysis. There were 
no difference on antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage between the two groups. 
The gestational age in the thrombocytopenia group was less than that in the 
control group (34.12 ± 8.44 vs. 37.44 ± 3.81 weeks, p = 0.002). 
Hypocomplementemia, double aPL positive, and high titers of anti-β2 glycoprotein 
I were more frequent in APS patients with thrombocytopenia (p < 0.05). Compared 
to the control group, thrombocytopenia in the first trimester was correlated 
with SGA (12.12% vs. 31.25%, p = 0.043), premature birth <37 weeks (16.16% vs 
43.75%, p = 0.010) and intrauterine fetal death (2.02% vs 12.50%, p = 0.033). 
Thrombocytopenia in first-trimester independently increased the risk of preterm 
birth <37 weeks (OR = 5.40, 95% CI: 1.35-21.53, p = 0.02) after adjusting for 
demographic and laboratory factors. After adding medication adjustments, these 
factors above become insignificant (p > 0.05). Of note, the number of platelets 
increased after delivery in 14 thrombocytopenia patients with live fetuses (p = 
0.03).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that thrombocytopenia in the first trimester 
increases the risks of preterm birth in women with APS. The effective OAPS 
treatments may improve pregnancy outcomes and not increase the risk of 
antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage.
