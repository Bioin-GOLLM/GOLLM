The two-signal model of T cell activation states that antigen recognition by TCR 
provides a tolerogenic signal (termed Signal 1) unless the T cell receives 
simultaneous costimulation (Signal 2) that permits antigen recognition to prime 
activation. Our efforts to characterize genetic and biochemical factors 
resulting from Signal 1 alone have identified signaling molecules, transcription 
factors, and an epigenetic regulator that each contribute to the anergic 
phenotype observed. However, our most striking finding is that the same factors 
identified using anergy to model T cell activation versus tolerance also 
participate in determining the outcome of the effector phenotype of fully 
activated T cells. We summarize our own findings and other recent advances in 
the genetic and biochemical understanding of T cell activation, tolerance, and 
plasticity in this review.
