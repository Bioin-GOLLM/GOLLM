In this study, two new series of 3-cyanopyridinones (3a-e) and 3-cyanopyridines 
(4a-e) were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxicity and Pim-1 kinase 
inhibitory activity adopting 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl 
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and in vitro Pim-1 kinase inhibition assay, 
respectively. Most of the tested compounds revealed promising cytotoxicity 
against HepG-2, HCT-116, MCF-7, and PC-3 cell lines. Among them, compounds 4c 
and 4d showed more potent cytotoxicity against the HePG2 cell line with IC50 = 
8.02 ± 0.38 and 6.95 ± 0.34 μM, respectively, than that of the reference 5-FU 
(IC50 = 9.42 ± 0.46 μM). Moreover, compound 4c was more potent against HCT-116 
(IC50 = 7.15 ± 0.35 μM) than 5-FU (IC50 = 8.01 ± 0.39 μM), while compound 4d 
with IC50 = 8.35 ± 0.42 μM displayed comparable activity to that of the 
reference drug. Furthermore, high cytotoxic activity was manifested by compounds 
4c and 4d against MCF-7 and PC3 cell lines. Our results have also indicated that 
compounds 4b, 4c, and 4d elicited remarkable inhibition of Pim-1 kinase; 4b and 
4c showed equipotent inhibitory activity to that of the reference quercetagetin. 
Meanwhile, 4d displayed IC50 = 0.46 ± 0.02 μM, showed the best inhibitory 
activity among the tested compounds, and was more potent than quercetagetin 
(IC50 = 0.56 ± 0.03 μM). For optimization of the results, docking study of the 
most potent compounds 4c and 4d in the Pim-1 kinase active site was carried out 
and compared with both quercetagetin and the reported Pim-1 inhibitor A (VRV), 
and the results were consistent with those of the biological study. 
Consequently, compounds 4c and 4d are worthy of further investigations toward 
the discovery of Pim-1 kinase inhibitors as drug candidates for cancer therapy. 
Compound 4b was successfully radiolabeled with radioiodine-131, and its 
biodistribution in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice showed more 
observable uptake in tumor sites, and hence, it can be introduced as a new 
radiolabeled agent for tumor imaging and therapy.
