The oncogenic AKT kinase is a key regulator of apoptosis, cell growth, and 
cell-cycle progression. Despite its important role in proliferation, it remains 
largely unknown how AKT is mechanistically linked to the cell cycle. We show 
here that cyclin F, a substrate receptor F-box protein for the SCF 
(Skp1/Cul1/F-box) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is a bona fide AKT substrate. 
Cyclin F expression oscillates throughout the cell cycle, a rare feature among 
the 69 human F-box proteins, and all of its known substrates are involved in 
proliferation. AKT phosphorylation of cyclin F enhances its stability and 
promotes assembly into productive E3 ligase complexes. Importantly, expression 
of mutant versions of cyclin F that cannot be phosphorylated by AKT impair 
cell-cycle entry. Our data suggest that cyclin F transmits mitogen signaling 
through AKT to the core cell-cycle machinery. This discovery has potential 
implications for proliferative control in malignancies where AKT is activated.
