Embryonic formation and patterning of the vertebrate spinal column requires 
coordination of many molecular cues. After birth, the integrity of the spine is 
impacted by developmental abnormalities of the skeletal, muscular and nervous 
systems, which may result in deformities, such as kyphosis and scoliosis. We 
sought to identify novel genetic mouse models of severe spine deformity by 
implementing in vivo skeletal radiography as part of a high-throughput 
saturation mutagenesis screen. We report selected examples of genetic mouse 
models following radiographic screening of 54,497 mice from 1275 pedigrees. An 
estimated 30.44% of autosomal genes harbored predicted damaging alleles examined 
twice or more in the homozygous state. Of the 1275 pedigrees screened, 7.4% 
presented with severe spine deformity developing in multiple mice, and of these, 
meiotic mapping implicated N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea alleles in 21% of pedigrees. 
Our study provides proof of concept that saturation mutagenesis is capable of 
discovering novel mouse models of human disease, including conditions with 
skeletal, neural and neuromuscular pathologies. Furthermore, we report a mouse 
model of skeletal disease, including severe spine deformity, caused by recessive 
mutation in Scube3. By integrating results with a human clinical exome database, 
we identified a patient with undiagnosed skeletal disease who harbored recessive 
mutations in SCUBE3, and we demonstrated that disease-associated mutations are 
associated with reduced transactivation of Smad signaling in vitro. All 
radiographic results and mouse models are made publicly available through the 
Mutagenetix online database with the goal of advancing understanding of spine 
development and discovering novel mouse models of human disease.
