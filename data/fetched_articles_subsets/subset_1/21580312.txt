In the title compound, C(11)H(14)N(2)O(5)S, the amide O atom acts as a 
hydrogen-bond acceptor from a carboxyl-ate O atom and a secondary amino N atom. 
In addition, one of the sulfonyl O atoms and the carbonyl O atom of the carboxyl 
group also form hydrogen bonds with the primary amido N atom. These 
intermolecular hydrogen-bonding inter-actions give rise to a layer structure, 
with the layers parallel to the ac plane.
