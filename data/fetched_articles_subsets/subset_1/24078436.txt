before in a family context.

The cause of familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) remains unknown in a 
high percentage of cases, but the AIP gene plays an important role in the 
etiology. The aim of the study is to describe a family with FIPA syndrome and 
the results of genomic studies. A 16-year-old man had a giant prolactinoma 
resistant tomedical treatment with delayed growth and pubertal development. His 
mother had been previously diagnosed with a nonfunctioning pituitary 
macroadenoma. Transsphenoidal endoscopic resection was performed and a genetic 
study revealed a heterozygous mutation in exon 6: 974G>A (p.Arg325Gln). Because 
the AIP gene is a tumor suppressor gene, we searched for loss of heterozygosity 
within the AIP gene by amplifying exon 6 from tumor tissue of the patient. In 
the electropherogram, only the A allele was amplified (hemizygous state), 
indicating loss of the normal allele. We report a Spanish family with FIPA in 
whom a mutation in the AIP gene previously unreported in a familiar context was 
identified.
