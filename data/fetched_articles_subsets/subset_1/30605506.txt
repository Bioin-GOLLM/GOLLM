AIMS: Increase of cardiac cAMP bioavailability and PKA activity through 
adenylyl-cyclase 8 (AC8) overexpression enhances contractile function in young 
transgenic mice (AC8TG). Ageing is associated with decline of cardiac 
contraction partly by the desensitization of β-adrenergic/cAMP signalling. Our 
objective was to evaluate cardiac cAMP signalling as age increases between 
2 months and 12 months and to explore whether increasing the bioavailability of 
cAMP by overexpression of AC8 could prevent cardiac dysfunction related to age.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac cAMP pathway and contractile function were 
evaluated in AC8TG and their non-transgenic littermates (NTG) at 2- and 12 
months old. AC8TG demonstrated increased AC8, PDE1, 3B and 4D expression at both 
ages, resulting in increased phosphodiesterase and PKA activity, and increased 
phosphorylation of several PKA targets including 
sarco(endo)plasmic-reticulum-calcium-ATPase (SERCA2a) cofactor phospholamban 
(PLN) and GSK3α/β a main regulator of hypertrophic growth and ageing. Confocal 
immunofluorescence revealed that the major phospho-PKA substrates were 
co-localized with Z-line in 2-month-old NTG but with Z-line interspace in AC8TG, 
confirming the increase of PKA activity in the compartment of PLN/SERCA2a. In 
both 12-month-old NTG and AC8TG, PLN and GSK3α/β phosphorylation was increased 
together with main localization of phospho-PKA substrates in Z-line interspaces. 
Haemodynamics demonstrated an increased contractile function in 2- and 
12-month-old AC8TG, but not in NTG. In contrast, echocardiography and tissue 
Doppler imaging (TDI) performed in conscious mice unmasked myocardial 
dysfunction with a decrease of systolic strain rate in both old AC8TG and NTG. 
In AC8TG TDI showed a reduced strain rate even in 2-month-old animals. 
Development of age-related cardiac dysfunction was accelerated in AC8TG, leading 
to heart failure (HF) and premature death. Histological analysis confirmed early 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis in AC8TG when compared with 
NTG.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated an early and accelerated cardiac remodelling 
in AC8TG mice, leading to the development of HF and reduced lifespan. 
Age-related reorganization of cAMP/PKA signalling can accelerate cardiac ageing, 
partly through GSK3α/β phosphorylation.
