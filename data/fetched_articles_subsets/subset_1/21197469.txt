E-cadherin is the primary cell adhesion molecule within the epithelium, and loss 
of this protein is associated with a more aggressive tumour phenotype and poorer 
patient prognosis in many cancers. Loss of E-cadherin is a defining 
characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated 
with tumour cell metastasis. We have previously demonstrated an EMT event during 
embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, and that loss of E-cadherin in these 
cells results in altered growth factor response and changes in cell surface 
localisation of promigratory molecules. We discuss the implication of loss of 
E-cadherin in ES cells within the context of cancer stem cells and current 
models of tumorigenesis. We propose that aberrant E-cadherin expression is a 
critical contributing factor to neoplasia and the early stages of tumorigenesis 
in the absence of EMT by altering growth factor response of the cells, resulting 
in increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and acquisition of a stem 
cell-like phenotype.
