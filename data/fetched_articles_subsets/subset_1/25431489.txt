Norovirus gastroenteritis is a major public health burden worldwide. Although 
fecal shedding is important for transmission of enteric viruses, little is known 
about the immune factors that restrict persistent enteric infection. We report 
here that although the cytokines interferon-α (IFN-α) and IFN-β prevented the 
systemic spread of murine norovirus (MNoV), only IFN-λ controlled persistent 
enteric infection. Infection-dependent induction of IFN-λ was governed by the 
MNoV capsid protein and correlated with diminished enteric persistence. 
Treatment of established infection with IFN-λ cured mice in a manner requiring 
nonhematopoietic cell expression of the IFN-λ receptor, Ifnlr1, and independent 
of adaptive immunity. These results suggest the therapeutic potential of IFN-λ 
for curing virus infections in the gastrointestinal tract.
