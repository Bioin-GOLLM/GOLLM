BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Few studies have assessed the effect of the NPY gene 
rs16147 variant on metabolic response following a dietary intervention. We 
evaluated the effect of rs16147 on body weight and biochemical changes after a 
high-protein/low-carbohydrate hypocaloric diet compared with a standard severe 
hypocaloric diet over 9 months.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A population of 270 obese individuals was enrolled. At 
baseline, participants were randomly allocated to one of two hypocaloric diets, 
high protein (Diet HP) or standard (Diet S), for a period of 9 months.
RESULTS: After both diets, all genotypes showed decreased body mass index, 
weight, fat mass, waist circumference, and leptin levels. Participants with the 
minor allele (A) assigned to the HP diet showed decreases in total cholesterol 
(-6.5 ± 4.8 vs 10.1 ± 4.1 mg/dL; p < 0.05), LDL cholesterol (-5.9 ± 3.8 vs 
9.6 ± 2.4 mg/dL; p < 0.05), triglycerides (-1.0 ± 4.8 vs 16.2 ± 4.1 mg/dL; 
p < 0.05), insulin (-0.5 ± 2.8 vs 1.7 ± 2.1 UI/L; p < 0.05), HOMA-IR (-0.2 ± 2.1 
vs 0.5 ± 2.0 units; p < 0.05), and CRP (-0.3 ± 0.4 vs 1.3 ± 0.2 mg/dL; 
p < 0.05). Participants with the minor allele assigned to diet S also showed 
decreases in total cholesterol (-6.1 ± 4.1 vs 14.4 ± 3.1 mg/dL; p < 0.05), 
LDL-cholesterol (-3.1 ± 2.8 vs 15.0 ± 3.1 mg/dL; p < 0.05), triglycerides 
(-6.9 ± 4.1 vs 13.2 ± 4.0 mg/dL; p < 0.05), insulin (-0.3 ± 2.1 vs. -1.2 ± 0.2 
UI/L: p < 0.05), HOMA-IR (-0.3 ± 2.1 vs. -1.6 ± 1.1 units: p < 0.05), and CRP 
(-0.4 ± 0.1 vs 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/dL; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In obese Caucasians, the presence of the A allele of the rs16147 
genetic variant produces a better metabolic response that is secondary to weight 
loss with two different hypocaloric diets.
