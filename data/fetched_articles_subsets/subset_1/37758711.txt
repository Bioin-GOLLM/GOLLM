HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer accounts for 20-25% of all breast cancers. 
Predictive biomarkers of neoadjuvant therapy response are needed to better 
identify patients with early stage disease who may benefit from tailored 
treatments in the adjuvant setting. As part of the TCHL phase-II clinical trial 
(ICORG10-05/NCT01485926) whole exome DNA sequencing was carried out on 
normal-tumour pairs collected from 22 patients. Here we report predictive 
modelling of neoadjuvant therapy response using clinicopathological and genomic 
features of pre-treatment tumour biopsies identified age, estrogen receptor (ER) 
status and level of immune cell infiltration may together be important for 
predicting response. Clonal evolution analysis of longitudinally collected 
tumour samples show subclonal diversity and dynamics are evident with potential 
therapy resistant subclones detected. The sources of greater pre-treatment 
immunogenicity associated with a pathological complete response is largely 
unexplored in HER2+ tumours. However, here we point to the possibility of APOBEC 
associated mutagenesis, specifically in the ER-neg/HER2+ subtype as a potential 
mediator of this immunogenic phenotype.
