Understanding the longitudinal dynamics of antibody immunity following 
heterologous SAR-CoV-2 breakthrough infection will inform the development of 
next-generation vaccines. Here, we track SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain 
(RBD)-specific antibody responses up to six months following Omicron BA.1 
breakthrough infection in six mRNA-vaccinated individuals. Cross-reactive serum 
neutralizing antibody and memory B cell (MBC) responses decline by two- to 
four-fold through the study period. Breakthrough infection elicits minimal de 
novo Omicron BA.1-specific B cell responses but drives affinity maturation of 
pre-existing cross-reactive MBCs toward BA.1, which translates into enhanced 
breadth of activity across other variants. Public clones dominate the 
neutralizing antibody response at both early and late time points following 
breakthough infection, and their escape mutation profiles predict newly emergent 
Omicron sublineages, suggesting that convergent antibody responses continue to 
shape SARS-CoV-2 evolution. While the study is limited by our relatively small 
cohort size, these results suggest that heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variant exposure 
drives the evolution of B cell memory, supporting the continued development of 
next-generation variant-based vaccines.
