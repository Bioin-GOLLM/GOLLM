Cytokines are proteins secreted by immune cells. They promote cell signal 
transduction and are involved in cell replication, death, and recovery. 
Cytokines are immune modulators, but their excessive secretion causes 
uncontrolled inflammation that attacks normal cells. Considering the properties 
of cytokines, monitoring the secretion of cytokines in vivo is of great value 
for medical and biological research. In this review, we offer a report on recent 
studies for cytokine detection, especially studies on aptasensors using 
aptamers. Aptamers are single strand nucleic acids that form a stable 
three-dimensional structure and have been receiving attention due to various 
characteristics such as simple production methods, low molecular weight, and 
ease of modification while performing a physiological role similar to 
antibodies.
