Neddylation is a process similar to ubiquitination, and is critical in various 
inflammatory diseases; however, its importance in the pathogenesis of 
inflammatory arthritis is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of 
neddylation in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and its clinical relevance. We 
showed that neddylation-related genes, including NEDD8 and CULLIN-1, were 
significantly upregulated in inflamed arthritic synovia. Functionally, 
neddylation activation was crucial for synovitis of CIA, as the inhibition of 
neddylation by MLN4924 significantly suppressed synovial cell proliferation and 
inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, neddylation mediated inflammatory 
arthritis by regulating NF-κB activation in fibroblast-like synovial cells 
(FLSs). Furthermore, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) neddylation at 
Lys124 was essential for IL-17A-induced NF-κB activation. Replacing the Lys-124 
residue with Arg (K124R) resulted in significantly impaired conjugation of NEDD8 
to TRAF6, as well as markedly attenuated IL-17A-induced NF-κB activity. 
Therefore, the pathogenic role of neddylation in CIA as well as its mechanism of 
action demonstrated here provides a new insight into understanding the role of 
post-transcriptional modifications in the arthritis inflammatory response.
