Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common chronic pain syndrome that affects 1% to 5% of the 
population. We aimed to investigate the role of endothelial dysfunction and 
autophagy in fibromyalgia-related vascular and cerebral cortical changes in a 
reserpine-induced rat model of fibromyalgia at the histological and molecular 
levels and to study the ameliorative effect of fisetin. Forty adult female 
albino rats were divided into four groups (10 each): two control groups, the 
reserpine-induced fibromyalgia group, and the fisetin-treated group. The carotid 
arteries and brains of the animals were dissected. Frozen tissue samples were 
used for total RNA extraction and qPCR analysis of eNOS, caspase-3, Bcl-2, LC-3, 
BECN-1, CHOP, and TNF-α expression. Histological, immunohistochemical (eNOS), 
and ultrastructure studies were conducted. The carotid arteries revealed 
excessive autophagy and endothelial, vascular, and apoptotic changes. The 
cerebral cortex showed similar findings apart from endoplasmic reticulum stress. 
Additionally, there was decreased gene expression of eNOS and Bcl-2 and 
increased expression of caspase-3, LC-3, BECN-1, CHOP, and TNF-α. In the 
fisetin-treated rats, improvements in the histological and molecular results 
were detected. In conclusion, oxidative stress, enhanced apoptosis, and 
excessive autophagy are fundamental pathophysiologic mechanisms of 
reserpine-induced fibromyalgia. Moreover, fisetin has an ameliorative effect 
against fibromyalgia.
