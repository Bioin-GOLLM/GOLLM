Corydoras is a speciose catfish genus from South America with widely 
investigated phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships. The complete 
mitogenomes of C.aeneus and C.paleatus were sequenced, assembled, and annotated 
using next-generation sequencing. The genome arrangements, gene contents, genome 
structures, base compositions, evolutionary features, codon usage, and tRNA 
structures of the two mitogenomes were compared and analyzed with nine published 
mitogenomes of Corydoras. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using concatenated 
nucleotide sequences with 13 protein-coding genes and two rRNAs with 44 
mitogenomes of Siluriformes. These results provide information on the 
mitogenomes of eleven Corydoras species and evolutionary relationships within 
the suborder Loricarioidei, which may be applicable for further phylogenetic and 
taxonomic studies on Siluriformes and Loricarioidei.
