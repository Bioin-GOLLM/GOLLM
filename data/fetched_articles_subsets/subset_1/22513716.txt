The dopaminergic brain pathway is involved in many addictive behaviours, hence 
represents a good candidate in the study of smoking behaviour and nicotine 
addiction. Dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH) is an enzyme that catalyses the 
conversion of dopamine into noradrenaline. This study, the first of its kind, 
was done to investigate the role of DBH rs5320 polymorphism in smoking behaviour 
of elderly Japanese. This was done by collecting blood samples from 2521 
subjects with various smoking habits to genotype the DBH rs5320 polymorphism. 
Participants also had to fill out a questionnaire containing questions regarding 
their lifestyles. Some of the questions were from the Fagerstr√∂m Test for 
Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and the Tobacco Dependence Screener (TDS). It was 
found that male ever-smokers with AA genotype smoked less cigarettes per day 
than those with GG and AG genotypes. FTND scores were also lowest in male 
ever-smokers with AA genotype and in female ever-smokers with AG genotype. There 
was no correlation detected between the TDS scores and any of the genotypes. 
This study shows that DBH rs5320 polymorphism influences nicotine dependence.
