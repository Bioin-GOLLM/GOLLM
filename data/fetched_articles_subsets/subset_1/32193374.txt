Genetic variation in the FAM13A (Family with Sequence Similarity 13 Member A) 
locus has been associated with several glycemic and metabolic traits in 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we demonstrate that in humans, 
FAM13A alleles are associated with increased FAM13A expression in subcutaneous 
adipose tissue (SAT) and an insulin resistance-related phenotype (e.g. higher 
waist-to-hip ratio and fasting insulin levels, but lower body fat). In human 
adipocyte models, knockdown of FAM13A in preadipocytes accelerates adipocyte 
differentiation. In mice, Fam13a knockout (KO) have a lower visceral to 
subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio after high-fat diet challenge, in comparison to 
their wild-type counterparts. Subcutaneous adipocytes in KO mice show a size 
distribution shift toward an increased number of smaller adipocytes, along with 
an improved adipogenic potential. Our results indicate that GWAS-associated 
variants within the FAM13A locus alter adipose FAM13A expression, which in turn, 
regulates adipocyte differentiation and contribute to changes in body fat 
distribution.
