Anti-microbial peptides play a vital role in the defense mechanisms of various 
organisms performing functions that range from the elimination of 
microorganisms, through diverse mechanisms, to the modulation of the immune 
response, providing protection to the host. Among these peptides, cathelicidins, 
a well-studied family of anti-microbial peptides, are found in various animal 
species, including reptiles. Due to the rise in anti-microbial resistance, these 
compounds have been suggested as potential candidates for developing new drugs. 
In this study, we identified and characterized a cathelicidin-like peptide 
called Aquiluscidin (Aq-CATH) from transcripts obtained from the skin and oral 
mucosa of the Querétaro's dark rattlesnake, Crotalus aquilus. The cDNA was 
cloned, sequenced, and yielded a 566-base-pair sequence. Using bioinformatics, 
we predicted that the peptide precursor contains a signal peptide, a 
101-amino-acid conserved cathelin domain, an anionic region, and a 34-amino-acid 
mature peptide in the C-terminal region. Aq-CATH and a derived 23-amino-acid 
peptide (Vcn-23) were synthesized, and their anti-microbial activity was 
evaluated against various species of bacteria in in vitro assays. The minimal 
inhibitory concentrations against bacteria ranged from 2 to 8 μg/mL for both 
peptides. Furthermore, at concentrations of up to 50 μM, they exhibited no 
significant hemolytic activity (<2.3% and <1.2% for Aquiluscidin and Vcn-23, 
respectively) against rat erythrocytes and displayed no significant cytotoxic 
activity at low concentrations (>65% cell viability at 25 µM). Finally, this 
study represents the first identification of an antimicrobial peptide in 
Crotalus aquilus, which belongs to the cathelicidin family and exhibits the 
characteristic features of these peptides. Both Aq-CATH and its derived 
molecule, Vcn-23, displayed remarkable inhibitory activity against all tested 
bacteria, highlighting their potential as promising candidates for further 
antimicrobial research.
