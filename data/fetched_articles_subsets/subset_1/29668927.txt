Elevated dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 in cardiomyopathy caused by

cardiac function and survival.

Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) encoding the nuclear intermediate 
filament proteins lamins A and C cause a group of tissue-selective diseases, the 
most common of which is dilated cardiomyopathy (herein referred to as LMNA 
cardiomyopathy) with variable skeletal muscle involvement. We previously showed 
that cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of dual specificity protein 
phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) is involved in the pathogenesis of LMNA cardiomyopathy. 
However, how mutations in LMNA activate Dusp4 expression and whether it is 
necessary for the development of LMNA cardiomyopathy are currently unknown. We 
now show that female LmnaH222P/H222P mice, a model for LMNA cardiomyopathy, have 
increased Dusp4 expression and hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) 1/2 with delayed kinetics relative to male mice, consistent with 
the sex-dependent delay in the onset and progression of disease. 
Mechanistically, we show that the H222P amino acid substitution in lamin A 
enhances its binding to ERK1/2 and increases sequestration at the nuclear 
envelope. Finally, we show that genetic deletion of Dusp4 has beneficial effects 
on heart function and prolongs survival in LmnaH222P/H222P mice. These results 
further establish Dusp4 as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of LMNA 
cardiomyopathy and a potential target for drug therapy.
