Differentiation of B lymphocytes is accompanied by a regulated switch in the 
expression pattern and stability of surface and secretory immunoglobulins (Igs). 
Several lines of evidence show that autoimmune responses evolving in much 
autoimmune pathologies were associated with a high level of humoral Ig, but 
their pathogenic role remains elusive. The aim of this study was to test the 
hypothesis that variants at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain IGH locus are genetic 
determinants to T1D susceptibility. Here, we tested the genetic association of 
the variants of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain IGH locus as a genetic 
determinant to T1D susceptibility. A total of 255 subjects from 59 Tunisian 
families were genotyped for 15 SNPs mapping in 4 regions in IGH locus. We found 
that rs1950942, rs2180790, rs1808152, and rs1956596 of IGHM and rs2516751 
variant located in the IGHA1/IGHG2 region were significantly associated with a 
risk for T1D p = 7E-3; p = 0.03; p = 0.02; p = 0.043; and p = 3.65E-5, 
respectively. The TATGG haplotype derived from LD across three SNPs from IGHM 
gene and two SNPs from IGHD gene was significantly over-transmitted from parents 
to affect offspring. Our results suggest that genetic variants at the IGH locus 
are associated with T1D susceptibility. These variations may predispose to IgG 
AutoAbs production against pancreatic antigens and AutoAbs multi-reactivity, 
leading to T1D development.
