Alternative polyadenylation (APA) enables a gene to generate multiple 
transcripts with different 3' ends, which is dynamic across different cell types 
or conditions. Many computational methods have been developed to characterize 
sample-specific APA using the corresponding RNA-seq data, but suffered from high 
error rate on both polyadenylation site (PAS) identification and quantification 
of PAS usage (PAU), and bias toward 3' untranslated regions. Here we developed a 
tool for APA identification and quantification (APAIQ) from RNA-seq data, which 
can accurately identify PAS and quantify PAU in a transcriptome-wide manner. 
Using 3' end-seq data as the benchmark, we showed that APAIQ outperforms current 
methods on PAS identification and PAU quantification, including DaPars2, 
Aptardi, mountainClimber, SANPolyA, and QAPA. Finally, applying APAIQ on 421 
RNA-seq samples from liver cancer patients, we identified >540 tumor-associated 
APA events and experimentally validated two intronic polyadenylation candidates, 
demonstrating its capacity to unveil cancer-related APA with a large-scale 
RNA-seq data set.
