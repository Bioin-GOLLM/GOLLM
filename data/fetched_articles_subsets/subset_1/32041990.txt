Activation of the inflammasome is involved in the progression of retinal 
degenerative diseases, in particular, in the pathogenesis of Age-Related Macular 
Degeneration (AMD), with NLRP3 activation the focus of many investigations. In 
this study, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to explore the role 
of the inflammasome in a mouse model of retinal degeneration. We identify that 
Casp1/11-/- mice have better-preserved retinal function, reduced inflammation 
and increased photoreceptor survivability. While Nlrp3-/- mice display some 
level of preservation of retinal function compared to controls, pharmacological 
inhibition of NLRP3 did not protect against photoreceptor cell death. Further, 
Aim2-/-, Nlrc4-/-, Asc-/-, and Casp11-/- mice show no substantial retinal 
protection. We propose that CASP-1-associated photoreceptor cell death occurs 
largely independently of NLRP3 and other established inflammasome sensor 
proteins, or that inhibition of a single sensor is not sufficient to repress the 
inflammatory cascade. Therapeutic targeting of CASP-1 may offer a more promising 
avenue to delay the progression of retinal degenerations.
