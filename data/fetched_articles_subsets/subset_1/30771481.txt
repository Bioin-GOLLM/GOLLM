Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune lymphocytes with a key role in host 
defense against HIV infection. Recent advances in chimeric antigen receptors 
(CARs) have made NK cells a prime target for expressing recombinant receptors 
capable of redirecting NK cytotoxic functions towards HIV-infected cells. In 
this review, we discuss the role of NK cells in HIV and the mechanisms of 
actions of HIV-targeting CAR strategies. Furthermore, we also review NK cells 
signal transduction and its application to CAR NK cell strategies to develop new 
combinations of CAR intracellular domains and to improve CAR NK signaling and 
cytotoxic functions.
