Membrane peptidases are a multifunctional group of ectoenzymes that have been 
implicated in the control of growth and differentiation of many cellular 
systems. Here, using aminopeptidase N/CD13 as an example, Dagmar Riemann and 
colleagues discuss the role of cell-cell contact in peptidase regulation and the 
influence of peptidases on cellular functions.
