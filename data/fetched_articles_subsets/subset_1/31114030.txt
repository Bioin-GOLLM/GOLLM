Newly synthesized mitochondrial precursor proteins have to become unfolded to 
cross the mitochondrial membranes. This unfolding is achieved primarily by 
mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) for presequence-containing precursor proteins. 
However, the membrane potential across the inner membrane (ΔΨ) could also 
contribute to unfolding of short-presequence containing mitochondrial precursor 
proteins. Here we investigated the role of ΔΨ in mitochondrial protein unfolding 
and import. We found that the effects of mutations in the presequence on import 
rates are correlated well with the hydrophobicity or ability to interact with 
import motor components including mtHsp70, but not with ΔΨ (negative inside). A 
spontaneously unfolded precursor protein with a short presequence is therefore 
trapped by motor components including mtHsp70, but not ΔΨ, which could cause 
global unfolding of the precursor protein. Instead, ΔΨ may contribute the 
precursor unfolding by holding the presequence at the inner membrane for 
trapping of the unfolded species by the import motor system.
