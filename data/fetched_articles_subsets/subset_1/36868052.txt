BACKGROUND: Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is being explored as biomarker for 
non-invasive diagnosis of cancer. We aimed to establish a cfDNA-based DNA 
methylation marker panel to differentially diagnose papillary thyroid carcinoma 
(PTC) from benign thyroid nodule (BTN).
METHODS: 220 PTC- and 188 BTN patients were enrolled. Methylation markers of PTC 
were identified from patients' tissue and plasma by reduced representation 
bisulfite sequencing and methylation haplotype analyses. They were combined with 
PTC markers from literatures and were tested on additional PTC and BTN samples 
to verify PTC-detecting ability using targeted methylation sequencing. Top 
markers were developed into ThyMet and were tested in 113 PTC and 88 BTN cases 
to train and validate a PTC-plasma classifier. Integration of ThyMet and thyroid 
ultrasonography was explored to improve accuracy.
FINDINGS: From 859 potential PTC plasma-discriminating markers that include 81 
markers identified by us, the top 98 most PTC plasma-discriminating markers were 
selected for ThyMet. A 6-marker ThyMet classifier for PTC plasma was trained. In 
validation it achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.828, similar to 
thyroid ultrasonography (0.833) but at higher specificity (0.722 and 0.625 for 
ThyMet and ultrasonography, respectively). A combinatorial classifier by them, 
ThyMet-US, improved AUC to 0.923 (sensitivity = 0.957, specificity = 0.708).
INTERPRETATION: The ThyMet classifier improved the specificity of 
differentiating PTC from BTN over ultrasonography. The combinatorial ThyMet-US 
classifier may be effective in preoperative diagnosis of PTC.
