Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) gain-of-function 
(GOF) mutations result in a primary immunodeficiency (PID) characterized 
typically by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), but a wider phenotypic 
range is reported and remains unexplained from a pathophysiological 
point-of-view. We hypothesized that different STAT1 GOF mutations may result in 
distinct molecular mechanisms, possibly explaining the variable phenotypes 
observed in patients. We selected STAT1 GOF mutants (R274W, R321S, T419R, and 
N574I) that are spread over the protein and studied their dynamic behavior in 
vitro in U3A and HeLa cell lines. All GOF mutants showed increased STAT1 
phosphorylation compared to STAT1 WT. Real-time imaging demonstrated three 
underlying mechanisms for STAT1 GOF: (i) R274W showed a faster nuclear 
accumulation, (ii) both R321S and N574I showed a reduced nuclear mobility and 
slower dephosphorylation, whereas (iii) T419R was near-immobile in the nucleus, 
potentially due to enhanced binding to chromatin.
