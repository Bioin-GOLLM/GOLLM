Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes either a latent (non-productive) or 
lytic (productive) infection depending upon cell type, cytokine milieu and the 
differentiation status of the infected cell. Undifferentiated cells, such as 
precursor cells of the myeloid lineage, support a latent infection whereas 
terminally differentiated cells, such as monocytes or dendritic cells are an 
environment conducive to reactivation and support a lytic infection. The 
mechanisms which regulate HCMV in either a latent or lytic infection have been 
the focus of intense investigation with a view to developing novel treatments 
for HCMV-associated disease which can have a heavy clinical burden after 
reactivation or primary infection in, especially, the immune compromised. To 
this end, a number of studies have been carried out in an unbiased manner to 
address global changes occurring within the latently infected cell to address 
the molecular changes associated with HCMV latency. In this review, we will 
concentrate on the proteomic analyses which have been carried out in 
undifferentiated myeloid cells which either stably express specific viral 
latency associated genes in isolation or on cells which have been latently 
infected with virus.
