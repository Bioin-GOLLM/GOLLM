BACKGROUD: BST-2 is an interferon-induced host restriction factor that inhibits 
the release of diverse mammalian enveloped viruses from infected cells by 
physically trapping the newly formed virions onto the host cell surface. Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) encodes an accessory protein Vpu that 
antagonizes BST-2 by down-regulating BST-2 from the cell surface.
RESULTS: Using a cell-based ELISA screening system, we have discovered a lead 
compound, 2-thio-6-azauridine, that restores cell surface BST-2 level in the 
presence of Vpu. This compound has no effect on the expression of BST-2 and Vpu, 
but inhibits Vpu-mediated BST-2 down-regulation and exerts no effect on 
Vpu-induced down-regulation of CD4 or KSHV K5 protein induced BST-2 
down-regulation. 2-thio-6-azauridine suppresses HIV-1 production in a 
BST-2-dependent manner. Further results indicate that 2-thio-6-azauridine does 
not interrupt the interaction of BST-2 with Vpu and Î²-TrCP2, but decreases BST-2 
ubiquitination.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using small molecules to 
target Vpu function and sensitize wild type HIV-1 to BST-2-mediated host 
restriction.
