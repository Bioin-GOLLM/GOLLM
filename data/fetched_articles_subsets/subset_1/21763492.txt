Initiation of reverse transcription of genomic RNA is a key early step in 
replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) upon infection of a host 
cell. Viral reverse transcriptase initiates from a specific RNA-RNA complex 
formed between a host transfer RNA (tRNA(Lys)(3)) and a region at the 5' end of 
genomic RNA; the 3' end of the tRNA acts as a primer for reverse transcription 
of genomic RNA. We report here the secondary structure of the HIV genomic 
RNA-human tRNA(Lys)(3) initiation complex using heteronuclear nuclear magnetic 
resonance methods. We show that both RNAs undergo large-scale conformational 
changes upon complex formation. Formation of the 18-bp primer helix with the 3' 
end of tRNA(Lys)(3) drives large conformational rearrangements of the tRNA at 
the 5' end while maintaining the anticodon loop for potential loop-loop 
interactions. HIV RNA forms an intramolecular helix adjacent to the 
intermolecular primer helix. This helix, which must be broken by reverse 
transcription, likely acts as a kinetic block to reverse transcription.
