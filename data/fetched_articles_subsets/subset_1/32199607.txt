BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with increased all-cause mortality, 
smoking, and age-associated proteins, yet multiple previous studies found no 
association between SZ and biological age using Horvath's epigenetic clock, a 
well-established aging biomarker based on DNA methylation. However, numerous 
epigenetic clocks that may capture distinct aspects of aging have been 
developed. This study tested the hypothesis that altered aging in SZ manifests 
in these other clocks.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of 14 epigenetic clocks 
categorized according to what they were trained to predict: chronological age, 
mortality, mitotic divisions, or telomere length. To understand the etiology of 
biological age differences, we also examined DNA methylation predictors of 
smoking, alcohol, body mass index, serum proteins, and cell proportions. We 
independently analyzed 3 publicly available multiethnic DNA methylation data 
sets from whole blood, a total of 567 SZ cases and 594 nonpsychiatric controls.
RESULTS: All data sets showed accelerations in SZ for the 3 mortality clocks up 
to 5 years, driven by smoking and elevated levels of 6 age-associated proteins. 
The 2 mitotic clocks were decelerated in SZ related to antitumor natural killer 
and CD8T cells, which may help explain conflicting reports about low cancer 
rates in epidemiological studies of SZ. One cohort with available medication 
data showed that clozapine is associated with male-specific decelerations up to 
7 years in multiple chronological age clocks.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the utility of studying the various 
epigenetic clocks in tandem and highlights potential mechanisms by which mental 
illness influences long-term outcomes, including cancer and early mortality.
