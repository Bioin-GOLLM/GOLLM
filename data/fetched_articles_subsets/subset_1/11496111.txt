In the pore of homomeric cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, Ca(2+) and 
Mg(2+) bind to a set of glutamate residues, which in the bovine olfactory CNG 
channel are located at position 340. However, native CNG channels from olfactory 
sensory neurons are composed by the assembly of three different types of 
subunits, each having a different residue -- glutamate, aspartate or glycine -- 
at the position corresponding to the binding site for external Ca(2+) and 
Mg(2+). We co-expressed the wild-type principal alpha subunit with its mutants 
E340G and E340D in different combinations in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and 
measured Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) blockage in excised outside-out membrane patches. The 
comparison between our results and data from native olfactory CNG channels 
indicates that the presence of all three residues -- glutamate, aspartate and 
glycine -- in the different subunits, is necessary to restore the sensitivity to 
external Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) measured in native channels.
