Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common glioma variant in adults and is 
highly malignant. Tumors are thought to harbor a subpopulation of stem-like 
cancer cells, with the bulk resembling neural progenitor-like cells that are 
unable to fully differentiate. Although multiple pathways are known to be 
involved in glioma tumorigenesis, the role of Wnt signaling has been poorly 
described. Here, we show that Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2), a key component of the Wnt 
signaling pathway, is overexpressed in human gliomas. RNA interference-mediated 
depletion of Dvl2 blocked proliferation and promoted the differentiation of 
cultured human glioma cell lines and primary, patient-derived glioma cells. In 
addition, Dvl2 depletion inhibited tumor formation after intracranial injection 
of glioblastoma cells in immunodeficient mice. Inhibition of canonical 
Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling also blocked proliferation, but unlike Dvl2 depletion, 
did not induce differentiation. Finally, Wnt5a, a noncanonical Wnt ligand, was 
also required for glioma cell proliferation. The data therefore suggest that 
both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways downstream of Dvl2 
cooperate to maintain the proliferative capacity of human glioblastomas.
