Epidemiological studies have shown that traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases 
the risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). However, molecular 
mechanisms that underlie this risk are largely unidentified. TBI triggers 
widespread epigenetic modifications. Similarly, NDs such as Alzheimer's or 
Parkinson's are associated with numerous epigenetic changes. Although epigenetic 
changes can persist after TBI, it is unresolved if these modifications increase 
the risk of later ND development and/or dementia. We briefly review TBI-related 
epigenetic changes, and point out putative feedback loops that might contribute 
to long-term persistence of some modifications. We then focus on evidence 
suggesting persistent TBI-associated epigenetic changes may contribute to 
pathological processes (e.g., neuroinflammation) which may facilitate the 
development of specific NDs - Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or 
chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we discuss possible directions for 
TBI therapies that may help prevent or delay development of NDs.
