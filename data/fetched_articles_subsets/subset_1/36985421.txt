Recently, targeted nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted much attention in cancer 
treatment due to their high potential as carriers for drug delivery. In this 
article, we present a novel bioconjugate (DOX-AuNPs-Tmab) consisting of gold 
nanoparticles (AuNPs, 30 nm) attached to chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin 
(DOX) and a monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Tmab), which exhibited specific 
binding to HER2 receptors. The size and shape of synthesized AuNPs, as well as 
their surface modification, were analyzed by the TEM (transmission electron 
microscopy) and DLS (dynamic light scattering) methods. Biological studies were 
performed on the SKOV-3 cell line (HER2+) and showed high specificity of binding 
to the receptors and internalization capabilities, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells 
(HER2-) did not. Cytotoxicity experiments revealed a decrease in the metabolic 
activity of cancer cells and surface area reduction of spheroids treated with 
DOX-AuNPs-Tmab. The bioconjugate induced mainly cell cycle G2/M-phase arrest and 
late apoptosis. Our results suggest that DOX-AuNPs-Tmab has great potential for 
targeted therapy of HER2-positive tumors.
