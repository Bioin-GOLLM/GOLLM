Poxviruses have evolved a variety of innate immunity evasion mechanisms, some of 
which involve poxvirus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligases and adaptor proteins. Based 
on their functional domains and ubiquitin transfer mechanisms, these 
poxvirus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligases and adaptor proteins can be divided into 
five categories: PRANC, ANK/BC, BBK, P28/RING, and MARCH proteins. Although the 
substrates of many poxvirus E3 ubiquitin ligases remain to be discovered, most 
of the identified substrates are components of the innate immune system. In this 
review, we discuss the current research progress on poxvirus-encoded E3 
ubiquitin ligases and adaptor proteins to provide mechanistic insights into the 
interplay between these viruses and their hosts.
