Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting the immunophenotypic 
marker CD10+ (calla), usually has treatment profile good. The FLT3 molecular 
marker is listed as a prognostic factor, an important leukaemogenic marker in 
acute leukemias, also the polymorphism (G1082A) of the IL10 interleukin can to 
present pleiotropic effects in many diseases and could is associated to 
development of ALL. However, the FLT3 expression is variability among patients 
with calla-ALL. The aim of this study was to determine the FLT3 expression, to 
associate with the genotypes and allelic of G1082A (IL10) in 50 patients with 
calla-ALL and assess the overall survival at 98 months follow-up. The expression 
was assessed by quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR), the G1082A polymorphism was 
identified by allele-specific PCR and for immunophenotypic classification was 
used specific markers of B lineage-calla. We observed that patients who died 
showed higher FLT3 expression (p = 0.005), worse survival (p = 0.0137) and the 
IL10G allele may favor the survival, because the IL10 GG and IL10 GA genotypes 
showed a low FLT3 expression (p < 0.05).
