BACKGROUND: Non-cirrhotic intrahepatic portal hypertension (NCIPH) is 
characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy of the portal venous system, low 
ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 
motifs-13), and high vWF (von Willebrand factor) levels. This study aimed to 
screen for ADAMTS13 mutations, focusing on the CUB domain, in these patients.
METHODS: Prospectively recruited NCIPH patients and healthy volunteers underwent 
tests for plasma vWF-ADAMTS13 balance. Sanger sequencing of the CUB domain of 
ADAMTS13 was done in a subset of the NCIPH patients, and the detected mutation 
was screened for in all the study participants. Next-generation sequencing of 
clinically relevant exome and liver immunostaining for ADAMTS13 was done in 
patients with detected ADAMTS13 mutation.
RESULTS: Plasma vWF-ADAMTS13 balance was significantly altered in 24 NCIPH 
patients (Child's class A:23, B:1) as compared to 22 controls. On initial 
sequencing of the CUB domain (17 cases and 3 controls), one NCIPH patient showed 
a rare missense variant (SNV) at position c.3829CÂ >T resulting in p.R1277W 
(rs14045669). Subsequent RFLP analysis targeted to the R1277W variant did not 
detect this in any other NCIPH patient, nor in any of the 22 controls. The NCIPH 
patient with the R1277W variant had severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, consistently 
high vWF, other missense SNVs in ADAMTS13, vWF, and complement genes. 
Immunostaining of his liver biopsy revealed globules of ADAMTS13 within stellate 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We report missense variants in ADAMTS13, vWF, and complement genes 
in a patient with NCIPH who had decreased secretion and activity of ADAMTS13 
protein. Further studies are needed in NCIPH patients in this regard.
