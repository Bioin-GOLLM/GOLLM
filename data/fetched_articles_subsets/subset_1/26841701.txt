Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a messenger RNA quality-control pathway 
triggered by SMG1-mediated phosphorylation of the NMD factor UPF1. In recent 
times, the RNA helicase DHX34 was found to promote mRNP remodelling, leading to 
activation of NMD. Here we demonstrate the mechanism by which DHX34 functions in 
concert with SMG1. DHX34 comprises two distinct structural units, a core that 
binds UPF1 and a protruding carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) that binds the SMG1 
kinase, as shown using truncated forms of DHX34 and electron microscopy of the 
SMG1-DHX34 complex. Truncation of the DHX34 CTD does not affect binding to UPF1; 
however, it compromises DHX34 binding to SMG1 to affect UPF1 phosphorylation and 
hence abrogate NMD. Altogether, these data suggest the existence of a complex 
comprising SMG1, UPF1 and DHX34, with DHX34 functioning as a scaffold for UPF1 
and SMG1. This complex promotes UPF1 phosphorylation leading to functional NMD.
