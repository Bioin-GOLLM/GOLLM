In the context of myocardial infarction, the burst of superoxide generated by 
reverse electron transport (RET) at complex I in mitochondria is a crucial 
trigger for damage during ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here we outline 
the necessary conditions for superoxide production by RET at complex I and how 
it can occur during reperfusion. In addition, we explore various pathways that 
are implicated in generating the conditions for RET to occur and suggest 
potential therapeutic strategies to target RET, aiming to achieve 
cardioprotection.
