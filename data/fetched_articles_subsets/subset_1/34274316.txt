B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor possessing a 
BTB-POZ (BR-C, ttk, and bab for BTB; pox virus and zinc finger for POZ) domain, 
which is required for homodimerization and association with corepressors. BCL6 
has multiple roles in normal immunity, autoimmunity, and some types of lymphoma. 
Mice bearing disrupted BCL6 loci demonstrate suppressed high-affinity antibody 
responses to T-dependent antigens. The corepressor binding groove in the BTB-POZ 
domain is a potential target for small compound-mediated therapy. Several 
inhibitors targeting this binding groove have been described, but these 
compounds have limited or absent in vivo activity. Biophysical studies of a 
novel compound, GSK137, showed an in vitro pIC50 of 8 and a cellular pIC50 of 
7.3 for blocking binding of a peptide derived from the corepressor silencing 
mediator for retinoid or thyroid hormone receptors to the BCL6 BTB-POZ domain. 
The compound has good solubility (128 μg/ml) and permeability (86 nM/s). GSK137 
caused little change in cell viability or proliferation in four BCL6-expressing 
B-cell lymphoma lines, although there was modest dose-dependent accumulation of 
G1 phase cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice showed a profile compatible with 
achieving good levels of target engagement. GSK137, administered orally, 
suppressed immunoglobulin G responses and reduced numbers of germinal centers 
and germinal center B cells following immunization of mice with the hapten 
trinitrophenol. Overall, we report a novel small-molecule BCL6 inhibitor with 
in vivo activity that inhibits the T-dependent antigen immune response.
