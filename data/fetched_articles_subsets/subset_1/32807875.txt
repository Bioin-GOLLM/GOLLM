Polo like kinase 4 (Plk4) is a tightly regulated serine threonine kinase that 
governs centriole duplication. Increased Plk4 expression, which is a feature of 
many common human cancers, causes centriole overduplication, mitotic 
irregularities, and chromosomal instability. Plk4 can also promote cancer 
invasion and metastasis through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Herein we 
demonstrate physical interaction of Plk4 with FAM46C/TENT5C, a conserved protein 
of unknown function until recently. FAM46C localizes to centrioles, inhibits 
Plk4 kinase activity, and suppresses Plk4-induced centriole duplication. 
Interference with Plk4 function by FAM46C was independent of the latter's 
nucleotidyl transferase activity. In addition, FAM46C restrained cancer cell 
invasion and suppressed MDA MB-435 cancer growth in a xenograft model, opposing 
the effect of Plk4. We demonstrate loss of FAM46C in patient-derived colorectal 
cancer tumor tissue that becomes more profound with advanced clinical stage. 
These results implicate FAM46C as a tumor suppressor that acts by inhibiting 
Plk4 activity.
