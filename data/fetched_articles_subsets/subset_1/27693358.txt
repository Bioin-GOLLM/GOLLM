Mitochondrial ribosomes translate membrane integral core subunits of the 
oxidative phosphorylation system encoded by mtDNA. These translation products 
associate with nuclear-encoded, imported proteins to form enzyme complexes that 
produce ATP. Here, we show that human mitochondrial ribosomes display 
translational plasticity to cope with the supply of imported nuclear-encoded 
subunits. Ribosomes expressing mitochondrial-encoded COX1 mRNA selectively 
engage with cytochrome c oxidase assembly factors in the inner membrane. 
Assembly defects of the cytochrome c oxidase arrest mitochondrial translation in 
a ribosome nascent chain complex with a partially membrane-inserted COX1 
translation product. This complex represents a primed state of the translation 
product that can be retrieved for assembly. These findings establish a mammalian 
translational plasticity pathway in mitochondria that enables adaptation of 
mitochondrial protein synthesis to the influx of nuclear-encoded subunits.
