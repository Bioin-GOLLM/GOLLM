In addition to protein-coding genes, the human genome makes a large amount of 
noncoding RNAs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been described as the 
largest subclass of the non-coding transcriptome in human noncoding RNAs. In 
recent years, lncRNAs have been considered to be the key regulators of tumor 
behavior. In this study, based on previous research, we investigated the 
expression and biological role of a newly identified cancer-related lncRNA, 
lncRNA-uc002kmd.1. We analyzed the relationship between lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 and 
colorectal cancer (CRC) in a total 45 CRC and paired adjacent, non-tumor tissue 
samples. We found that lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 expression was usually highly expressed 
in carcinoma compared with the tissue adjacent to the carcinoma. Through a 
series of experiments, the results showed that lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 regulates CD44 
as a molecular decoy for miR211-3p. Our data indicated that the overexpression 
of lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 enhanced cell proliferation in CRC.
