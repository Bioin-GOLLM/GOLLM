PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in levels of adrenergic 
receptor β3 (ADRB3), Rho-related kinase 2 (ROCK2), and guanine nucleotide 
exchange factor (GEF), which play key roles in the adrenergic and cholinergic 
pathways of contraction-relaxation harmony in voiding physiology, and to explore 
the relationship between these proteins and overactive bladder (OAB).
METHODS: This study included 60 idiopathic OAB patients and a healthy control 
group. A validated OAB-validated 8 questionnaire was completed by all 
participants. Serum levels of ADRB3, ROCK2, and GEF were examined with 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Patient and control groups were compared in 
terms of these levels, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 
generated for all parameters.
RESULTS: The levels of ROCK2 were significantly elevated, but there were no 
correlations between the OAB symptom score and the serum levels of ROCK2, ADRB3, 
and GEF in OAB patients. In the ROC analysis, ROCK2 alone provided the strongest 
potential relationship (area under the curve=0.651) with 84.9% sensitivity. The 
ROCK2+GEF combination provided a satisfactory relationship (AUC=0.755). The AUC 
for the ADRB3+ROCK2+GEF combination was 0.752, with 64.2% sensitivity and 88.2% 
specificity.
CONCLUSION: The study results suggest that alterations in serum ROCK2 levels and 
the use of this parameter in combination with ADRB3 and GEF levels can shed 
light on the pathophysiology of idiopathic OAB syndrome and provide a new 
perspective for treatment.
