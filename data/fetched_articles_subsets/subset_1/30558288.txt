Cellular senescence displays a heterogeneous set of phenotypes linked to tumor 
suppression; however, after drug treatment, senescence may also be involved in 
stable or recurrent cancer. Metabolic changes during senescence can provide 
detailed information on cellular status and may also have implications for the 
development of effective treatment strategies. The metabolic response to 
Adriamycin (ADR) treatment, which causes senescence as well as cell death, was 
obtained with the aid of metabolic profiling and isotope tracing in two human 
breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. After 5 days of ADR treatment, 
more than 60% of remaining, intact cells entered into a senescent state, 
characterized by enlarged and flattened morphology and positive blue staining 
using SA-Î²-gal. Metabolic trajectory analysis showed that the two cell lines' 
responses were significantly different and were divided into two distinct 
stages. The metabolic shift from the first stage to the second was reflected by 
a partial recovery of the TCA cycle, as well as amino acid and lipid 
metabolisms. Isotope tracing analysis indicated that the higher level of 
glutamine metabolism helped maintain senescence. The results suggest that the 
dynamic changes during senescence indicate a multi-step process involving 
important metabolic pathways which might allow breast cancer cells to adapt to 
persistent ADR treatment, while the higher level of anapleurosis may be 
important for maintaining the senescent state. Ultimately, a better 
understanding of metabolic changes during senescence might provide targets for 
cancer therapy and tumor eradication.
