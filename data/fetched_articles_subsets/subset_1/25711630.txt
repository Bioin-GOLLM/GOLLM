Development of malignancies in BRCA1 germ-line mutation carriers usually 
involves somatic inactivation of the remaining BRCA1 allele. This feature leads 
to a tumor-specific deficiency of double-strand DNA break repair and underlies 
pronounced sensitivity of BRCA1-driven cancers to cisplatin. BRCA1-specific 
activity of cisplatin has been repeatedly demonstrated in cell culture and 
animal experiments; however, corresponding clinical evidence remains limited. We 
applied neoadjuvant monotherapy by cisplatin (75-100Â mg/m(2), 4-6 cycles) to six 
breast cancer patients carrying BRCA1 5382insC mutation. Pronounced reduction in 
tumor size was observed in all treated women. Three patients (T2N0M0, T4N2M0 and 
T4N2M0) showed pathologic complete response, two women (T4N0M0 and T2N1M0) had 
partial pathologic response, and one woman (T3N2M0) declined surgery. This study 
and available literature data suggest that cisplatin is a preferable option for 
systemic treatment of BRCA1-related hereditary breast cancer.
