Detection of an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in circulating 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a noninvasive method to collect genetic information to 
guide treatment of lung cancer with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, 
the association between cfDNA and detection of EGFR mutations in tumor tissue 
remains unclear. Here, a meta-analysis was performed to determine whether cfDNA 
could serve as a substitute for tissue specimens for the detection of EGFR 
mutations. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and areas under the curve of 
cfDNA were 0.60, 0.94, and 0.9208 for the detection of EGFR mutations, 0.64, 
0.99, and 0.9583 for detection of the exon 19 deletion, and 0.57, 0.99, and 
0.9605 for the detection of the L858R mutation, respectively. Our results showed 
that cfDNA has a high degree of specificity to detect exon 19 deletions and 
L858R mutation. Due to its high specificity and noninvasive characteristics, 
cfDNA analysis presents a promising method to screen for mutations in NSCLC and 
predict patient response to EGFR-TKI treatment, dynamically assess treatment 
outcome, and facilitate early detection of resistance mutations.
