Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by multiple 
lesions in the brain and spinal cord. We used RNA sequencing to identify 
microbial sequences and characterize human gene expression patterns in 30 human 
brain biopsy specimens. RNAs which aligned to known microbial taxa, were 
significantly enriched in 10 of 12 primary demyelination (MS) brain specimens 
compared to a group of 15 epilepsy controls, leading to a list of 29 MS 
microbial candidate genera from 11 different phyla. Most of the candidate MS 
microbes are anaerobic bacteria. While there were some shared candidates, each 
of the 10 MS samples with significant microbial RNA enrichment had a distinct 
set microbial candidates. The fraction of microbial sequencing reads was greater 
for the MS group (128.8 PPM) compared to the controls (77.4 PPM, p = 0.016). 
Bacterial peptidoglycan was demonstrated in brain tissue sections from several 
MS subjects. Human gene expression analysis showed increased expression of 
inflammation-related pathways in the MS group. This data shows that 
demyelinating brain lesions are associated with the presence of microbial RNA 
sequences and bacterial antigen. This suggests that MS is triggered by the 
presence of a diverse set of microbes within a lesion.
