It has been suggested that hepatobiliary carcinomas are less frequent in 
Wilson's disease (WD) than in liver diseases of other etiology. However, the 
protective role of copper against malignancies is debated. Only a few cases of 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) in WD have been published. Here we report on a case of 
a 47-year-old male H1069Q homozygous, Kayser-Fleischer ring positive WD patient 
with a low ceruloplasmin level who was followed up and treated with chelating 
agents throughout nine years. The patient presented with neurological symptoms 
and liver cirrhosis at diagnosis. Clinical symptoms regressed after the 
treatment initiation. Rapidly developed tumour metastases were found in the 
bones, lung and liver (without jaundice). Autopsy revealed cholangiocarcinoma as 
the primary tumour confirmed by strong CK7 positivity and glypican-3 negativity. 
The curiosity of the presented case is the very rapid development of CCC despite 
continuous chelating agent therapy.
