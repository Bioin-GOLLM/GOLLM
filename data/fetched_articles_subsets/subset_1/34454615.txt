Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), 
Alzheimer's disease with amygdala restricted Lewy bodies (AD/ALB), and multiple 
system atrophy (MSA) comprise a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders 
characterized by the presence of distinct pathological α-synuclein (αSyn) 
inclusions. Experimental and pathological studies support the notion that αSyn 
aggregates contribute to cellular demise and dysfunction with disease 
progression associated with a prion-like spread of αSyn aggregates via 
conformational templating. The initiating event(s) and factors that contribute 
to diverse forms of synucleinopathies remain poorly understood. A major 
post-translational modification of αSyn associated with pathological inclusions 
is a diverse array of specific truncations within the carboxy terminal region. 
While these modifications have been shown experimentally to induce and promote 
αSyn aggregation, little is known about their disease-, region- and cell type 
specific distribution. To this end, we generated a series of monoclonal 
antibodies specific to neo-epitopes in αSyn truncated after residues 103, 115, 
119, 122, 125, and 129. Immunocytochemical investigations using these new tools 
revealed striking differences in the αSyn truncation pattern between different 
synucleinopathies, brain regions and specific cellular populations. In LBD, 
neuronal inclusions in the substantia nigra and amygdala were positive for αSyn 
cleaved after residues 103, 119, 122, and 125, but not 115. In contrast, in the 
same patients' brain αSyn cleaved at residue 115, as well as 103, 119 and 122 
were abundant in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. In patients with AD/ALB, 
these modifications were only weakly or not detected in amygdala αSyn 
inclusions. αSyn truncated at residues 103, 115, 119, and 125 was readily 
present in MSA glial cytoplasmic inclusions, but 122 cleaved αSyn was only 
weakly or not present. Conversely, MSA neuronal pathology in the pontine nuclei 
was strongly reactive to the αSyn x-122 neo-epitope but did not display any 
reactivity for αSyn 103 cleavage. These studies demonstrate significant 
disease-, region- and cell type specific differences in carboxy terminal αSyn 
processing associated with pathological inclusions that likely contributes to 
their distinct strain-like prion properties and promotes the diversity displayed 
in the degrees of these insidious diseases.
