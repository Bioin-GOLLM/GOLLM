Copper serves as a co-factor for a host of metalloenzymes that contribute to 
malignant progression. The orally bioavailable copper chelating agent 
tetrathiomolybdate (TM) has been associated with a significant survival benefit 
in high-risk triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Despite these 
promising data, the mechanisms by which copper depletion impacts metastasis are 
poorly understood and this remains a major barrier to advancing TM to a 
randomized phase II trial. Here, using two independent TNBC models, we report a 
discrete subpopulation of highly metastatic SOX2/OCT4+ cells within primary 
tumors that exhibit elevated intracellular copper levels and a marked 
sensitivity to TM. Global proteomic and metabolomic profiling identifies 
TM-mediated inactivation of Complex IV as the primary metabolic defect in the 
SOX2/OCT4+ cell population. We also identify AMPK/mTORC1 energy sensor as an 
important downstream pathway and show that AMPK inhibition rescues TM-mediated 
loss of invasion. Furthermore, loss of the mitochondria-specific copper 
chaperone, COX17, restricts copper deficiency to mitochondria and phenocopies 
TM-mediated alterations. These findings identify a copper-metabolism-metastasis 
axis with potential to enrich patient populations in next-generation therapeutic 
trials.
