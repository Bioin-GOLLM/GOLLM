Tau is a microtubule associated protein that is localized to the axon in 
neurons. During pathological conditions, including frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD), a shift in tau isoforms occurs that leads to enhanced expression of a 
form of tau with four (rather than three) microtubule binding repeats; this has 
been postulated to alter microtubule structure. Second harmonic generation (SHG) 
is a technique that allows the visualization of intact microtubules in axons of 
living neurons without the need for labeling or fixing. We examined how the 
presence of exogenous tau influences SHG in living neurons. Our results show 
that the presence of tau significantly enhances SHG, specifically in neuronal 
axons, despite the presence of tau throughout the entire cell. Our data also 
suggest that the presence or absence of the fourth microtubule binding repeat 
does not significantly alter tau's ability to enhance SHG. These results provide 
evidence that SHG is a useful, noninvasive tool to study tau-microtubule 
interactions in axons; further, it appears that tau overexpression, rather than 
specific isoforms, is the major contributor to tau-induced changes in axonal 
microtubule SHG signal.
