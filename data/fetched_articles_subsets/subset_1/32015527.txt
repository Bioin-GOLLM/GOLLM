Cancer genomes contain large numbers of somatic mutations but few of these 
mutations drive tumor development. Current approaches either identify driver 
genes on the basis of mutational recurrence or approximate the functional 
consequences of nonsynonymous mutations by using bioinformatic scores. Passenger 
mutations are enriched in characteristic nucleotide contexts, whereas driver 
mutations occur in functional positions, which are not necessarily surrounded by 
a particular nucleotide context. We observed that mutations in contexts that 
deviate from the characteristic contexts around passenger mutations provide a 
signal in favor of driver genes. We therefore developed a method that combines 
this feature with the signals traditionally used for driver-gene identification. 
We applied our method to whole-exome sequencing data from 11,873 tumor-normal 
pairs and identified 460 driver genes that clustered into 21 cancer-related 
pathways. Our study provides a resource of driver genes across 28 tumor types 
with additional driver genes identified according to mutations in unusual 
nucleotide contexts.
