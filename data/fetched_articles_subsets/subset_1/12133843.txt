To begin the physical characterization of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2A, 
a translation initiation factor that binds Met-tRNA(i), tryptic peptides from 
rabbit reticulocyte eIF2A were analyzed to obtain amino acid sequence 
information. Sequences for 8 peptides were matched to three different expressed 
sequence tag clones. The sequence predicted for eIF2A is 585 amino acids. 
Matching of the cDNA sequence to the human genome revealed that the eIF2A mRNA 
is made up of 15 or 16 exons, and the gene is contained on chromosome 3. A 
homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was identified, YGR054W, which is a 
non-essential gene. Hemagglutinin-tagged yeast eIF2A localizes on both 40 S and 
80 S ribosomes. A knockout of both eIF2A and eIF5B yielded a "synthetically 
sick" yeast strain with a severe slow growth phenotype. The phenotype of this 
double mutant and the biochemical localization suggest that eIF2A participates 
in translation initiation. eIF2A does not appear to participate in re-initiation 
as the DeltaeIF2A strain shows the same level of GCN4 induction with amino acid 
starvation as seen in wild type yeast. The lack of any apparent phenotype in the 
DeltaeIF2A strain suggests that eIF2A functions in a minor pathway, perhaps 
internal initiation or in the translation of a small number of specific mRNAs.
