Bariatric surgery leads to sustained weight loss and the resolution of 
obesity-related comorbidities. Recent studies have suggested that changes in gut 
microbiota are associated with the weight loss induced by bariatric surgery. 
Several studies have observed major changes in the microbial composition 
following gastric bypass surgery. However, there are inconsistencies between the 
reported alterations in microbial compositions in different studies. 
Furthermore, it is well established that diet is an important factor shaping the 
composition and function of intestinal microbiota. However, most studies on 
gastric bypass have not assessed the impact of dietary intake on the microbiome 
composition in general, let alone the impact of restrictive diets prior to 
bariatric surgery, which are recommended for reducing liver fat content and 
size. Thus, the relative impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss and gut 
microbiota remains unclear. Therefore, this review aims to provide a deeper 
understanding of the current knowledge of the changes in intestinal microbiota 
induced by bariatric surgery considering pre-surgical nutritional changes.
