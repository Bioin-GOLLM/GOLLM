The coding-complete genomes of laboratory vaccinia virus strain Copenhagen and 
the Copenhagen-derived deletion strain, vP811, were determined by short-read 
sequencing. Relative to the NCBI reference genome M35027, seven common coding 
differences were revealed, including an intact copy of the vaccinia virus 
immunomodulator A46R in both Cop and vP811.
