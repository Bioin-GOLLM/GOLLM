Two patients in a consanguineous Indian family with infantile glycogenosis type 
II were found to have a G to A transition in exon 11 of the human lysosomal 
alpha-glucosidase gene. Both patients were homozygous and both parents were 
heterozygous for the mutant allele. The mutation causes a Glu to Lys 
substitution at amino acid position 521, just three amino acids downstream from 
the catalytic site at Asp-518. The mutation was introduced in wild type 
lysosomal alpha-glucosidase cDNA and the mutant construct was expressed in vitro 
and in vivo. The Glu to Lys substitution is proven to account for the abnormal 
physical properties of the patients lysosomal alpha-glucosidase precursor and to 
prevent the formation of catalytically active enzyme. In homozygous form it 
leads to the severe infantile phenotype of glycogenosis type II.
