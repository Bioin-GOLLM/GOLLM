Abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, heat, and heavy metals, 
extensively reducing global agricultural production. Traditional breeding 
approaches and transgenic technology have been widely used to mitigate the risks 
of these environmental stresses. The discovery of engineered nucleases as 
genetic scissors to carry out precise manipulation in crop stress-responsive 
genes and associated molecular network has paved the way for sustainable 
management of abiotic stress conditions. In this context, the clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas (CRISPR/Cas)-based 
gene-editing tool has revolutionized due to its simplicity, accessibility, 
adaptability, flexibility, and wide applicability. This system has great 
potential to build up crop varieties with enhanced tolerance against abiotic 
stresses. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on understanding the 
mechanism of abiotic stress response in plants and the application of 
CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene-editing system towards enhanced tolerance to a 
multitude of stresses including drought, salinity, cold, heat, and heavy metals. 
We provide mechanistic insights on the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing 
technology. We also discuss applications of evolving genome editing techniques 
such as prime editing and base editing, mutant library production, transgene 
free and multiplexing to rapidly deliver modern crop cultivars adapted to 
abiotic stress conditions.
