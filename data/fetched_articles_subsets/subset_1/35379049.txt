Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the association between vitamin D 
receptor (an essential component in the vitamin D signaling pathway) and serum 
vitamin D as well as its clinical significance in papillary thyroid cancer. 
Methods: This prospective cohort study comprised patients with thyroid tumors 
who visited our hospital, from 2017 to 2018. The level of vitamin D receptor 
expression from thyroid tissue was measured in patients with thyroid tumor and 
evaluated for correlation with serum vitamin D levels and clinicopathologic 
characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer. Data from 501 patients with 
papillary thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were analyzed. 
Results: Increased vitamin D receptor protein and mRNA expression were observed 
in papillary thyroid cancer compared to those in normal and benign tissues. 
Lower vitamin D receptor protein expression was associated with high TNM stage 
papillary thyroid cancer and low p21 protein expression. Lower relative vitamin 
D receptor mRNA expression in papillary thyroid cancer was associated with low 
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The Cancer Genome Atlas database showed a 
positive correlation among mRNA expression of vitamin D receptor, CYP24A1, and 
p21. Conclusions: An association between decreased vitamin D receptor protein 
expression and advanced stage papillary thyroid cancer, and a correlation 
between low vitamin D receptor mRNA expression with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
D level was observed. Low vitamin D receptor expression in papillary thyroid 
cancer was shown to positively correlate with low serum vitamin D level and 
disease aggressiveness.
