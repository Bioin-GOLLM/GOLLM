The discovery of juvenile hormones (JH) and their synthetic analogs (JHA) 
generated excitement and hope that these compounds will replace first- and 
second-generation insecticides that have not so desirable environmental and 
human safety profiles. However, JHAs used commercially during the past four 
decades did not meet these expectations. The recent availability of advanced 
molecular and histological methods and the discovery of key players involved in 
JH action provided some insights into the functioning of JHA in a stage and 
species-specific manner. In this review, we will summarize recent findings and 
stage-specific action of JHA, focusing on three commercially used JHA, 
methoprene, hydroprene and pyriproxyfen and economically important pests, the 
red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the tobacco budworm, Heliothis 
virescens, and disease vector, the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.
