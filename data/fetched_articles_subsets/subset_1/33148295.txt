Gynecological cancers are among the leading causes of cancer-associated 
mortality worldwide. While the number of cases are rising, current therapeutic 
approaches are not efficient enough. There are considerable side-effects as well 
as treatment resistant types. In addition, which all make the treatment 
complicated for afflicted cases. Therefore, in order to improve efficacy of the 
treatment process and patients' quality of life, searching for novel adjuvant 
treatments is highly warranted. Curcumin, a promising natural compound, is 
endowed with numerous therapeutic potentials including significant anticancer 
effects. Recently, various investigations have demonstrated the anticancer 
effects of curcumin and its novel analogues on gynecological cancers. Moreover, 
novel formulations of curcumin have resulted in further propitious effects. This 
review discusses these studies and highlights the possible underlying mechanisms 
of the observed effects.
