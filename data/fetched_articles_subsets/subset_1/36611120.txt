SOLAR-1 and BYLieve trials documented the efficacy of the PI3K-inhibitor 
alpelisib in pre-treated PIK3CA-mutant, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative 
(HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) patients. We report here real-life data 
of patients prospectively registered in the French alpelisib early access 
program (EAP) opened to PIK3CA-mutant HR+/HER2- ABC patients treated with 
alpelisib and fulvestrant. Primary endpoint was PFS by local investigators using 
RECIST1.1. Eleven centers provided individual data on 233 consecutive patients. 
Patients had received a median number of 4 (range: 1-16) prior systemic 
treatments for ABC, including CDK4/6 inhibitor, chemotherapy, fulvestrant and 
everolimus in 227 (97.4%), 180 (77.3%), 175 (75.1%) and 131 (56.2%) patients, 
respectively. After a median follow-up of 7.1 months and 168 events, median PFS 
was 5.3 months (95% CI: 4.7-6.0). Among 186 evaluable patients, CBR at 6 months 
was 45.3% (95% CI: 37.8-52.8). In multivariable analysis, characteristics 
significantly associated with a shorter PFS were age < 60 years (HR = 1.5, 95% 
CI = 1.1-2.1), >5 lines of prior treatments (HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-2.0) and the 
C420R PI3KCA mutation (HR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.3-13.6). N = 91 (39.1%) patients 
discontinued alpelisib due to adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the 
largest real-life assessment of alpelisib efficacy. Despite heavy 
pre-treatments, patients derived a clinically relevant benefit from alpelisib 
and fulvestrant.
