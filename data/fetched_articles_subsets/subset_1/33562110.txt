Isoquinoline alkaloids-enriched herbal plants have been used as traditional folk 
medicine for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and analgesic effects. They 
induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy, leading to cell death. While 
the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood, it has been 
suggested that binding to nucleic acids or proteins, enzyme inhibition, and 
epigenetic modulation by isoquinoline alkaloids may play a role in the effects. 
This review discusses recent evidence on the molecular mechanisms by which the 
isoquinoline alkaloids can be a therapeutic target of cancer treatment.
