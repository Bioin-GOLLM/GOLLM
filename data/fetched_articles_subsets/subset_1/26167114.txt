PURPOSE: Albinism is a heterogeneous genetic disorder of melanin synthesis that 
results in hypopigmented eyes (in patients with ocular albinism) or hair, skin, 
and eyes (in individuals with oculocutaneous albinism). It is associated with 
decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, and photophobia. The tyrosinase 
gene is known to be involved in both oculocutaneous albinism and autosomal 
recessive ocular albinism. In this study, we aimed to screen the mutations in 
the TYR gene in the nonsyndromic OCA and autosomal recessive ocular albinism 
patients from Iran.
METHODS: The tyrosinase gene was examined in 23 unrelated patients with 
autosomal recessive ocular albinism or nonsyndromic OCA using DNA sequencing and 
bioinformatics analysis.
RESULTS: TYR gene mutations were identiÔ¨Åed in 14 (app. 60%) albinism patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We found 10 mutations, 3 of which were novel. No mutation was found 
in our ocular albinism patients, but one of them was heterozygous for the 
p.R402Q polymorphism.
