BACKGROUND: A mannitol stress treatment and a subsequent application of 
n-butanol, known as a microtubule-disrupting agent, enhance microspore 
embryogenesis (ME) induction and plant regeneration in bread wheat. To 
characterize changes in cortical (CMT) and endoplasmic (EMT) microtubules 
organization and dynamics, associated with ME induction treatments, 
immunocytochemistry studies complemented by confocal laser scanning microscopy 
(CLSM) were accomplished. This technique has allowed us to perform advanced 3- 
and 4D studies of MT architecture. The degree of MT fragmentation was examined 
by the relative fluorescence intensity quantification.
RESULTS: In uni-nucleated mannitol-treated microspores, severe CMT and EMT 
fragmentation occurs, although a complex network of short EMT bundles protected 
the nucleus. Additional treatment with n-butanol resulted in further 
depolymerization of both CMT and EMT, simultaneously with the formation of MT 
aggregates in the perinuclear region. Some aggregates resembled a preprophase 
band. In addition, a portion of the microspores progressed to the first mitotic 
division during the treatments. Bi-nucleate pollen-like structures showed a high 
MT depolymerization after mannitol treatment and numerous EMT bundles around the 
vegetative and generative nuclei after n-butanol. Interestingly, bi-nucleate 
symmetric structures showed prominent stabilization of EMT.
CONCLUSIONS: Fragmentation and stabilization of microtubules induced by 
mannitol- and n-butanol lead to new configurations essential for the induction 
of microspore embryogenesis in bread wheat. These results provide robust insight 
into MT dynamics during EM induction and open avenues to address newly targeted 
treatments to induce ME in recalcitrant species.
