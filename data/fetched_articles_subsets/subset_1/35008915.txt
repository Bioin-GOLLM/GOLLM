Understanding the mechanisms of resistance to therapy in human cancer cells has 
become a multifaceted limiting factor to achieving optimal cures in cancer 
patients. Besides genetic and epigenetic alterations, enhanced DNA damage repair 
activity, deregulation of cell death, overexpression of transmembrane 
transporters, and complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment, other 
mechanisms of cancer treatment resistance have been recently proposed. In this 
review, we will summarize the preclinical and clinical studies highlighting the 
critical role of the microbiome in the efficacy of cancer treatment, concerning 
mainly chemotherapy and immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In 
addition to involvement in drug metabolism and immune surveillance, the 
production of microbiota-derived metabolites might represent the link between 
gut/intratumoral bacteria and response to anticancer therapies. Importantly, an 
emerging trend of using microbiota modulation by probiotics and fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) to overcome cancer treatment resistance will be also 
discussed.
