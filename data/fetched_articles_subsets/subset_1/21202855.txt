The title compound, C(15)H(10)ClF(3)N(2)O(3), is considered to belong to a 
fourth generation of insecticides with properties such as high selectivity, low 
acute toxicity for mammals and high biological activity. The dihedral angle 
between the two benzene rings is 59.3 (2)°. Intra-molecular C-H⋯O and N-H⋯O 
hydrogen bonds are observed. Inter-molecular N-H⋯O hydrogen bonding generates a 
centrosymmetric dimer. The F atoms are disordered over two positions; the site 
occupancy factors are 0.52 and 0.48.
