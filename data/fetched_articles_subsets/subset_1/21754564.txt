In the title compound, C(14)H(16)ClNO, the dihedral angle between the benzene 
ring and the conjugated part of the cyclo-hexene ring is 61.7 (2)°. Part of the 
cyclo-hexene ring and one of the attached methyl groups are disordered over two 
orientations with occupancies of 0.602 (7) and 0.398 (7). In addition, the 
crystal studied was a racemic twin [Flack parameter = 0.58 (4)]. In the crystal, 
the mol-ecules are linked into chains in the b-axis direction by inter-molecular 
N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. C-H⋯O and C-H⋯Cl inter-actions are also observed.
