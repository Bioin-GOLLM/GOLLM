The arsenal against different types of cancers has increased impressively in the 
last decade. The detailed knowledge of the tumor microenvironment enables it to 
be manipulated in order to help the immune system fight against tumor cells by 
using specific checkpoint inhibitors, cell-based treatments, targeted 
antibodies, and immune stimulants. In fact, it is widely known that the first 
immunotherapeutic tools as immune stimulants for cancer treatment were bacteria 
and still are; specifically, the use of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) continues to be the treatment of choice for preventing 
cancer recurrence and progression in non-invasive bladder cancer. BCG and also 
other mycobacteria or their components are currently under study for the 
immunotherapeutic treatment of different malignancies. This review focuses on 
the preclinical and clinical assays using mycobacteria to treat non-urological 
cancers, providing a wide knowledge of the beneficial applications of these 
microorganisms to manipulate the tumor microenvironment aiming at tumor 
clearance.
