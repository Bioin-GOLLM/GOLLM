Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) exhibit higher suicide rates than the general 
population. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the high rate of 
suicidal behavior in SCZ remains poorly understood. MTHFR Ala222Val (C677T; rs 
1801133) polymorphism has repeatedly demonstrated to play a pathological role in 
numerous mental disorders, but none of these studies focused on the 
susceptibility of suicidal behavior in SCZ. In the present cross-sectional 
study, we recruited 957 chronic inpatients with SCZ and 576 healthy controls to 
assess the psychopathological symptoms of SCZ and compare the frequency of the 
MTHFR Ala222Val genotype in both suicide attempters and non-attempters. Our 
results demonstrated no significant differences in MTHFR Ala222Val genotype and 
allele distributions between the SCZ patients and controls (p > 0.05), but 
showed a statistical significance in the distribution of Ala/Val genotype 
between suicide attempters and non-attempters (p < 0.05). Further logistic 
regression analysis showed that MTHFR Ala222Val genotype, psychopathological 
symptoms, number of cigarettes smoked per day and drinking status were related 
to suicide attempts in SCZ (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that MTHFR 
Ala222Val polymorphism and some clinical characteristics might confer 
susceptibility to suicide in patients with SCZ.
