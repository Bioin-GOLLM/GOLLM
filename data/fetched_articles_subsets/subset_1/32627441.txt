BACKGROUND: Spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model is one of the representative 
models of the neuropathic pain model. Neuropathic pain in a chronic 
post-ischemic pain (CPIP) mimics the symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome 
(CRPS). The administration of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), which has 
regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects, has been studied and is used in 
clinical practice treating various diseases. However, the analgesic effect of 
PDRN in a neuropathic pain or CRPS model remains unknown.
METHODS: PDRN (3.3, 10, and 20 mg/kg) was administered into the subcutaneous 
(SC) layer of the hind paws of SNL and CPIP models. Mechanical anti-allodynic 
effects were then investigated using the von Frey test. In the 
immunohistochemical examination, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the spinal cord 
were harvested and examined for the expression of glial fibrillary acidic 
protein (GFAP) after the 20 mg PDRN injection.
RESULTS: Mechanical allodynia was significantly alleviated by administration of 
PDRN in SNL and CPIP mice at all of the time point. As the dose of PDRN 
increased, the effect was greater. The 20 mg PDRN injection was found to have 
the most effective anti-allodynic effect. The increased expression of GFAP in 
DRG and the spinal cord of SNL and CPIP model decreased following the 
administration of PDRN than vehicle.
CONCLUSION: SC administration of PDRN results in the attenuation of allodynia 
and activation of astrocytes in neuropathic pain or CRPS models. We propose that 
PDRN can have significant potential advantages in neuropathic pain treatment.
