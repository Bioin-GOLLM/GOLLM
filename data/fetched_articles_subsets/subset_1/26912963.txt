Objective. The rural Central Gippsland Health Service (CGHS) assists patients 
with diabetes through the provision of diabetes education. The purpose of this 
study was to compare and evaluate the CGHS 5-week didactic program and a 
modified group-participatory Conversation Maps diabetes education program. 
Method. A pre- and post-program survey was conducted of clients who attended the 
two different diabetes education programs. The survey consisted of a 
self-constructed demographic questionnaire, the Diabetes Knowledge Test, the 
Diabetes Empowerment Scale, and the Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure. 
Results. For the CGHS program, there were no differences between pre- and 
post-program surveys in knowledge scores (11.05 ± 3.56 vs. 12.75 ± 4.19, P = 
0.0883, n = 20), self-care activities (4.46 ± 1.11 vs. 4.83 ± 0.68, P = 0.0832, 
n = 12), or empowerment scores (7.16 ± 1.60 vs. 7.92 ± 1.26, P = 0.0540, n = 
17). For the modified Conversation Maps program, there were significant 
improvements between pre- and post-program surveys in knowledge scores (12.42 ± 
4.15 vs. 15.54 ± 3.79, P = 0.0004, n = 26), self-care activities (4.74 ± 1.09 
vs. 5.32 ± 0.80, P = 0.0139, n = 24), and empowerment scores (6.56 ± 2.19 vs. 
8.11 ± 1.46, P = 0.0016, n = 21). The greatest difference between the two 
programs was observed in knowledge gain (P = 0.0178). Overall, participants were 
satisfied with both programs, with no difference seen in satisfaction levels (P 
= 0.9763). A1C results improved in both programs to a mean of 6.7% (P = 0.0071 
for CGHS and P = 0.0092 for Conversation Maps). Conclusion. The modified 
Conversation Maps program resulted in significant improvements for rural 
participants.
