Reporter systems are routinely used in plant genetic engineering and functional 
genomics research. Most such plant reporter systems cause accumulation of 
foreign proteins. Here, we demonstrate a protein-independent reporter system, 
3WJ-4 × Bro, based on a fluorescent RNA aptamer. Via transient expression assays 
in both Escherichia coli and Nicotiana benthamiana, we show that 3WJ-4 × Bro is 
suitable for transgene identification and as an mRNA reporter for expression 
pattern analysis. Following stable transformation in Arabidopsis thaliana, 3WJ-4 
× Bro co-segregates and co-expresses with target transcripts and is stably 
inherited through multiple generations. Further, 3WJ-4 × Bro can be used to 
visualize virus-mediated RNA delivery in plants. This study demonstrates a 
protein-independent reporter system that can be used for transgene 
identification and in vivo dynamic analysis of mRNA.
