Rapid growth of the geriatric population has been made possible with 
advancements in pharmaceutical and health sciences. Hence, age-associated 
diseases are becoming more common. Aging encompasses deterioration of the immune 
system, known as immunosenescence. Dysregulation of the immune cell production, 
differentiation, and functioning lead to a chronic subclinical inflammatory 
state termed inflammaging. The hallmarks of the aging immune system are 
decreased na√Øve cells, increased memory cells, and increased serum levels of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is a 
promising solution to halt immunosenescence as the cells have excellent 
immunomodulatory functions and low immunogenicity. This review compiles the 
present knowledge of the causes and changes of the aging immune system and the 
potential of MSC transplantation as a regenerative therapy for immunosenescence.
