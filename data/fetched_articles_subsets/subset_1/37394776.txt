The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has surged in many countries and replaced 
the previously reported VOC. To identify different Omicron strains/sublineages 
on a rapid, convenient, and precise platform, we report a novel multiplex 
real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method in one 
tube based on the Omicron lineage sequence variants' information. Severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) subvariants were used in a 
PCR-based assay for rapid identification of Omicron sublineage genotyping in 
1000 clinical samples. Several characteristic mutations were analyzed using 
specific primers and probes for the spike gene, del69-70, and F486V. To 
distinguish Omicron sublineages (BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5), the NSP1:141-143del in 
the ORF1a region and D3N mutation in membrane protein occurring outside the 
spike protein region were analyzed. Results from the real-time PCR assay for 
one-tube accuracy were compared to those of whole genome sequencing. The 
developed PCR assay was used to analyze 400 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Ten 
samples determined as BA.4 were positive for NSP1:141-143del, del69-70, and 
F486V mutations; 160 BA.5 samples were positive for D3N, del69-70, and F486V 
mutations, and 230 BA.2 samples were without del69-70. Screening these samples 
allowed the identification of epidemic trends at different time intervals. Our 
novel one-tube multiplex PCR assay was effective in identifying Omicron 
sublineages.
