Several analogues of the amino acid sequence of peptide 9-21 of glycoprotein D 
of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) were synthesized and investigated for 
reactivity with different group VII monoclonal antibodies, Mabs LP14, ID3, 170, 
HD4, A16, EII-24 and Ev-10, in a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). Replacement of Arg at position 16 by His resulted in a loss of binding 
with the group VII Mabs. Substitution of Pro at residue 14 by Leu gave a reduced 
binding for a number of Mabs and loss of binding for Mab A16. Substitution of 
Lys at position 10 by Glu gave reduced binding for three out of the seven Mabs. 
In addition substitutions of Met at position 11 by norleucine and oxidized Met 
were studied. The boundaries of the epitope cluster were mapped by studying 
synthetic variants of peptide 9-21 which were shorter either at the C-terminus 
or at the N-terminus, or both. Peptide 10-18 and peptide 9-17 were the shortest 
peptides, which were still reactive with the group VII Mabs. Mab HD4 requires 
the N-terminus of peptide 9-21 for effective binding, while for binding of other 
Mabs contribution of the residues in the C-terminal part of this peptide is more 
important.
