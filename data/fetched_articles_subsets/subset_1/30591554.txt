Transcription factor TFEB is thought to control cellular functions-including in 
the vascular bed-primarily via regulation of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic 
flux. Here, we report that TFEB also orchestrates a non-canonical program that 
controls the cell cycle/VEGFR2 pathway in the developing vasculature. In 
endothelial cells, TFEB depletion halts proliferation at the G1-S transition by 
inhibiting the CDK4/Rb pathway. TFEB-deficient cells attempt to compensate for 
this limitation by increasing VEGFR2 levels at the plasma membrane via 
microRNA-mediated mechanisms and controlled membrane trafficking. TFEB 
stimulates expression of the miR-15a/16-1 cluster, which limits VEGFR2 
transcript stability and negatively modulates expression of MYO1C, a regulator 
of VEGFR2 trafficking to the cell surface. Altered levels of miR-15a/16-1 and 
MYO1C in TFEB-depleted cells cause increased expression of plasma membrane 
VEGFR2, but in a manner associated with low signaling strength. An 
endothelium-specific Tfeb-knockout mouse model displays defects in fetal and 
newborn mouse vasculature caused by reduced endothelial proliferation and by 
anomalous function of the VEGFR2 pathway. These previously unrecognized 
functions of TFEB expand its role beyond regulation of the autophagic pathway in 
the vascular system.
