Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) is a β2 integrin classically regarded as a pro-inflammatory 
molecule because of its ability to promote phagocyte cytotoxic functions and 
enhance the function of several effector molecules such as FcγR, uPAR, and CD14. 
Nevertheless, recent reports have revealed that Mac-1 also plays significant 
immunoregulatory roles, and genetic variants in ITGAM, the gene that encodes 
CD11b, confer risk for the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus 
(SLE). This has renewed interest in the physiological roles of this integrin and 
raised new questions on how its seemingly opposing biological functions may be 
regulated. Here, we provide an overview of the CD18 integrins and how their 
activation may be regulated as this may shed light on how the opposing roles of 
Mac-1 may be elicited. We then discuss studies that exemplify Mac-1's 
pro-inflammatory versus regulatory roles particularly in the context of IgG 
immune complex-mediated inflammation. This includes a detailed examination of 
molecular mechanisms that could explain the risk-conferring effect of rs1143679, 
a single nucleotide non-synonymous Mac-1 polymorphism associated with SLE.
