Recurrent cardiovascular events remain an enigma that accounts for >30% of 
deaths worldwide. While heredity and human genetics variation play a key role, 
host-environment interactions offer a sound conceptual framework to dissect the 
molecular basis of recurrent cardiovascular events from genes and proteins to 
metabolites, thus accounting for environmental contributions as well. We report 
here a multiomics systems science approach so as to map interindividual 
variability in susceptibility to recurrent cardiovascular events. First, we 
performed data and text mining through a mixed-methods content analysis to 
select genomic variants, 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms, and microRNAs 
(miR-10a, miR-21, and miR-20a), minimizing bias in candidate marker selection. 
Next, we validated our in silico data in a patient cohort suffering from 
recurrent cardiovascular events (a cross-sectional study design and sampling). 
Our findings report a key role in low-density lipoprotein clearance for 
rs11206510 (p < 0.01) and rs515135 (p < 0.05). miR-10a (p < 0.05) was 
significantly associated with heart failure, while increased expression levels 
for miR-21 and miR-20a associated with atherosclerosis. In addition, liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry-based (LC-MS-based) proteomics analyses 
identified that vascular diameter and cholesterol levels are among the key 
factors to be considered in recurrent cardiovascular events. From a methodology 
innovation standpoint, this study offers a strategy to enhance the 
signal-to-noise ratios in mapping novel biomarker candidates wherein each 
research and conceptual step were interrogated for their validity and in turn, 
enriched one another, ideally translating information growth to knowledge 
growth.
