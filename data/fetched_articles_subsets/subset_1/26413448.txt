Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive disease which results from 
mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The aim of this study was 
the identification of sixteen different mutations in Iranian patients with 
hyperphenylalaninemia. The mutations were detected during the characterization 
of PAH genotypes of 39 PKU patients from Qazvin and Zanjan provinces of Iran. 
PAH mutations have been analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing of PCR products of 
the promoter region and all 13 exons of PAH gene, including the splicing sites. 
A mutation detection rate of 74.3 % was realized. Two mutations were found at 
high frequencies: R176X (10.25 %) and p.P281L (10.25 %). The frequencies of the 
other mutations were: IVS2+5G>A (2.56 %), IVS2+5G>C (2.56 %), p.L48S (2.56 %), 
p.R243Q (2.56 %), p.R252Q (5.12 %), p.R261Q (7.69 %), p.R261X (5.12 %), p.E280K 
(2.56 %), p.I283N (2.56 %), IVS9+5G>A (2.56 %), IVS9+1G>A (1.28 %), IVS11+1G>C 
(1.28 %), p.C357R (1.28 %), c.632delC (2.56 %). The present results confirm the 
high heterogeneity of the PAH locus and contribute to information about the 
distribution and frequency of PKU mutations in the Iranian population.
