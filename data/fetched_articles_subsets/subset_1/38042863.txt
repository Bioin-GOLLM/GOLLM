Pathogenic dsDNA prompts AIM2 assembly leading to the formation of the 
inflammasome, a multimeric complex that triggers the inflammatory response. The 
recognition of foreign dsDNA involves AIM2 self-assembly concomitant with dsDNA 
binding. However, we lack mechanistic and kinetic information on the formation 
and propagation of the assembly, which can shed light on innate immunity's time 
response and specificity. Combining optical traps and confocal fluorescence 
microscopy, we determine here the association and dissociation rates of the 
AIM2-DNA complex at the single molecule level. We identify distinct mechanisms 
for oligomer growth via the binding of incoming AIM2 molecules to adjacent dsDNA 
or direct interaction with bound AIM2 assemblies, resembling primary and 
secondary nucleation. Through these mechanisms, the size of AIM2 oligomers can 
increase fourfold in seconds. Finally, our data indicate that single AIM2 
molecules do not diffuse/scan along the DNA, suggesting that oligomerization 
depends on stochastic encounters with DNA and/or DNA-bound AIM2.
