Amyloid plaques contain many proteins in addition to beta amyloid (Aβ). Previous 
studies examining plaque-associated proteins have shown these additional 
proteins are important; they provide insight into the factors that drive amyloid 
plaque development and are potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to comprehensively identify 
proteins that are enriched in amyloid plaques using unbiased proteomics in two 
subtypes of early onset AD: sporadic early onset AD (EOAD) and Down Syndrome 
(DS) with AD. We focused our study on early onset AD as the drivers of the more 
aggressive pathology development in these cases is unknown and it is unclear 
whether amyloid-plaque enriched proteins differ between subtypes of early onset 
AD. Amyloid plaques and neighbouring non-plaque tissue were microdissected from 
human brain sections using laser capture microdissection and label-free LC-MS 
was used to quantify the proteins present. 48 proteins were consistently 
enriched in amyloid plaques in EOAD and DS. Many of these proteins were more 
significantly enriched in amyloid plaques than Aβ. The most enriched proteins in 
amyloid plaques in both EOAD and DS were: COL25A1, SMOC1, MDK, NTN1, OLFML3 and 
HTRA1. Endosomal/lysosomal proteins were particularly highly enriched in amyloid 
plaques. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was used to validate the enrichment of 
four proteins in amyloid plaques (moesin, ezrin, ARL8B and SMOC1) and to compare 
the amount of total Aβ, Aβ40, Aβ42, phosphorylated Aβ, pyroglutamate Aβ species 
and oligomeric species in EOAD and DS. These studies showed that phosphorylated 
Aβ, pyroglutamate Aβ species and SMOC1 were significantly higher in DS plaques, 
while oligomers were significantly higher in EOAD. Overall, we observed that 
amyloid plaques in EOAD and DS largely contained the same proteins, however the 
amount of enrichment of some proteins was different in EOAD and DS. Our study 
highlights the significant enrichment of many proteins in amyloid plaques, many 
of which may be potential therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers for AD.
