Research in recent decades has brought significant advancements in understanding 
of the molecular basis of the etiology of autoimmune diseases, including 
rheumatoid arthritis, a common systemic disease in which an inappropriate or 
inadequate immune response to environmental challenges leads to joint 
destruction. Recent studies have indicated that the classical viewpoint of the 
immunological processes underpinning the pathobiology of rheumatoid arthritis is 
restricted and needs to be expanded to include a more holistic and 
interdisciplinary approach incorporating bacteria-induced inflammatory reactions 
as an important pathway in rheumatoid arthritis etiology. Here, we discuss in 
detail data showing the clinical and molecular association of rheumatoid 
arthritis development with periodontal diseases. We also describe the unique 
role of periopathogens, which have been proposed to be crucial in the initiation 
and progression of this autoimmune pathological disorder.
