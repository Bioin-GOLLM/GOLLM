Cardiac pacing is the treatment of choice for the management of patients with 
bradycardia. Although right ventricular apical pacing is the standard therapy, 
it is associated with an increased risk of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy and 
heart failure. Physiological pacing using His bundle pacing and left bundle 
branch pacing has recently evolved as the preferred alternative pacing option. 
Both His bundle pacing and left bundle branch pacing have also demonstrated 
significant efficacy in correcting left bundle branch block and achieving 
cardiac resynchronisation therapy. In this article, the authors review the 
implantation tools and techniques to perform conduction system pacing.
