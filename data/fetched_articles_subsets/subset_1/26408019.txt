The infectious dose of a virus pool of original US PEDV strain PC22A was 
determined in 4-day-old, cesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) piglets. 
The median pig diarrhea dose (PDD50) of the virus pool was determined as 7.35 
log10 PDD50/mL, similar to the cell culture infectious titer, 7.75 log10 
plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. 100 PDD50 caused watery diarrhea in all 
conventional suckling piglets (n = 12) derived from a PEDV-naive sow, whereas 
1000 and 10 000 PDD50 did not cause diarrhea in piglets derived from two 
PEDV-field exposed-recovered sows. This information is important for future PEDV 
challenge studies and validation of PEDV vaccines.
