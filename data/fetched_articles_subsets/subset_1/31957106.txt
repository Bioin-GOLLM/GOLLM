BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We examined the allelic variants of N-methyl- 
d-aspartate receptor 2B (GRIN2B) and analyzed the associations between GRIN2B 
gene polymorphism with ketamine use conditions and psychopathological symptoms 
in chronic ketamine users.
METHODS: A total of 231 subjects were recruited. Four single nucleotide 
polymorphisms of GRIN2B, rs1805502, rs7301328, rs890, and rs1806201 were 
examined in 151 male chronic ketamine users and 80 controls. Psychopathological 
symptoms in chronic ketamine users were evaluated using the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory.
RESULTS: The genotype CC of rs1806201 had a lower frequency in ketamine users 
than that in control subjects (χ2  = 8.167, P = .004) and the T allele frequency 
of rs1806201 in ketamine users was higher than that in the control subjects 
(P = .009, odds ratio = 2.019 [1.196-3.410]). Ketamine users of genotype TT and 
CC of rs1806201 had an earlier onset of ketamine use than subjects of genotype 
TC (P = .038, P = .049, respectively). The dose of ketamine consumption per day 
of use was higher in genotype GG of rs7301328 than that in those with CG in 
ketamine users (P = .026). There were no significant differences of the severity 
of psychopathologic symptoms among different genotypes tested.
CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: GRIN2B gene polymorphism may play a role 
in ketamine abuse. (Am J Addict 2020;29:105-110).
