BACKGROUND: The frequencies of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and IDH2 
mutations among patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are different 
among different ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to determine the 
frequencies of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations among Egyptian AML patients and its 
effect on patient outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in 211 adult patients (104 men; 
107 women; age range, 18-68 years) with cytogenetically normal AML. DNA was 
extracted from bone marrow samples at the time of diagnosis. The exon 4 of IDH1 
and IDH2 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and sequenced for 
detection of mutations.
RESULTS: IDH1 mutations were detected in 18 of 211 AML patients (8.5%) in the 
form of 8 cases, R132H; 6 cases, R132C; 2 cases, R132S; 1 case, R132G; and 1 
case, R132V mutations). IDH2 mutations were detected in 22 of 211 AML patients 
(10.4%) in the form of 20 cases, R140Q; and 2 cases, R172K mutations. The 
overall survival after correction for nucleophosmin 1 and fims- related tyrosine 
kinase internal tandem duplication was significantly shorter in AML patients 
with the IDH mutation compared with those with wild type (P = .02).
CONCLUSION: IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are negative prognostic markers in AML 
patients. A novel mutation (R132V) was detected in IDH1 in our cohort of AML 
patients. We recommend molecular testing for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations for proper 
risk stratification of AML patients before the start of therapy.
