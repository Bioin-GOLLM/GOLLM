The Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE-1) attracts ongoing attention as a validated 
drug target for the management of cardiovascular and ocular diseases owing to 
cytoprotective, anti-ischemic and anti-inflammatory properties of NHE-1 
inhibitors. Herein we report novel NHE-1 inhibitors realized via 
functionalization of N1-alkyl quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione and 
quinazoline-4(3H)-one with N-acylguanidine or 3-acyl(5-amino-1,2,4-triazole) 
side chain. Lead compounds show activity in a nanomolar range. Their 
pharmacophoric features were elucidated with neural network modeling. Several 
compounds combine NHE-1 inhibition with antiplatelet activity. Compound 6b 
reduces intraocular pressure in rats and effectively inhibits the formation of 
glycated proteins. Compounds 3e and 3i inhibit pro-inflammatory activation of 
murine macrophages, LPS-induced interleukin-6 secretion and also exhibit 
antidepressant activity similar to amiloride. Hence, novel compounds represent 
an interesting starting point for the development of agents against 
cardiovascular diseases, thrombotic events, excessive inflammation, long-term 
diabetic complications and glaucoma.
