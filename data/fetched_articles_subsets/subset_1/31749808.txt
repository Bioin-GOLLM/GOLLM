The human ribonuclease RNase 7 has been originally isolated from human skin and 
is a member of the human RNase A superfamily. RNase 7 is constantly released by 
keratinocytes and accumulates on the skin surface. The expression of RNase 7 in 
keratinocytes can be induced by diverse stimuli such as cytokines, growth 
factors, and microbial factors. RNase 7 exhibits a potent broad spectrum of 
antimicrobial activity against various microorganisms and contributes to control 
bacterial growth on the skin surface. The ribonuclease and antimicrobial 
activity of RNase 7 can be blocked by the endogenous ribonuclease inhibitor. 
There is also increasing evidence that RNase 7 exerts immunomodulatory 
activities and may participate in antiviral defense. In this review, we discuss 
how these characteristics of RNase 7 contribute to innate cutaneous defense and 
highlight its role in skin infection and inflammation. We also speculate how a 
potential dysregulation of RNase 7 promotes inflammatory skin diseases and if 
RNase 7 may have therapeutic potential.
