Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein 
kinases (PIKK) are two structurally related families of kinases that play vital 
roles in cell growth and DNA damage repair. Dysfunction of PIKK members and 
aberrant stimulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway are linked to a 
plethora of diseases including cancer. In recent decades, numerous inhibitors 
related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling have made great strides in cancer 
treatment, like copanlisib and sirolimus. Notably, most of the PIKK inhibitors 
(such as VX-970 and M3814) related to DNA damage response have also shown good 
efficacy in clinical trials. However, these drugs still require a suitable 
combination therapy to overcome drug resistance or improve antitumor activity. 
Based on the aforementioned facts, we summarised the efficacy of PIKK, PI3K, and 
AKT inhibitors in the therapy of human malignancies and the resistance 
mechanisms of targeted therapy, in order to provide deeper insights into cancer 
treatment.
