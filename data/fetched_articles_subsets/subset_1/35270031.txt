Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in shrimp is caused by Vibrio 
strains that harbor a pVA1-like plasmid containing the pirA and pirB genes. It 
is also known that the production of the PirA and PirB proteins, which are the 
key factors that drive the observed symptoms of AHPND, can be influenced by 
environmental conditions and that this leads to changes in the virulence of the 
bacteria. However, to our knowledge, the mechanisms involved in regulating the 
expression of the pirA/pirB genes have not previously been investigated. In this 
study, we show that in the AHPND-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus 3HP strain, the 
pirAvp and pirBvp genes are highly expressed in the early log phase of the 
growth curve. Subsequently, the expression of the PirAvp and PirBvp proteins 
continues throughout the log phase. When we compared mutant strains with a 
deletion or substitution in two of the quorum sensing (QS) master regulators, 
luxO and/or opaR (luxOD47E, ΔopaR, ΔluxO, and ΔopaRΔluxO), our results suggested 
that expression of the pirAvp and pirBvp genes was related to the QS system, 
with luxO acting as a negative regulator of pirAvp and pirBvp without any 
mediation by opaRvp. In the promoter region of the pirAvp/pirBvp operon, we also 
identified a putative consensus binding site for the QS transcriptional 
regulator AphB. Real-time PCR further showed that aphBvp was negatively 
controlled by LuxOvp, and that its expression paralleled the expression patterns 
of pirAvp and pirBvp. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that 
AphBvp could bind to this predicted region, even though another QS 
transcriptional regulator, AphAvp, could not. Taken together, these findings 
suggest that the QS system may regulate pirAvp/pirBvp expression through AphBvp.
