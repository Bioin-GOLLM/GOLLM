The rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with high severity and 
transmutability adds further urgency for rapid and multiplex molecular testing 
to identify the variants. A nucleotide matrix-assisted 
laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF 
MS)-based assay was developed (called point mutation array, PMA) to identify 
four major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) including Alpha, Beta, Delta, 
and Omicron (namely PMA-ABDO) and differentiate Omicron subvariant (namely 
PMA-Omicron). PMA-ABDO and PMA-Omicron consist of 24 and 28 mutation sites of 
the spike gene. Both PMA panels specifically identified VOCs with as low as 10 
viral copies/µl. The panel has shown a 100% concordant with the Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS) results testing on 256 clinical specimens with real-time PCR 
cycle threshold (Ct) values less than 26. It showed a higher sensitivity over 
NGS; 25/28 samples were positive by PMA but not NGS in the clinical samples with 
PCR Ct higher than 26. Due to the mass of nucleotide used to differentiate 
between wild-type and mutation strains, the co-infection or recombination of 
multiple variants can be determined by the PMA method. This method is flexible 
in adding a new primer set to identify a new emerging mutation site among the 
current circulating VOCs and the turnaround time is less than 8 h. However, the 
spike gene sequencing or NGS retains the advantage of detecting newly emerged 
variants.
