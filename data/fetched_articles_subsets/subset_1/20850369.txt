OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of wild-type, mutant and loss of 
leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2; Lrrk2) on dendritic neuronal arborization.
BACKGROUND: LRRK2 mutations are recognized as the major genetic determinant of 
susceptibility to Parkinson's disease for which a cellular assay of Lrrk2 mutant 
function would facilitate the development of targeted molecular therapeutics.
METHODS: Dendritic neuronal arborization (neurite length, branching and the 
number of processes per cell) was quantified in primary hippocampal and midbrain 
cultures derived from five lines of recombinant LRRK2 mice, including human BAC 
wild-type and mutant overexpressors (Y1699C and G2019S), murine knock-out and 
G2019S knock-in animals.
RESULTS: Neuronal arborization in cultures from BAC Lrrk2 wild-type animals is 
comparable to non-transgenic littermate controls, despite high levels of human 
transgene expression. In contrast, primary neurons from both BAC mutant 
overexpressors presented with significantly reduced neuritic outgrowth and 
branching, although the total number of processes per cell remained comparable. 
The mutant-specific toxic gain-of-function observed in cultures from BAC mutant 
mice may be partially rescued by staurosporine treatment, a non-specific kinase 
inhibitor. In contrast, neuronal arborization is far more extensive in neuronal 
cultures derived from murine knock-out mice that lack endogenous Lrrk2 
expression. In Lrrk2 G2019S knock-in mice, arguably the most physiologically 
relevant system, neuritic arborization is not impaired.
CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of neuritic arborization is an exaggerated, albeit 
mutant specific, consequence of Lrrk2 over-expression in primary cultures. The 
phenotype and assay described provides a means to develop therapeutic agents 
that modulate the toxic gain-of-function conferred by mutant Lrrk2.
