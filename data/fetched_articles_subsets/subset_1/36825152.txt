Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had 
a disastrous effect worldwide during the previous three years due to widespread 
infections with SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variations. More than 674 million 
confirmed cases and over 6.7 million deaths have been attributed to successive 
waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections as of 29th January 2023. Similar to other RNA 
viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is more susceptible to genetic evolution and spontaneous 
mutations over time, resulting in the continual emergence of variants with 
distinct characteristics. Spontaneous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants increase 
its transmissibility, virulence, and disease severity and diminish the efficacy 
of therapeutics and vaccines, resulting in vaccine-breakthrough infections and 
re-infection, leading to high mortality and morbidity rates. Materials and 
methods: In this study, we evaluated 10,531 whole genome sequences of all 
reported variants globally through a computational approach to assess the spread 
and emergence of the mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The available data 
sources of NextCladeCLI 2.3.0 (https://clades.nextstrain.org/) and NextStrain 
(https://nextstrain.org/) were searched for tracking SARS-CoV-2 mutations, 
analysed using the PROVEAN, Polyphen-2, and Predict SNP mutational analysis 
tools and validated by Machine Learning models. Result: Compared to the 
Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain NC 045512.2, genome-wide annotations showed 16,954 
mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We determined that the Omicron variant had 
6,307 mutations (retrieved sequence:1947), including 67.8% unique mutations, 
more than any other variant evaluated in this study. The spike protein of the 
Omicron variant harboured 876 mutations, including 443 deleterious mutations. 
Among these deleterious mutations, 187 were common and 256 were unique 
non-synonymous mutations. In contrast, after analysing 1,884 sequences of the 
Delta variant, we discovered 4,468 mutations, of which 66% were unique, and not 
previously reported in other variants. Mutations affecting spike proteins are 
mostly found in RBD regions for Omicron, whereas most of the Delta variant 
mutations drawn to focus on amino acid regions ranging from 911 to 924 in the 
context of epitope prediction (B cell & T cell) and mutational stability impact 
analysis protruding that Omicron is more transmissible. Discussion: The 
pathogenesis of the Omicron variant could be prevented if the deleterious and 
persistent unique immunosuppressive mutations can be targeted for vaccination or 
small-molecule inhibitor designing. Thus, our findings will help researchers 
monitor and track the continuously evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 strains, the 
associated genetic variants, and their implications for developing effective 
control and prophylaxis strategies.
