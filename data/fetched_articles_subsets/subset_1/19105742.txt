The recent advance in technology for mass spectrometry-based targeted protein 
quantification has opened new avenues for a broad range of proteomic 
applications in clinical research. The major breakthroughs are highlighted by 
the capability of using a "universal" approach to perform quantitative assays 
for a wide spectrum of proteins with minimum restrictions and the ease of 
assembling multiplex detections in a single measurement. The quantitative 
approach relies on the use of synthetic stable isotope labeled peptides or 
proteins, which precisely mimic their endogenous counterparts and act as 
internal standards to quantify the corresponding candidate proteins. This report 
reviews recently developed platform technologies for emerging applications of 
clinical proteomics and biomarker development.
