Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is an inherited cancer 
predisposition syndrome caused by autosomal dominant heterozygous pathogenic 
variants in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene. FH pathogenic variant carriers are 
at an increased risk for cutaneous leiomyomas, renal cell cancer, and uterine 
fibroids. We present a case series of patients identified at two different 
medical institutions with clinically diagnostic features of HLRCC and a shared 
rare variant in the FH gene.
