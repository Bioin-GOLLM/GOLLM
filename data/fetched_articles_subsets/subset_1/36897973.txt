Inflammation causes pain by shifting the balance of ionic currents in 
nociceptors toward depolarization, leading to hyperexcitability. The ensemble of 
ion channels within the plasma membrane is regulated by processes including 
biogenesis, transport, and degradation. Thus, alterations in ion channel 
trafficking may influence excitability. Sodium channel NaV1.7 and potassium 
channel KV7.2 promote and oppose excitability in nociceptors, respectively. We 
used live-cell imaging to investigate mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators 
(IM) modulate the abundance of these channels at axonal surfaces through 
transcription, vesicular loading, axonal transport, exocytosis, and endocytosis. 
Inflammatory mediators induced a NaV1.7-dependent increase in activity in distal 
axons. Further, inflammation increased the abundance of NaV1.7, but not of 
KV7.2, at axonal surfaces by selectively increasing channel loading into 
anterograde transport vesicles and insertion at the membrane, without affecting 
retrograde transport. These results uncover a cell biological mechanism for 
inflammatory pain and suggest NaV1.7 trafficking as a potential therapeutic 
target.
