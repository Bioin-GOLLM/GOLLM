Arsenic (As) removal is of major significance because inorganic arsenic is 
highly toxic to all life forms, is a confirmed carcinogen, and is of significant 
environmental concern. As contamination in drinking water alone threatens more 
than 150 million people all over the world. Therefore, several conventional 
methods such as oxidation, coagulation, adsorption, etc., have been implemented 
for As removal, but due to their cost-maintenance limitations; there is a drive 
for advanced, low cost nanofiltration membrane-based technology. Thus, in order 
to address the increasing demand of fresh and drinking water, this review 
focuses on advanced nanofiltration (NF) strategy for As removal to safeguard 
water security. The review concentrates on different types of NF membranes, 
membrane fabrication processes, and their mechanism and efficiency of 
performance for removing As from contaminated water. The article provides an 
overview of the current status of polymer-, polymer composite-, and polymer 
nanocomposite-based NF membranes, to assess the status of 
nanomaterial-facilitated NF membranes and to incite progress in this area. 
Finally, future perspectives and future trends are highlighted.
