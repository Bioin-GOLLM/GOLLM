The international precision oncology program INFORM enrolls relapsed/refractory 
pediatric cancer patients for comprehensive molecular analysis. We report a 
two-year pilot study implementing ex vivo drug sensitivity profiling (DSP) using 
a library of 75-78 clinically relevant drugs. We included 132 viable tumor 
samples from 35 pediatric oncology centers in seven countries. DSP was conducted 
on multicellular fresh tumor tissue spheroid cultures in 384-well plates with an 
overall mean processing time of three weeks. In 89 cases (67%), sufficient 
viable tissue was received; 69 (78%) passed internal quality controls. The DSP 
results matched the identified molecular targets, including BRAF, ALK, MET, and 
TP53 status. Drug vulnerabilities were identified in 80% of cases lacking 
actionable (very) high-evidence molecular events, adding value to the molecular 
data. Striking parallels between clinical courses and the DSP results were 
observed in selected patients. Overall, DSP in clinical real-time is feasible in 
international multicenter precision oncology programs.
