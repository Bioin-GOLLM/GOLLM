In this study, the frequencies of the common hemochromatosis gene mutations were 
assessed in 75 Iranian subjects with chronic hepatitis B infection. We found 
that the major C282Y mutation was significantly more frequent in subjects 
infected with hepatitis B virus (4%) than in 194 control subjects (0%, P=.02; 
Fisher's exact test).
