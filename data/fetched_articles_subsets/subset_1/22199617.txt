In the title complex, [CuCl(2)(C(24)H(24)N(2)O(2))], the Cu(II) cation is 
N,N',O-chelated by a 2,2'-(1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyldiimino)-diethanol ligand 
and coordinated by two chloride anions in a distorted square-pyramidal geometry. 
In the diethanol ligand, the two naphthalene ring systems are twisted with 
respect to each other at a dihedral angle of 68.30 (9)°. The uncoord-inated 
hy-droxy group links with a coordinated chloride anion via an intra-molecular 
O-H⋯Cl hydrogen bond. Inter-molecular N-H⋯O and N-H⋯Cl hydrogen bonds occur in 
the crystal structure.
