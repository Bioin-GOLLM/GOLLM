The effect of the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 on glutamate 
release was investigated in the striatum of young and old rats by microdialysis 
experiments. SCH 58261 (50 nM) significantly decreased the spontaneous and 
K+-evoked glutamate outflow in young rats. In aged rats, spontaneous glutamate 
outflow was significantly reduced in comparison to young rats and SCH 58261 
significantly increased spontaneous and K+-evoked glutamate outflow. It is 
suggested that the opposite effects of the A2A antagonist on glutamate outflow 
in young and aged rats can be respectively attributed to blockade of striatal 
A2A adenosine receptors located on glutamatergic terminals and on the striatal 
indirect output pathway.
