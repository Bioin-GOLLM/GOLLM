Quantitative individual differences in the amount of β-casein in goat milk are 
determined by at least nine alleles. In particular, two alleles (CSN2(0) and 
CSN2(01) ) are associated with an undetectable amount of this protein in milk. 
The CSN2(01) allele is characterized by a single nucleotide substitution at 
position 373 of the seventh exon (AJ011018:g.8915C>T), responsible for the 
formation of a premature stop codon at the 182 position. Herein, we report the 
contribution of the SNP g.1311T>C, which demonstrates a linkage with the SNP 
AJ011018:g.8915C>T, to the promoter transcriptional activity. Particularly, we 
indicate that the nucleotide C at position 1311 negatively affects the promoter 
activity of the CSN2 gene.
