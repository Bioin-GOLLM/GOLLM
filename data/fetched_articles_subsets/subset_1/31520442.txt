BACKGROUND: The peanut allergens Ara h 2, h 6, and h 7 are potent allergens and 
can trigger severe reactions. Ara h 7 consists of three isoforms differing in 
their ability to induce basophil degranulation, whereas the ability of 
Ara h 7.0201 is comparable to Ara h 2 and 6 as shown in previous literature.
OBJECTIVE: To identify linear epitopes of Ara h 7.0101, Ara h 7.0201 and 
Ara h 7.0301 recognized by IgE and IgG4 from patients sensitized to Ara h 7 and 
to investigate their potential to elucidate divergent abilities of the Ara h 7 
isoforms in inducing basophil activation.
METHODS: Linear epitopes recognized by IgE and IgG4 were mapped by peptide 
microarray analysis containing 15-mer peptides of Ara h 2.0201, 6, 7.0101, 
7.0201 and 7.0301 and 39 peanut allergic patients sensitized to Ara h 7 
(discovery). For validation, 20-mer peptides containing the minimal epitope and 
surrounding amino acids were incubated with 25 sensitized patients and 10 
controls (validation).
RESULTS: Three out of 14 linear epitopes were unique for each isoform (Ara h 
7.0101: aa 97-109; Ara h 7.0201: aa 122-133; Ara h 7.0301: aa 65-74) but 
scarcely recognized by IgE. The main linear IgE epitope (aa 51-57) located in 
the long flexible loop of all Ara h 7 isoforms was bound by antibodies from 31% 
of the patients (discovery and validation cohort). Regarding IgG4, 55% of the 
patients recognized an epitope present on all isoforms (aa 55-65), whereas 
epitope aa 129-137, only present on Ara h 7.0101/0.0301, was recognized by 38% 
of the patients. Recognition was highly individual, although 20% of the patients 
recognized any linear epitope neither by IgE nor by IgG4 despite a low mean 
z-score of ≥ 1.7. Remarkably, only 50% of the patients recognized one or more 
epitopes by IgE.
CONCLUSION & CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Ara h 7 isoforms share many linear epitopes 
being easily accessible for antibody binding. Unique epitopes, essential to 
elucidate divergent potencies, were scarcely recognized, suggesting a crucial 
involvement of conformational epitopes.
