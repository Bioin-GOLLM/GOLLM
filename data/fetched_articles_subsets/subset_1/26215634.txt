BACKGROUND: Characterization of molecular mechanisms underpinning development of 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may lead to the identification of novel 
therapeutic targets and biomarkers. SgK223, also known as Pragmin, is a 
pseudokinase and scaffolding protein closely related to SgK269/PEAK1. Both 
proteins are implicated in oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling, but their 
mechanisms and function remain poorly characterized.
METHODS: Expression of SgK223 in PDAC and PDAC cell lines was characterized 
using gene expression microarrays, mass spectrometry (MS)-based 
phosphoproteomics and Western blotting. SgK223 was overexpressed in human 
pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells via retroviral transduction, and 
knocked down in PDAC cells using siRNA. Cell proliferation was determined using 
a colorimetric cell viability assay, and cell migration and invasion using 
transwells. Expression of markers of epithelial-mesenchyme transition (EMT) was 
assayed by quantitative PCR. SgK223 and Stat3 signaling was interrogated by 
immunoprecipitation, Western blot and gene reporter assays. The functional role 
of specific kinases and Stat3 was determined using selective small molecule 
inhibitors.
RESULTS: Elevated site-selective tyrosine phosphorylation of SgK223 was 
identified in subsets of PDAC cell lines, and increased expression of SgK223 
detected in several PDAC cell lines compared to human pancreatic ductal 
epithelial (HPDE) cells and in PDACs compared to normal pancreas. Expression of 
SgK223 in HPDE cells at levels comparable to those in PDAC did not alter cell 
proliferation but led to a more elongated morphology, enhanced migration and 
invasion and induced gene expression changes characteristic of a partial EMT. 
While SgK223 overexpression did not affect activation of Erk or Akt, it led to 
increased Stat3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and Stat3 transcriptional activity, and 
SgK223 and Stat3 associated in vivo. SgK223-overexpressing cells exhibited 
increased JAK1 activation, and use of selective inhibitors determined that the 
increased Stat3 signaling driven by SgK223 was JAK-dependent. Pharmacological 
inhibition of Stat3 revealed that Stat3 activation was required for the enhanced 
motility and invasion of SgK223-overexpressing cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of SgK223 occurs in PDAC, and overexpression 
of SgK223 in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells promotes acquisition of a 
migratory and invasive phenotype through enhanced JAK1/Stat3 signaling. This 
represents the first association of SgK223 with a particular human cancer, and 
links SgK223 with a major signaling pathway strongly implicated in PDAC 
progression.
