We designed, synthesized, and characterized a novel nucleoside analog, 
(1S,3S,5S)-3-(2-amino-6-oxo-1,6-dihydro-9H-purin-9-yl)-5-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylene-cyclopentanecarbonitrile, 
or 4'-cyano-methylenecarbocyclic-2'-deoxyguanosine (CMCdG), and evaluated its 
anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBV) activity, safety, and related features. 
CMCdG's in vitro activity was determined using quantitative PCR and Southern 
blotting assays, and its cytotoxicity was determined with a 
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, while 
its in vivo activity and safety were determined in human liver-chimeric mice 
infected with wild-type HBV genotype Ce (HBVWTCe) and an entecavir 
(ETV)-resistant HBV variant containing the amino acid substitutions L180M, 
S202G, and M204V (HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V). CMCdG potently inhibited HBV 
production in HepG2.2.15 cells (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], ∼30 nM) and 
HBVWTCe plasmid-transfected Huh7 cells (IC50, 206 nM) and efficiently suppressed 
ETV-resistant HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V (IC50, 2,657 nM), while it showed no or 
little cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration, >500 μM in most hepatocytic 
cells examined). Two-week peroral administration of CMCdG (1 mg/kg of body 
weight/day once a day [q.d.]) to HBVWTCe-infected human liver-chimeric mice 
reduced the level of viremia by ∼2 logs. CMCdG also reduced the level of 
HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V viremia by ∼1 log in 
HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V-infected human liver-chimeric mice, while ETV 
(1 mg/kg/day q.d.) completely failed to reduce the viremia. None of the 
CMCdG-treated mice had significant drug-related changes in body weights or serum 
human albumin levels. Structural analyses using homology modeling, semiempirical 
quantum methods, and molecular dynamics revealed that although ETV triphosphate 
(TP) forms good van der Waals contacts with L180 and M204 of HBVWTCe reverse 
transcriptase (RT), its contacts with the M180 substitution are totally lost in 
the HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V RT complex. However, CMCdG-TP retains good 
contacts with both the HBVWTCe RT and HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V RT complexes. 
The present data warrant further studies toward the development of CMCdG as a 
potential therapeutic for patients infected with drug-resistant HBV and shed 
light on the further development of more potent and safer anti-HBV agents.
