BACKGROUND: Matching and comparing sequence annotations of different reference 
sequences is vital to genomics research, yet many annotation formats do not 
specify the reference sequence types or versions used. This makes the 
integration of annotations from different sources difficult and error prone.
RESULTS: As part of our effort to create linked data for interoperable sequence 
annotations, we present an RDF data model for sequence annotation using the 
ontological framework established by the OBO Foundry ontologies and the Basic 
Formal Ontology (BFO). We defined reference sequences as the common domain of 
integration for sequence annotations, and identified three semantic 
relationships between sequence annotations. In doing so, we created the 
Reference Sequence Annotation to compensate for gaps in the SO and in its 
mapping to BFO, particularly for annotations that refer to versions of consensus 
reference sequences. Moreover, we present three integration models for sequence 
annotations using different reference assemblies.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a working example of a sequence annotation 
instance, and how this instance can be linked to other annotations on different 
reference sequences. Sequence annotations in this format are semantically rich 
and can be integrated easily with different assemblies. We also identify other 
challenges of modeling reference sequences with the BFO.
