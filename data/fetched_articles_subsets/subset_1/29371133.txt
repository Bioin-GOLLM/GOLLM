BACKGROUND: Inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) has been shown to increase 
mucociliary clearance (MCC) and improve clinical outcomes in adults and 
adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, in younger children with CF, a 
large study failed to demonstrate clinical benefits. This discrepancy could 
reflect pharmacodynamic differences in the MCC response to HS in different 
populations. We previously demonstrated the absence of a sustained effect of HS 
on MCC in healthy adults and in this study sought to characterize the durability 
of the MCC response to HS in adults with CF.
METHODS: At two study sites, MCC was measured in CF adults using gamma 
scintigraphy during three separate visits: at baseline, 15 min, and 4 h after a 
single dose of HS (7% NaCl, 4 mL). Particle clearance rates at these visits were 
used to assess the durability of the MCC response to HS.
RESULTS: The average 90-minute clearance rate measured 4 h after HS was 
significantly increased (21.81% ± 12.8) when compared to baseline (13.77% ± 8.7, 
p = .048) and showed no apparent slowing relative to the rate measured 15 min 
after HS. While not all subjects responded to HS, the acute response strongly 
predicted the sustained effect in these subjects (r = 0.896, p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in contrast to healthy adults, a single 
dose of HS has a prolonged effect on MCC in adults with CF, which lasts at least 
4 h. This may explain its clinical efficacy in this population.
