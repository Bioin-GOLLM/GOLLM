A circadian oscillation can be reconstituted in vitro from three proteins that 
cycles with a period of ∼ 24 h. Two recent studies provide surprising 
biochemical answers to why this remarkable oscillator has such a long time 
constant and how it can switch effortlessly between alternating enzymatic modes.
