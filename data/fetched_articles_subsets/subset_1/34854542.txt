Gain of function PIK3CA pathogenic variants have been identified in overgrowth 
syndromes collectively termed "PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum" (PROS). There 
are no previously reported cases of cerebrovascular venous malformations in PROS 
syndromes, though somatic activating PIK3CA variants have been identified in 
extracranial venous malformation. This study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Boar at Boston Children's Hospital. A 14-year-old female mosaic for the 
de novo p.R108H pathogenic variant in the PIK3CA gene was found to have a large 
tumor involving the superior sagittal sinus with mass effect on the motor cortex 
most consistent with a parafalcine meningioma. She underwent surgical resection 
with pathology demonstrating a venous malformation. PIK3CA pathogenic variants 
have been identified in nonsyndromic extracranial venous and lymphatic 
malformations as well in brain tumors, including glioma and meningioma. However, 
PIK3CA variants have not previously been identified in purely intracranial 
venous malformations. This distinction is relevant to treatment decisions, given 
that mTOR inhibitors may provide an alternative option for noninvasive therapy 
in cases of suspected venous malformation.
