Designing and preparing chloroprene rubber (CR) with robust mechanical and 
excellent flame retardancy performance are challenging. In this work, a 
biomimetic design for high mechanical and flame-retardant CR by synchronous 
introducing of sacrificial bond (disulfide) crosslinked networks into the 
chemically crosslinked network is developed based on two new types of 
vulcanization reactions. Under the catalysis of Mg(OH)2, the dynamic bond 
cross-linked network is formed by the reaction between the amino group of 
cystamine dihydrochloride (CA) and the allylic chlorine group of CR, while the 
covalently crosslinked network is synchronously formed by two types of 
nucleophilic substitution reactions in series between Mg(OH)2 and CR. The 
disulfide bonds serve as sacrificial bonds that preferentially rupture prior to 
the covalent network, dissipating energy and facilitating rubber chain 
orientation, so a CA-0.5 sample (CR/CA(0.5 wt%)/Mg(OH)2 (10 wt%) with dual 
crosslinked networks exhibits excellent mechanical performance, and the tensile 
strength and elongation at the break of CA-0.5 are 1.41 times and 1.17 times 
greater than those of the CR-0 sample with covalently crosslinked networks, 
respectively. Moreover, the addition of Mg(OH)2 significantly improves the flame 
retardancy of CR.
