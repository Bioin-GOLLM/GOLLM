Minor allele frequency (MAF) of rs3782886 (BRAP) and rs671 (ALDH2) are reported 
to be inversely associated with blood pressure. Another study revealed that 
hematopoietic activity which is evaluated by reticulocytes could influenced on 
hypertension status partly by indicating activity of endothelial maintenance. 
Therefore, to evaluate the association between genetic factor and hypertension, 
influence of hematopoietic activity should be considered. A multi-faced analysis 
was performed in a simple general elderly population model (1,313 older Japanese 
aged 60-98 years). Participants were stratified by median values of 
reticulocytes (5.21 × 104 cells/μL for men and 4.65 × 104 cells/μL for women). 
Independent of known cardiovascular risk factors, MAF of rs3782886 and rs671 are 
significantly inversely associated with hypertension for participants with high 
hematopoietic activity (high reticulocytes level) (fully adjusted odds ratio 
(ORs) were 0.72 (0.55, 0.96) for rs3782886 and 0.72 (0.54, 0.96) for rs671) but 
not for low reticulocytes count (the corresponding values were 1.05 (0.79, 1.39) 
and 1.08 (0.81, 1.45), respectively). Hematopoietic activity evaluated by 
reticulocytes levels could influence on the association between single 
nucleotide polymorphism (rs3782886 and rs671) and hypertension. Those results 
were efficient tool to clarify the part of the mechanism that underlying the 
association between genetic factor and hypertension.
