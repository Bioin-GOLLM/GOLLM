BACKGROUND: To assess the relationship of the shape of glucose concentration 
curve during a standardized meal test to serum free fatty acid (FFA) 
concentrations, insulin resistance and insulin secretion in young non-obese 
women.
METHODS: Thirty-five young women had a standardized meal for breakfast with 
measurement of glucose, insulin and FFA concentrations at 0 (fasting), 30, 60 
and 120 min; the areas under the concentration curves were calculated (AUCg, 
AUCi and AUCffa, respectively). Meal-induced insulin response (MIR) was 
calculated as the ratio between the incremental insulin and glucose 
concentrations during the first 30 min of meal tests. In two women (group A), 
post-breakfast glucose (PBG) returned to levels below fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG) at 30 min; in 15 and 11 women, PBG returned to levels below FPG at 60 and 
120 min (groups B and C, respectively). In the remaining seven women (group D), 
PBG never fell below FPG.
RESULTS: Despite no difference in fasting insulin and AUCi, fasting FFA, AUCg 
and AUCffa were the lowest in group A, increased linearly from group B to C and 
plateaued in group D, whereas MIR might be the highest in group A, decreased 
from group B to C and plateaued in group D.
CONCLUSION: Young women whose PBG returned to FPG more slowly had higher muscle 
insulin resistance and lower MIR associated with higher fasting and postprandial 
FFA levels compared with young women whose PBG returned to baseline more 
quickly.
