BACKGROUND: SLCO1B1 polymorphisms are relevant in statin pharmacokinetics. Aim 
of this study was to investigate the genetic variability and haplotype profile 
of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in Roma and Hungarian populations. Genotypes of 470 
Roma and 442 Hungarian subjects for c.388A > G, c.521T > C and c.1498-1331T > C 
polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP assay. Using these SNPs eight 
different haplotypes could be differentiated.
RESULTS: Differences were found between Roma and Hungarians in SLCO1B1 388AA 
(24.5 vs. 45.5 %), GG (33.4 vs. 17.9 %) genotypes, AG + GG (75.5 vs. 54.5 %) 
carriers, in G allele frequency (0.545 vs. 0.362), respectively (p < 0.001). The 
most common SLCO1B1 haplotype was the ht8 (GTT) both in Roma (43.6 %) and in 
Hungarian (59.1 %) samples. The ht6 (GCT) was not present in Roma population 
samples Haplotype analyses showed striking differences between the Roma and 
Hungarian samples in ht4 (ATT, 37.2 % vs 20.8 %), ht5 (GCC, 1.15 % vs. 3.62 %) 
and ht8 (GTT, 43.6 % vs. 59.1 %) haplotypes (p < 0.01), respectively. Linkage 
disequilibrium analysis showed that the studied variants are in different 
linkage disequilibrium patterns depending on the ethnic origin.
CONCLUSIONS: Similarly to Caucasians the 388G is the minor allele in Hungarians, 
however, in Roma the 388A was found to be the minor allele contrary to Indians 
(India). The minor allele frequency of 521T > C and 1498-1331T > C SNPs are 
almost three times higher in Romas than in Indians (Singapore and Gujarati, 
respectively). Observed allele frequency for 1498-1331T > C polymorphism 
reflects the measured average European rates in Hungarians. The results can be 
applied in population specific treatment algorithms when developing effective 
programs for statin therapy.
