BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus occurs primarily in elderly or 
immunocompromised individuals after reactivation of varicella zoster virus 
(VZV). Recurrences of zoster ophthalmicus are uncommon because the reactivation 
efficiently boosts anti-VZV immunity. A 28-year-old female presented to our 
clinic with a history of multiple recurrences of zoster ophthalmicus.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES), analyses of VZV T-cell immunity, and 
pathogen recognition receptor function in primary antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) and fibroblasts were performed.
RESULTS: Normal VZV-specific T-cell immunity and antibody response were 
detected. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous nonsynonymous variant 
(c.2324C > T) in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) gene resulting in formation of 
a premature stop-codon. This alteration could potentially undermine TLR3 
signaling in a dominant-negative fashion. Therefore, we investigated TLR3 
signaling responses in APCs and fibroblasts from the patient. The APCs responded 
efficiently to stimulation with TLR3 ligands, whereas the responses from the 
fibroblasts were compromised.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel TLR3 variant associated with recurrent zoster 
ophthalmicus. Toll-like receptor 3 responses that were unaffected in APCs but 
diminished in fibroblasts are in line with previous reports linking TLR3 
deficiency with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Mechanisms involving 
compromised viral sensing in infected cells may thus be central to the described 
immunodeficiency.
