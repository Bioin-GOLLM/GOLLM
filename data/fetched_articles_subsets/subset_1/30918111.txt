Tau inclusions are a shared feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, among 
them frontotemporal dementia caused by tau mutations. Treatment approaches for 
these conditions include targeting posttranslational modifications of tau 
proteins, maintaining a steady-state amount of tau, and preventing its tendency 
to aggregate. We discovered a new regulatory pathway for tau degradation that 
operates through the farnesylated protein, Rhes, a GTPase in the Ras family. 
Here, we show that treatment with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor lonafarnib 
reduced Rhes and decreased brain atrophy, tau inclusions, tau sumoylation, and 
tau ubiquitination in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy. In addition, 
lonafarnib treatment attenuated behavioral abnormalities in rTg4510 mice and 
reduced microgliosis in mouse brain. Direct reduction of Rhes in the rTg4510 
mouse by siRNA reproduced the results observed with lonafarnib treatment. The 
mechanism of lonafarnib action mediated by Rhes to reduce tau pathology was 
shown to operate through activation of lysosomes. We finally showed in mouse 
brain and in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons a normal 
developmental increase in Rhes that was initially suppressed by tau mutations. 
The known safety of lonafarnib revealed in human clinical trials for cancer 
suggests that this drug could be repurposed for treating tauopathies.
