Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type I transmembrane proteins that are key 
regulators of both innate and adaptive immune responses. To protect the host 
from viral and bacterial threats, TLRs trigger a pro-inflammatory immune 
response by detecting pathogen and danger associated molecular patterns. 
Considerable evidence has accumulated to show that the dysregulation of TLR 
signaling contributes to the development and progression of numerous diseases. 
Therefore, TLRs are emerging as important drug discovery targets. Currently, 
there is great interest in the development of TLR small molecule modulators for 
interrogating TLR signaling and treating diseases caused by TLR signaling 
malfunctions. In this tutorial review, we will outline methods for the discovery 
of TLR small molecule modulators and the up-to-date progress in this field. 
Small molecules targeting TLRs not only provide an opportunity to identify 
promising drug candidates, but also unveil knowledge regarding TLR signaling 
pathways.
