Fungal genome annotation is the starting point for analysis of genome content. 
This generally involves the application of diverse methods to identify features 
on a genome assembly such as protein-coding and non-coding genes, repeats and 
transposable elements, and pseudogenes. Here we describe tools and methods 
leveraged for eukaryotic genome annotation with a focus on the annotation of 
fungal nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. We highlight the application of the 
latest technologies and tools to improve the quality of predicted gene sets. The 
Broad Institute eukaryotic genome annotation pipeline is described as one 
example of how such methods and tools are integrated into a sequencing center's 
production genome annotation environment.
