BACKGROUND: The common intronic deletion, MYBPC3Δ25, detected in 4% to 8% of 
South Asian populations, is reported to be associated with cardiomyopathy, with 
≈7-fold increased risk of disease in variant carriers. Here, we examine the 
contribution of MYBPC3Δ25 to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in a large 
patient cohort.
METHODS: Sequence data from 2 HCM cohorts (n=5393) was analyzed to determine 
MYBPC3Δ25 frequency and co-occurrence of pathogenic variants in HCM genes. 
Case-control and haplotype analyses were performed to compare variant 
frequencies and assess disease association. Analyses were also undertaken to 
investigate the pathogenicity of a candidate variant MYBPC3 c.1224-52G>A.
RESULTS: Our data suggest that the risk of HCM, previously attributed to 
MYBPC3Δ25, can be explained by enrichment of a derived haplotype, MYBPC3Δ25/-52, 
whereby a small subset of individuals bear both MYBPC3Δ25 and a rare pathogenic 
variant, MYBPC3 c.1224-52G>A. The intronic MYBPC3 c.1224-52G>A variant, which is 
not routinely evaluated by gene panel or exome sequencing, was detected in ≈1% 
of our HCM cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: The MYBPC3 c.1224-52G>A variant explains the disease risk 
previously associated with MYBPC3Δ25 in the South Asian population and is one of 
the most frequent pathogenic variants in HCM in all populations; genotyping 
services should ensure coverage of this deep intronic mutation. Individuals 
carrying MYBPC3Δ25 alone are not at increased risk of HCM, and this variant 
should not be tested in isolation; this is important for the large majority of 
the 100 million individuals of South Asian ancestry who carry MYBPC3Δ25 and 
would previously have been declared at increased risk of HCM.
