BACKGROUND: The aim was to monitor recovery of T/B lymphocytes in baboons after 
depletion by anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and anti-CD20mAb (Rituximab), 
followed by pig kidney transplantation and maintenance therapy with an 
anti-CD40mAb-based regimen.
METHODS: In baboons (n = 14), induction was with ATG and anti-CD20mAb, and 
maintenance with (i) anti-CD40mAb, (ii) rapamycin, and (iii) methylprednisolone. 
Follow-up was for 6 months, or until rejection or other complication developed. 
Baboon blood was collected at intervals to measure T/B cells and subsets by flow 
cytometry. In a separate study in baboons receiving the same immunosuppressive 
regimen (n = 10), the populations of T/B lymphocytes in PBMCs, lymph nodes, and 
spleen were examined.
RESULTS: After induction therapy, the total lymphocyte count and the absolute 
numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+T cells fell by >80%, and no CD22+B cells 
remained (all p < 0.001). T cell numbers began to recover early, but no CD22+B 
cells were present in the blood for 2 months. Recovery of both T and B cells 
remained at <30% of baseline (p < 0.001), even if rejection developed. At 
6 months, effector memory CD8+T cells had increased more than other T cell 
subsets, but a greater percentage of B cells were naïve. In contrast to blood 
and spleen, T and B cells were not depleted in lymph nodes.
CONCLUSIONS: ATG and anti-CD20mAb effectively decreased T and B lymphocytes in 
the blood and, in the presence of anti-CD40mAb maintenance therapy, recovery of 
these cells was inhibited. The recovery of effector memory CD8+T cells may be 
detrimental to long-term graft survival.
