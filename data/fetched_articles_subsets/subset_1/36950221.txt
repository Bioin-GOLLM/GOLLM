The vital cellular functions in Gram-positive bacteria are controlled by 
signaling molecules known as quorum sensing peptides (QSPs), considered 
promising therapeutic interventions for bacterial infections. In the bacterial 
system QSPs bind to membrane-coupled receptors, which then auto-phosphorylate 
and activate intracellular response regulators. These response regulators induce 
target gene expression in bacteria. One of the most reliable trends in drug 
discovery research for virulence-associated molecular targets is the use of 
peptide drugs or new functionalities. In this perspective, computational methods 
act as auxiliary aids for biologists, where methodologies based on machine 
learning and in silico analysis are developed as suitable tools for target 
peptide identification. Therefore, the development of quick and reliable 
computational resources to identify or predict these QSPs along with their 
receptors and inhibitors is receiving considerable attention. The databases such 
as Quorumpeps and Quorum Sensing of Human Gut Microbes (QSHGM) provide a 
detailed overview of the structures and functions of QSPs. The tools and 
algorithms such as QSPpred, QSPred-FL, iQSP, EnsembleQS and PEPred-Suite have 
been used for the generic prediction of QSPs and feature representation. The 
availability of compiled key resources for utilizing peptide features based on 
amino acid composition, positional preferences, and motifs as well as structural 
and physicochemical properties, including biofilm inhibitory peptides, can aid 
in elucidating the QSP and membrane receptor interactions in infectious 
Gram-positive pathogens. Herein, we present a comprehensive survey of diverse 
computational approaches that are suitable for detecting QSPs and QS 
interference molecules. This review highlights the utility of these methods for 
developing potential biomarkers against infectious Gram-positive pathogens.
