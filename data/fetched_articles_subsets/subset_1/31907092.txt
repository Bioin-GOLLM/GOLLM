BACKGROUND: The dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), striatal network dysfunction, 
and visual memory deficits have been consistently reported to be associated with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This study aimed to examine the 
effects of the DAT1 rs27048 (C)/rs429699 (T) haplotype on striatal functional 
connectivity and visual memory performance in youths with ADHD.
METHOD: After excluding those who had excessive head motion, a total of 96 
drug-naïve youths with ADHD and 114 typically developing (TD) youths were 
assessed with the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and the 
delayed matching to sample (DMS) task for visual memory. We examined the effects 
of ADHD, DAT1 CT haplotype, and the ADHD × CT haplotype interaction on the 
functional connectivity of five striatal seeds. We also correlated visual memory 
performance with the functional connectivity of striatal subregions, which 
showed significant diagnosis × genotype interactions.
RESULTS: Compared with TD youths, ADHD youths showed significant 
hypoconnectivity of the left dorsal caudate (DC) with bilateral sensorimotor 
clusters. Significant diagnosis × genotype interactions were found in the 
connectivity between the left DC and the right sensorimotor cluster, and between 
the right DC and the left dorsolateral prefrontal/bilateral anterior cingulate 
clusters. Furthermore, the connectivity of the left DC showing significant 
diagnosis × genotype interactions was associated with DMS performance in youths 
with ADHD who carried the DAT1 CT haplotype.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel gene-brain-behavior association between the left DC 
functional connectivity and visual memory performance in ADHD youths with the 
DAT1 rs27048 (C)/rs429699 (T) haplotype suggests a differential effect of DAT1 
genotype altering specific brain function causing neuropsychological dysfunction 
in ADHD.
