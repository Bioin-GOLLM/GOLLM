Rad51 plays a key role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through 
homologous recombination, which is the central process in the maintenance of 
genomic integrity. Five paralogs of the human Rad51 gene (hRad51) have been 
identified to date, including hRad51B, hRad51C, hRad51D, Xrcc2 and Xrcc3. In 
searches of additional hRad51 paralogs, we identified a novel hRad51 variant 
that lacked the sequence corresponding to exon 9 (hRad51-Deltaex9). The expected 
amino acid sequence of hRad51-Deltaex9 showed a frame-shift at codon 259, which 
resulted in a truncated C-terminus. RT-PCR analysis revealed that both hRad51 
and hRad51-Deltaex9 were prominently expressed in the testis, but that there 
were subtle differences in tissue specificity. The hRad51-Deltaex9 protein was 
detected as a 31-kDa protein in the testis and localized at the nucleus. In 
addition, the hRad51-Deltaex9 protein showed a DNA-strand exchange activity 
comparable to that of hRad51. Taken together, these results indicate that 
hRad51-Deltaex9 promotes homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange in the 
nucleus, suggesting that alternative pathways in hRad51- or 
hRad51-Deltaex9-dependent manners exist for DNA recombination and repair.
