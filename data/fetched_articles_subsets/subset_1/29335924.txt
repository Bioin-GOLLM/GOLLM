PURPOSE: We aimed to establish the spectrum of BRCA1/2 mutations among the 
breast cancer (BC) patients from the Republic of Macedonia.
METHODS: We used targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger DNA 
sequencing, and multiplex ligation probe amplification analysis (MLPA) to search 
for point mutations and deletions/duplications involving BRCA1 and BRCA2-coding 
regions.
RESULTS: We have analyzed a total of 313 BC patients, enriched for family 
history of cancer, early age of onset and bilateral and/or triple negative (TN) 
BC. A total of 26 pathogenic mutations were observed in 49 unrelated BC patients 
(49/313, 15.7%). BRCA2 mutations (27/49, 55.1%) were more common than BRCA1 
mutations (22/49, 44.9%). We identified five novel point mutations, one in BRCA1 
(c.4352_4356delA) and four in BRCA2 (c.151G>T, c.4707_4708delCA, 
c.7811_7814delTGTG, and c.9304_9305delG), as well as two novel deletions 
involving parts of the BRCA1 gene (c.81-?_593+?del and c.5470-?_5530+?del). The 
most common mutations were c.181T>G, c.5266dupC, and c.3700_3704del5 in BRCA1 
and c.7879A>T, c.8317_8330del14 and c.5722_5723delCT in BRCA2 gene. Thus far, 
BRCA2 c.7879A>T and c.8317_8330del14 mutations have been described in several 
isolated cases; however, our study is the first one showing that they have a 
founder effect among Macedonian population. Nine recurrent mutations account for 
65.3% of all of the detected mutations allowing for implementation of a fast 
first-step BRCA1/2 mutational screening strategy in our country.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a comprehensive view of known and novel BRCA1/2 
mutations in BC patients from the Republic of Macedonia and contributes to the 
global spectrum of BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancer.
