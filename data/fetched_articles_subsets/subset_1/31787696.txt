Osimertinib is the standard therapy for epidermal-growth-factor-receptor 
(EGFR)-mutant lung cancers. We herein report a case of osimertinib-induced 
interstitial lung disease (OsiILD) with an organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern and 
provide a literature-based review. Six months after osimertinib administration, 
a 75-year-old woman with right pleural carcinomatosis developed ILD with an OP 
pattern. After salvage chemotherapy, osimertinib with corticosteroid was 
successfully re-administered. A literature review suggested that 1) OsiILD with 
an OP pattern was rare but should be recognized, and 2) re-administration of 
osimertinib in OsiILD was successful in select patients. A criterion that 
determines whether a patient would benefit from re-administration is warranted.
