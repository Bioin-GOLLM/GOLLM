Obesity enhances the risk of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and 
inflammatory conditions and often leads to metal dyshomeostasis, which 
contributes to the negative health aspects associated with the disease. In 
severe cases, bariatric surgery can be recommended to achieve sustained weight 
loss and improvement in health. Here, magnesium, zinc, copper and selenium 
concentrations were examined in 24 obese patients (7 males; 17 females) before 
and 9 months after undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. All patients 
lost weight over this period, with the mean BMI reducing from 51.2±7.1 kg/m2 to 
37.2±5.5 kg/m2. Moreover, whole-blood glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), as a marker 
of average glycaemia, was also measured and a correlative analysis of this 
parameter with metal concentrations performed. Significant alterations in the 
plasma concentrations of magnesium, zinc (both increased by 13.2% and 25.2% 
respectively) and copper (decreased by 7.9%) were observed over this period 
(plasma selenium concentration was unchanged), with BMI values correlating with 
plasma magnesium (p = 0.004) and zinc (p = 0.022) concentrations. At 9 months 
post-surgery, an increase in mean zinc/copper ratio was observed (0.86±0.29 
compared to 0.63±0.14 pre-surgery). Comparison of whole-blood HbA1c 
concentrations pre- and post-surgery revealed a reduction from 6.50±1.28% 
pre-surgery to 5.51±0.49% post-surgery. Differences in plasma HbA1c and 
magnesium at either pre- and post-surgery correlated significantly, as did HbA1c 
and magnesium levels when pre- and post-surgery values were analysed together. 
Collectively, this work reveals that bariatric surgery, in conjunction with 
lifestyle/dietary changes, lead to improvements in the nutritional status of 
magnesium, zinc and copper. Furthermore, the observed improvements in magnesium 
and zinc were associated with weight loss and in the case of magnesium, to 
better glycaemic control.
