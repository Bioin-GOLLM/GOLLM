BACKGROUND/AIM: Osimertinib, a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a highly effective and valuable treatment option 
for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations, 
such as T790M. However, acquired resistance ultimately limits its clinical 
application. In this study, we aimed to identify potential targets for 
overcoming osimertinib resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The H1975/OSI cell line was induced in vitro through 
intermittent induction. Cell activity was measured using a cell counting kit-8 
assay. Uni-omics and multi-omics analyses were conducted on the transcriptomic 
and proteomic (4D label-free) expression profiles, which involved differential 
expression analysis, GO functional annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis, as well as correlation analysis of transcription factors and PPI 
network.
RESULTS: H1975/OSI cells showed resistance towards osimertinib with IC50 values 
approximately 5.25-fold higher than H1975 cells. A total of 2519 genes were 
found to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 1533 proteins were found 
to be differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Furthermore, 147 genes that were 
differentially expressed at both the transcription and protein levels (TPGs) 
were identified as being differentially expressed in both the transcriptome and 
proteome. It was revealed that many pathways related to the structure and 
function of ribosomes, as well as metabolites, were altered. The highest 
connectivity genes of 147 TPGs included NOP56, DDX21, PDCD11, CCNB1, and TOP2A. 
The hub genes of the transcriptional regulatory network included DDX21, KPNA2, 
DDX5, BRCA1, LMNB1, and HIF1A.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, our high-throughput analysis uncovered functional 
properties that interacted with gene signatures of H1975/OSI cells, and 
highlighted certain pathways and eleven hub genes that may be the potential 
targets for improving clinical osimertinib resistance.
