BACKGROUND: Influenza virus spreads infection by two main surface glycoproteins, 
namely hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). NA cleaves the sialic acid 
receptors eventually releasing newly formed virus particles which then invade 
new cells. Inhibition of NA could limit the replication of virus to one round 
which is insufficient to cause the disease.
RESULTS: An experimentally reported series of acylguanidine zanamivir 
derivatives was used to develop GQSAR model targeting NA in different strains of 
influenza virus, H1N1 and H3N2. A combinatorial library was developed and their 
inhibitory activities were predicted using the GQSAR model.
CONCLUSION: The top leads were analyzed by docking which revealed the binding 
modes of these inhibitors in the active site of NA (150-loop). The top compound 
(AMA) was selected for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations for 15 ns 
which provided insights into the time dependent dynamics of the designed leads. 
AMA possessed a docking score of -8.26 Kcal/mol with H1N1 strain and -7.00 
Kcal/mol with H3N2 strain. Ligand-bound complexes of both H1N1 and H3N2 were 
observed to be stable for 11 ns and 7 ns respectively. ADME descriptors were 
also calculated to study the pharmacokinetic properties of AMA which revealed 
its drug-like properties.
