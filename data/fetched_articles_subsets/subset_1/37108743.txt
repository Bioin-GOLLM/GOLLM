Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the most common cause of urinary tract 
infections (UTIs) in hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients. Genomic 
analysis was used to gain further insight into the molecular characteristics of 
UPEC isolates from Saudi Arabia. A total of 165 isolates were collected from 
patients with UTIs between May 2019 and September 2020 from two tertiary 
hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Identification and antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing (AST) were performed using the VITEK system. 
Extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates (n = 48) were selected 
for whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. In silico analysis revealed that the 
most common sequence types detected were ST131 (39.6%), ST1193 (12.5%), ST73 
(10.4%), and ST10 (8.3%). Our finding showed that blaCTX-M-15 gene was detected 
in the majority of ESBL isolates (79.2%), followed by blaCTX-M-27 (12.5%) and 
blaCTX-M-8 (2.1%). ST131 carried blaCTX-M-15 or blaCTX-M-27, and all ST73 and 
ST1193 carried blaCTX-M-15. The relatively high proportion of ST1193 in this 
study was notable as a newly emerged lineage in the region, which warrants 
further monitoring.
