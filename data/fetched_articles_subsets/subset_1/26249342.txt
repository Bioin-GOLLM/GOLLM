A coordinate-based method is presented to detect peptide bonds that need 
correction either by a peptide-plane flip or by a trans-cis inversion of the 
peptide bond. When applied to the whole Protein Data Bank, the method predicts 
4617 trans-cis flips and many thousands of hitherto unknown peptide-plane flips. 
A few examples are highlighted for which a correction of the peptide-plane 
geometry leads to a correction of the understanding of the structure-function 
relation. All data, including 1088 manually validated cases, are freely 
available and the method is available from a web server, a web-service interface 
and through WHAT_CHECK.
