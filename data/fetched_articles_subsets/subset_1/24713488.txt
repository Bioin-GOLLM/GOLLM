PURPOSE: We describe a particular form of autosomal recessive generalized 
choriocapillaris dystrophy phenotype associated with ABCA4 mutations.
METHODS: A cohort of 30 patients with identified ABCA4 mutations and a distinct 
phenotype was studied. A retrospective review of history, fundus photographs, 
electroretinography, visual field testing, dark adaptometry, and optical 
coherence tomography was performed. Genetic analyses were performed by ABCA4 
microarray analysis, high resolution melting, and/or next generation sequencing 
of all protein-coding sequences of the ABCA4 gene.
RESULTS: The earliest recorded manifestation of ABCA4-associated disease was a 
central bull's eye type of macular dystrophy that progressed to chorioretinal 
atrophy of the macula with coarse rounded hyperpigmentations and expanding 
involvement of the periphery. The mean age at first presentation was 10.3 years, 
the longest follow-up was 61 years. All patients had two ABCA4 mutations 
identified, confirming the molecular genetic diagnosis of an ABCA4-associated 
disease. Most patients harbored at least one mutation classified as "severe," 
the most common of which was the p.N965S variant that had been found previously 
at a high frequency among patients with ABCA4-associated retinal dystrophies in 
Denmark.
CONCLUSIONS: Generalized choriocapillaris dystrophy is a progressive 
ABCA4-associated phenotype characterized by early-onset macular dystrophy that 
disperses and expands to widespread end-stage chorioretinal atrophy with 
profound visual loss. All cases in this study were confirmed as harboring two 
ABCA4 mutations. Most of the ABCA4 mutations were classified as "severe" 
explaining the early onset, panretinal degeneration, and fast progression of the 
disease.
