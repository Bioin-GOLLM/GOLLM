Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by increased levels of blood glucose but 
is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease, especially its multiple 
discrete cardiovascular phenotypes. Genetic variations play key roles in the 
heterogeneity of diabetic cardiovascular phenotypes. This study investigates 
possible associations of ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) variants with 
cardiovascular phenotypes among the Chinese patients with T2D. Six hundred 
thirty-six patients with T2D and 634 non-diabetic individuals were analyzed in 
the study. Nine KATP variants were determined by MassARRAY. The KATP rs2285676 
(AA + GA, OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.13-1.81, P = 0.003), rs1799858 (CC, OR = 1.42, 
95% CI: 1.12-1.78, P = 0.004), and rs141294036 (CC, OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 
1.15-1.83, P = 0.002) are associated with increased T2D risk. A follow-up of at 
least 45.8-months (median) indicates further association between the 3 variants 
and risks of diabetic-related cardiovascular conditions. The associations are 
categorized as follows: new-onset/recurrent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
(rs2285676/AA + GA, HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.10-1.70, P = 0.005; rs141294036/TT + 
CT, HR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.28-1.99, P < 0.001), new-onset stroke (rs1799858/CC, HR 
= 2.58, 95% CI: 1.22-5.43, P = 0.013; rs141294036/CC, HR = 2.30, 95% CI: 
1.16-4.55, P = 0.017), new-onset of heart failure (HF) (rs1799858/TT + CT, HR = 
2.78, 95% CI: 2.07-3.74, P < 0.001; rs141294036/TT + CT, HR = 1.45, 95% CI: 
1.07-1.96, P = 0.015), and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (rs1799858/TT + 
CT, HR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.25-3.37, P = 0.004; rs141294036/CC, HR = 2.31, 95% CI: 
1.40-3.82, P = 0.001). In particular, the CC genotype of rs1799858 (OR = 2.38, 
95% CI: 1.11-5.10, P = 0.025) and rs141294036 (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.04-3.66, P = 
0.037) are only associated with the risk of ischemic stroke while its 
counterpart genotype (TT + CT) is associated with the risks of HF with preserved 
ejection fraction (HFpEF) (rs1799858, OR = 3.46, 95% CI: 2.31-5.18, P < 0.001) 
and HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) (rs141294036, OR = 2.74, 
95% CI: 1.05-7.15, P = 0.039). Furthermore, the 3 variants are associated with 
increased risks of abnormal serum levels of triglyceride (TIRG) (≥ 1.70 mmol/L), 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (≥ 1.40 mmol/L), apolipoprotein B 
(ApoB) (≥ 80 mg/dL), apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) level (< 120 mg/dL), 
lipoprotein(a) Lp(a) (≥ 300 mg/dL) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(HsCRP) (≥ 3.0 mg/L) but exhibited heterogeneity (all P < 0.05). The KATP 
rs2285676, rs1799858, and rs141294036 are associated with increased risks of T2D 
and its related cardiovascular phenotypes (ACS, stroke, HF, and AF), but show 
heterogeneity. The 3 KATP variants may be promising markers for diabetic 
cardiovascular events favoring "genotype-phenotype" oriented prevention and 
treatment strategies.
