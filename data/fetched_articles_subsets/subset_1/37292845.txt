The orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR161 is enriched in primary 
cilia, where it plays a central role in suppressing Hedgehog signaling1. GPR161 
mutations lead to developmental defects and cancers2,3,4. The fundamental basis 
of how GPR161 is activated, including potential endogenous activators and 
pathway-relevant signal transducers, remains unclear. To elucidate GPR161 
function, we determined a cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of active 
GPR161 bound to the heterotrimeric G protein complex Gs. This structure revealed 
an extracellular loop 2 that occupies the canonical GPCR orthosteric ligand 
pocket. Furthermore, we identify a sterol that binds to a conserved extrahelical 
site adjacent to transmembrane helices 6 and 7 and stabilizes a GPR161 
conformation required for Gs coupling. Mutations that prevent sterol binding to 
GPR161 suppress cAMP pathway activation. Surprisingly, these mutants retain the 
ability to suppress GLI2 transcription factor accumulation in cilia, a key 
function of ciliary GPR161 in Hedgehog pathway suppression. By contrast, a 
protein kinase A-binding site in the GPR161 C-terminus is critical in 
suppressing GLI2 ciliary accumulation. Our work highlights how unique structural 
features of GPR161 interface with the Hedgehog pathway and sets a foundation to 
understand the broader role of GPR161 function in other signaling pathways.
