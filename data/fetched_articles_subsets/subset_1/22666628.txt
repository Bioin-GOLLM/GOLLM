In Parkinson's disease (PD), alteration of dopamine- (DA-) dependent striatal 
functions and pulsatile stimulation of DA receptors caused by the discontinuous 
administration of levodopa (L-DOPA) lead to a complex cascade of events 
affecting the postsynaptic striatal neurons that might account for the 
appearance of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Experimental models of LID have 
been widely used and extensively characterized in rodents and 
electrophysiological studies provided remarkable insights into the inner 
mechanisms underlying L-DOPA-induced corticostriatal plastic changes. Here we 
provide an overview of recent findings that represent a further step into the 
comprehension of mechanisms underlying maladaptive changes of basal ganglia 
functions in response to L-DOPA and associated to development of LID.
