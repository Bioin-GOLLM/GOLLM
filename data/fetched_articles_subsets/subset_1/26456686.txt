Aging is a major risk factor for many human diseases, and in vitro generation of 
human neurons is an attractive approach for modeling aging-related brain 
disorders. However, modeling aging in differentiated human neurons has proved 
challenging. We generated neurons from human donors across a broad range of 
ages, either by iPSC-based reprogramming and differentiation or by direct 
conversion into induced neurons (iNs). While iPSCs and derived neurons did not 
retain aging-associated gene signatures, iNs displayed age-specific 
transcriptional profiles and revealed age-associated decreases in the nuclear 
transport receptor RanBP17. We detected an age-dependent loss of 
nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization (NCC) in donor fibroblasts and 
corresponding iNs and found that reduced RanBP17 impaired NCC in young cells, 
while iPSC rejuvenation restored NCC in aged cells. These results show that iNs 
retain important aging-related signatures, thus allowing modeling of the aging 
process in vitro, and they identify impaired NCC as an important factor in human 
aging.
