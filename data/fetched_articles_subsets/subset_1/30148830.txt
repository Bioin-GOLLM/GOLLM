The clinical spectrum of ciliopathies affecting motile cilia spans impaired 
mucociliary clearance in the respiratory system, laterality defects including 
heart malformations, infertility and hydrocephalus. Using linkage analysis and 
whole exome sequencing, we identified two recessive loss-of-function MNS1 
mutations in five individuals from four consanguineous families: 1) a homozygous 
nonsense mutation p.Arg242* in four males with laterality defects and 
infertility and 2) a homozygous nonsense mutation p.Gln203* in one female with 
laterality defects and recurrent respiratory infections additionally carrying 
homozygous mutations in DNAH5. Consistent with the laterality defects observed 
in these individuals, we found Mns1 to be expressed in mouse embryonic ventral 
node. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that MNS1 localizes to the 
axonemes of respiratory cilia as well as sperm flagella in human. In-depth 
ultrastructural analyses confirmed a subtle outer dynein arm (ODA) defect in the 
axonemes of respiratory epithelial cells resembling findings reported in 
Mns1-deficient mice. Ultrastructural analyses in the female carrying combined 
mutations in MNS1 and DNAH5 indicated a role for MNS1 in the process of ODA 
docking (ODA-DC) in the distal respiratory axonemes. Furthermore, 
co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two hybrid analyses demonstrated that MNS1 
dimerizes and interacts with the ODA docking complex component CCDC114. Overall, 
we demonstrate that MNS1 deficiency in humans causes laterality defects (situs 
inversus) and likely male infertility and that MNS1 plays a role in the ODA-DC 
assembly.
