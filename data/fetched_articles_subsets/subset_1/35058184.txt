KRAS, the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, was considered 
"undruggable" until the identification of small molecules that bind irreversibly 
to the mutant reactive cysteine at residue 12. Despite the encouraging 
anticancer activity of KRASG12C inhibitors in clinical trials, identification of 
more potent drugs is expected to achieve the maximal clinical benefit, which is 
hindered by the low sensitivity or throughput of current biochemical approaches. 
To overcome these limitations, a biotin-streptavidin-enhanced enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) based on the competitive interaction of 
biotin-labeled probe and the test compound with KRASG12C was developed. Compared 
with reported assays, less protein was used in BA-ELISA, which significantly 
improves the resolution of inhibitor potency, thus contributing to the 
identification of highly potent inhibitors. Furthermore, BA-ELISA can also be 
expanded to determine the cellular potency of the inhibitors using KRASG12C 
mutant living cells. Using three previously disclosed compounds, ARS-1620, AMG 
510, and MRTX849, we demonstrated that BA-ELISA is a highly sensitive, specific, 
and robust method for high-throughput screening of KRASG12C inhibitors.
