iWhale: a computational pipeline based on Docker and SCons for detection and 
annotation of somatic variants in cancer WES data.

Binatti A, Bresolin S, Bortoluzzi S, Coppe A.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a powerful approach for discovering sequence 
variants in cancer cells but its time effectiveness is limited by the complexity 
and issues of WES data analysis. Here we present iWhale, a customizable pipeline 
based on Docker and SCons, reliably detecting somatic variants by three 
complementary callers (MuTect2, Strelka2 and VarScan2). The results are combined 
to obtain a single variant call format file for each sample and variants are 
annotated by integrating a wide range of information extracted from several 
reference databases, ultimately allowing variant and gene prioritization 
according to different criteria. iWhale allows users to conduct a complex series 
of WES analyses with a powerful yet customizable and easy-to-use tool, running 
on most operating systems (macOs, GNU/Linux and Windows). iWhale code is freely 
available at https://github.com/alexcoppe/iWhale and the docker image is 
downloadable from https://hub.docker.com/r/alexcoppe/iwhale.
