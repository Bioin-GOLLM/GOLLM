Controlled differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be utilized 
for precise analysis of cell type identities during early development. We 
established a highly efficient neural induction strategy and an improved 
analytical platform, and determined proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles of 
hESCs and their specified multipotent neural stem cell derivatives (hNSCs). This 
quantitative dataset (nearly 13,000 proteins and 60,000 phosphorylation sites) 
provides unique molecular insights into pluripotency and neural lineage entry. 
Systems-level comparative analysis of proteins (e.g., transcription factors, 
epigenetic regulators, kinase families), phosphorylation sites, and numerous 
biological pathways allowed the identification of distinct signatures in 
pluripotent and multipotent cells. Furthermore, as predicted by the dataset, we 
functionally validated an autocrine/paracrine mechanism by demonstrating that 
the secreted protein midkine is a regulator of neural specification. This 
resource is freely available to the scientific community, including a searchable 
website, PluriProt.
