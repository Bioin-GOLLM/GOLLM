Rewiring of metabolic pathways is a hallmark of tumorigenesis as cancer cells 
acquire novel nutrient dependencies to support oncogenic growth. A major genetic 
subtype of lung adenocarcinoma with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations, which activates the 
endogenous oxidative stress response, undergoes significant metabolic rewiring 
to support enhanced antioxidant production. We demonstrate that cancers with 
high antioxidant capacity exhibit a general dependency on exogenous 
non-essential amino acids (NEAAs) that is driven by the Nrf2-dependent secretion 
of glutamate through system xc- (XCT), which limits intracellular glutamate 
pools that are required for NEAA synthesis. This dependency can be 
therapeutically targeted by dietary restriction or enzymatic depletion of 
individual NEAAs. Importantly, limiting endogenous glutamate levels by 
glutaminase inhibition can sensitize tumors without alterations in the 
Keap1/Nrf2 pathway to dietary restriction of NEAAs. Our findings identify a 
metabolic strategy to therapeutically target cancers with genetic or 
pharmacologic activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway by restricting 
exogenous sources of NEAAs.
