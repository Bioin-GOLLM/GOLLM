Failure of highly purified lysyl hydroxylase to hydroxylate lysyl residues in 
the non-helical regions of collagen.

Royce PM, Barnes MJ.

The activity of highly purified lysyl hydroxylase towards lysyl residues within 
both the helical and the N-terminal non-helical telopeptide regions of chick 
type I collagen has been examined. The peptides alpha 1(I)-CB1 and alpha 
2(I)-CB1, isolated from protocollagen following CNBr digestion and containing 
the N-terminal telopeptidyl lysyl residues, failed themselves to act as 
substrates. With protocollagen as substrate, analysis of products obtained 
following bacterial collagenase digestion of the reaction mixture showed that 
overall 37% hydroxylation of lysyl residues within the helical region of 
collagen had been obtained, which may be maximal. No hydroxylation, however, of 
the single lysyl residue in either alpha 1(I)-CB1 or alpha 2(I)-CB1, isolated 
following CNBr digestion of the reaction mixture, was observed, despite the 
known susceptibility of these residues to hydroxylation. These findings provide 
strong circumstantial evidence for the suggestion that a lysyl hydroxylase 
specific for the telopeptidyl residues and distinct from that active towards 
lysyl residues in the helical portion of the molecule may exist [Barnes, 
Constable, Morton & Royce (1974) Biochem. J. 139, 461-468].
