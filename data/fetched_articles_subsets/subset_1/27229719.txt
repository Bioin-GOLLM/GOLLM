Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a candidate gene for growth 
and carcass traits in regulating animal growth, metabolism and endocrine. It is 
widely expressed in liver, muscle, bone tissues where the IGF-1R functions as a 
factor that promotes cell growth. In this study, the protein expression level of 
IGF-1R gene in liver and muscle tissues of three periods (birth, weaning and 
adult) of three pig breeds (BamaXiang pigs (BM), Tibetan pigs (TM) and Junmu 
No.1 pigs (JM)) were tested by western blot. SNPs within the regulatory region 
of pig IGF-1R gene were detected using direct sequencing and then the genotypes 
were identified through AS-PCR approach. Results showed expression profiles of 
IGF-1R gene between liver and muscle tissues were different and significant 
differences were also found among pig breeds. In the same time, four SNPs were 
detected in the regulatory region of IGF-1R gene, among which the genotype 
frequency of three (g.-1468G > C, g.-1192 C > T and g.330,424 C > T) were 
significantly different among the pig breeds. BM tended to heterozygous (GC/CT) 
of the anterior two loci, while TM and JM preferred the other two homozygotes 
respectively. For the g.330,424 C > T, all pig breeds were tended to be the 
heterozygous. In conclusion, the SNPs with different genotype distribution among 
the three pig breeds may explain the gene expression difference between the 
different pig breeds.
