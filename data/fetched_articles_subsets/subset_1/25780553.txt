BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a complex genetic etiology. Some 
symptoms and mutated genes, including neuroligin (NLGN), neurexin (NRXN), and 
SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein (SHANK), are shared by 
schizophrenia and ASD. Little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of ASD. 
One of the possible molecular pathogenesis is an imbalance of excitatory and 
inhibitory receptors linked with the NLGN-PSD-95-SHANK complex via postsynaptic 
density protein/Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor/zonula occludens-1 
protein (PDZ) binding. In the present study, we focused on GPR85 as a candidate 
gene for ASD because the C-terminal amino acid sequence of GPR85 
[Thr-Cys-Val-Ile (YCVI)] is classified as a type II PDZ-binding motif, and GPR85 
is a risk factor for schizophrenia. GPR85 is an orphan receptor that regulates 
neural and synaptic plasticity and modulates diverse behaviors, including 
learning and memory. While searching for molecules that associate with GPR85, we 
found that GPR85 was associated with postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 
linked with NLGN in the brain.
METHODS: We examined the proteins that associate with the C-terminal sequence of 
GPR85 by pull-down assay and immunoblot analysis and searched for a mutation of 
the GPR85 gene in patients with ASD. We used immunostaining to examine the 
intracellular localization of mutated GPR85 and its influence on the morphology 
of cells and neurons.
RESULTS: The C-terminal sequence of GPR85 interacted with PSD-95 at PDZ1, while 
NLGN interacted with PSD-95 at PDZ3. Two male patients with ASD from independent 
Japanese families possessed inherited missense mutations at conserved sites in 
GPR85: one had T1033C (M152T) and the other had G1239T (V221L). These mutations 
were located in a domain related to G protein interaction and signal 
transduction. In contrast to wild-type GPR85, mutated GPR85 was more 
preferentially accumulated, causing endoplasmic reticulum stress, and disturbed 
the dendrite formation of hippocampal neurons.
CONCLUSIONS: GPR85 associated with the PSD-95 linked with NLGN, which is related 
to ASD. GPR85 carrying the mutations detected in ASD patients disturbed dendrite 
formation that could be the candidate for molecular pathogenesis of ASD through 
the associated NLGN-PSD-95 receptor complex.
