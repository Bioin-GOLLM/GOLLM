Mutations in Sco2, a protein involved in copper trafficking to the terminal 
enzyme of the respiratory chain, cytochrome c oxidase, results in infantile 
hypertrophic cardioencephalomyopathy. We have recently shown that 
copper-histidine (Cu-his) supplementation of Sco2-deficient myoblasts rescues 
COX activity in vitro. Here, we report a patient with SCO 2 mutations and with 
resolution of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Weighing up the evidence, the 
most likely explanation for the improved cardiac function in this patient was 
the subcutaneous application of Cu-his.
