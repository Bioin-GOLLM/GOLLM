BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have greatly improved access 
to diagnosis in endemic countries. Most RDTs detect Plasmodium falciparum 
histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2), but their sensitivity is seriously threatened 
by the emergence of pfhrp2-deleted parasites. RDTs detecting P. falciparum or 
pan-lactate dehydrogenase (Pf- or pan-LDH) provide alternatives. The objective 
of this study was to systematically assess the performance of malaria RDTs 
against well-characterized pfhrp2-deleted P. falciparum parasites.
METHODS: Thirty-two RDTs were tested against 100 wild-type clinical isolates 
(200 parasites/µL), and 40 samples from 10 culture-adapted and clinical isolates 
of pfhrp2-deleted parasites. Wild-type and pfhrp2-deleted parasites had 
comparable Pf-LDH concentrations. Pf-LDH-detecting RDTs were also tested against 
18 clinical isolates at higher density (2,000 parasites/µL) lacking both pfhrp2 
and pfhrp3.
RESULTS: RDT positivity against pfhrp2-deleted parasites was highest (> 94%) for 
the two pan-LDH-only RDTs. The positivity rate for the nine Pf-LDH-detecting 
RDTs varied widely, with similar median positivity between double-deleted 
(pfhrp2/3 negative; 63.9%) and single-deleted (pfhrp2-negative/pfhrp3-positive; 
59.1%) parasites, both lower than against wild-type P. falciparum (93.8%). 
Median positivity for HRP2-detecting RDTs against 22 single-deleted parasites 
was 69.9 and 35.2% for HRP2-only and HRP2-combination RDTs, respectively, 
compared to 96.0 and 92.5% for wild-type parasites. Eight of nine Pf-LDH RDTs 
detected all clinical, double-deleted samples at 2,000 parasites/µL.
CONCLUSIONS: The pan-LDH-only RDTs evaluated performed well. Performance of 
Pf-LDH-detecting RDTs against wild-type P. falciparum does not necessarily 
predict performance against pfhrp2-deleted parasites. Furthermore, many, but not 
all HRP2-based RDTs, detect pfhrp2-negative/pfhrp3-positive samples, with 
implications for the HRP2-based RDT screening approach for detection and 
surveillance of HRP2-negative parasites.
