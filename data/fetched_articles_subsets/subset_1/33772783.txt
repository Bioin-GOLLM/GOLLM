Tauopathies are a group of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders 
characterized by brain deposition of tau inclusions. These insidious disorders 
include Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the two leading causes 
of dementia. Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene 
lead to familial forms of frontotemporal dementia. Previously, we used 
cell-based assays to screen over 20 missense tau mutations and found that 
decreased microtubule (MT) binding affinity was the most shared property. As a 
break from this trend, the MAPT mutations Q336H and Q336R are thought to promote 
MT assembly rather than inhibit it based on in vitro studies. Q336H and Q336R 
MAPT mutations also cause early onset frontotemporal dementia with Pick bodies, 
which are mostly composed of 3R tau isoforms. To provide further insights on the 
pathobiology of these mutations, we assessed Q336H and Q336R tau mutants for 
aggregation propensity and MT binding in cell-based assays in the context of 
both 0N3R and 0N4R tau isoforms. Q336R tau was prone to prion-like seeded 
aggregation but both Q336H and Q336R tau led to increased MT binding. 
Additionally, we found that different tau isoforms with these mutations 
heterogeneously regulate different MT subpopulations of tyrosinated and 
acetylated MTs, markers of newly formed MTs and stable MTs. The Q336H and Q336R 
tau mutations may exemplify an alternative mechanism where pathogenic tau can 
bind MTs with higher affinity and hyperstabilize MTs, which prevent proper MT 
regulation and homeostasis.
