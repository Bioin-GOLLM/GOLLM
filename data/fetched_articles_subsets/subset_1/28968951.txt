Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) splice variants are implicated in prostate cancer 
(PC) progression; however their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We report 
that non-canonical activation of estradiol (E2)-ERβ2 signaling axis primes 
growth, colony-forming ability and migration of the androgen receptor (AR)-null 
castration-resistant PC (CRPC) cells under androgen-deprived conditions (ADC). 
The non-classical E2-ERβ2 mediates phosphorylation and activation of Src-IGF-1R 
complex, which in turn triggers p65-dependent transcriptional upregulation of 
the androgen-regulated serine protease TMPRSS2:ETV5a/TMPRSS2:ETV5b gene fusions 
under ADC. siRNA silencing of TMPRSS2 and/or ETV5 suggests that TMPRSS2:ETV5 
fusions facilitates the E2-ERβ induced growth and migration effects via 
NF-κB-dependent induction of cyclin D1 and MMP2 and MMP9 in PC-3 cells. 
Collectively, our results unravel the functional significance of oncogenic 
TMPRSS2:ETV5 fusions in mediating growth and migration of E2-ERβ2 signaling axis 
in CRPC cells. E2-ERβ2 signaling axis may have significant therapeutic and 
prognostic implications in patients with CRPC.
