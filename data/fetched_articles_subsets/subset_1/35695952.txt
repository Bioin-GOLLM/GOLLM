The amino acid residues lining the substrate binding pocket play quite an 
important role during the lipase catalytic process. The conversion of those 
residues might cause a dramatic change in the lipase properties, such as the 
substrate selectivity of lipase. In our study, T237 residue sitting on the 
entrance of the catalytic pocket in lipase MAS1 was important for the catalytic 
performance. When replacing polar Thr with the positively charged Arg, the 
synthesis ratio of partial glycerides/triglycerides increases to 6.32 rather 
than 1.21 of MAS1 wild type (WT), as the substrate ratio of glycerol and fatty 
acids is 1:3. And the fatty acid preference shifted to long-chain substrates for 
mutant T237R rather than middle-chain substrates for MAS1 WT. Molecular docking 
analysis revealed that hydrophobic and side chain properties of Arg might 
contribute to the change of the MAS1 lipase catalytic performance. This work 
would pave a way for the accurate rational transformation of the lipases to 
produce value lipid for industrial application.
