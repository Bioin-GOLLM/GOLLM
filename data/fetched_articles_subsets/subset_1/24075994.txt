Life is controlled by multiple rhythms. Although the interaction of the daily 
(circadian) clock with environmental stimuli, such as light, is well documented, 
its relationship to endogenous clocks with other periods is little understood. 
We establish that the marine worm Platynereis dumerilii possesses endogenous 
circadian and circalunar (monthly) clocks and characterize their interactions. 
The RNAs of likely core circadian oscillator genes localize to a distinct 
nucleus of the worm's forebrain. The worm's forebrain also harbors a circalunar 
clock entrained by nocturnal light. This monthly clock regulates maturation and 
persists even when circadian clock oscillations are disrupted by the inhibition 
of casein kinase 1δ/ε. Both circadian and circalunar clocks converge on the 
regulation of transcript levels. Furthermore, the circalunar clock changes the 
period and power of circadian behavior, although the period length of the daily 
transcriptional oscillations remains unaltered. We conclude that a second 
endogenous noncircadian clock can influence circadian clock function.
