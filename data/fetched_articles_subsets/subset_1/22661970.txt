RET gene rearrangements (RET/PTCs) represent together with BRAF point mutations 
the two major groups of mutations involved in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) 
initiation and progression. In this review, we will examine the mechanisms 
involved in RET/PTC-induced thyroid cell transformation. In detail, we will 
summarize the data on the molecular mechanisms involved in RET/PTC formation and 
in its function as a dominant oncogene, on the activated signal transduction 
pathways and on the induced gene expression modifications. Moreover, we will 
report on the effects of RET/PTCs on the tumor microenvironment. Finally, a 
short review of the literature on RET/PTC prognostic significance will be 
presented.
