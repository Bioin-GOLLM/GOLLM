Clofarabine (CLO), a purine nucleoside analog with promising efficacy in acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML), inhibits the ribonucleotidereductase, p53R2. We have 
shown that p53R2 mRNA is up-regulated by decitabine (DEC), another drug with 
promising activity in AML. We developed a pharmacodynamic model to characterize 
the interaction between CLO and DEC on an AML cell line and down-regulated p53R2 
protein to understand its role. These results confirm a role for p53R2 in both 
CLO and DEC mechanism of action, demonstrate synergism between these two drugs 
in this AML model and support the use of this combination in a future clinical 
trial.
