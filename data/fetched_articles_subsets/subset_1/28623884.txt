BACKGROUND: Mitogenome diversity is staggering among early branching animals 
with respect to size, gene density, content and order, and number of tRNA genes, 
especially in cnidarians. This last point is of special interest as tRNA 
cleavage drives the maturation of mitochondrial mRNAs and is a primary mechanism 
for mt-RNA processing in animals. Mitochondrial RNA processing in non-bilaterian 
metazoans, some of which possess a single tRNA gene in their mitogenomes, is 
essentially unstudied despite its importance in understanding the evolution of 
mitochondrial transcription in animals.
RESULTS: We characterized the mature mitochondrial mRNA transcripts in a species 
of the octocoral genus Sinularia (Alcyoniidae: Octocorallia), and defined 
precise boundaries of transcription units using different molecular methods. 
Most mt-mRNAs were polycistronic units containing two or three genes and 5' 
and/or 3' untranslated regions of varied length. The octocoral specific, 
mtDNA-encoded mismatch repair gene, the mtMutS, was found to undergo alternative 
polyadenylation, and exhibited differential expression of alternate transcripts 
suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism for this gene. In addition, a long 
noncoding RNA complementary to the ATP6 gene (lncATP6) potentially involved in 
antisense regulation was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Mt-mRNA processing in octocorals possessing a single mt-tRNA is 
complex. Considering the variety of mitogenome arrangements known in cnidarians, 
and in general among non-bilaterian metazoans, our findings provide a first 
glimpse into the complex mtDNA transcription, mt-mRNA processing, and regulation 
among early branching animals and represent a first step towards understanding 
its functional and evolutionary implications.
