To perform a meta-analysis investigating the association of MTHFR C677T 
polymorphism and susceptibility of cervical cancer. All case-control studies 
published in English and Chinese with estimates of the relationship between 
MTHFR C677T polymorphism and risk of cervical cancer were analyzed using odds 
ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI). A total of 10 studies (2,023 
cases and 2,570 controls) were included in the meta-analysis. No significant 
association was observed between T allele and C allele (OR = 0.90; 95 %CI = 
0.70-1.17; P = 0.43), and for genotype TT versus CC (OR = 1.09; 95 %CI = 
0.74-1.61; P = 0.67), CT versus CC (OR = 0.95; 95 %CI = 0.75-1.20; P = 0.65), CT 
+ TT versus CC (OR = 0.91; 95 %CI = 0.66-1.24; P = 0.55). The current 
meta-analysis results suggest that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism may not be 
associated with cervical cancer.
