Jaundice, the clinical hallmark of infection-associated liver dysfunction, 
reflects altered membrane organization of the canalicular pole of hepatocytes 
and portends poor outcomes. Mice lacking phosphoinositide 3-kinase-γ (PI3Kγ) are 
protected against membrane disintegration and hepatic excretory dysfunction. 
However, they exhibit a severe immune defect that hinders neutrophil recruitment 
to sites of infection. To exploit the therapeutic potential of PI3Kγ inhibition 
in sepsis, a targeted approach to deliver drugs to hepatic parenchymal cells 
without compromising other cells, in particular immune cells, seems warranted. 
Here, we demonstrate that nanocarriers functionalized through DY-635, a 
fluorescent polymethine dye, and a ligand of organic anion transporters can 
selectively deliver therapeutics to hepatic parenchymal cells. Applying this 
strategy to a murine model of sepsis, we observed the PI3Kγ-dependent 
restoration of biliary canalicular architecture, maintained excretory liver 
function, and improved survival without impairing host defense mechanisms. This 
strategy carries the potential to expand targeted nanomedicines to disease 
entities with systemic inflammation and concomitantly impaired barrier 
functionality.
