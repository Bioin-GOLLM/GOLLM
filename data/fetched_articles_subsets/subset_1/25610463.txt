This study demonstrates the capacity of HM-γ-PGA treatment to significantly 
protect murine macrophage cells (RAW 264.7 cells) against NDV infection. Such 
protection can be explained by the induction of antiviral state of HM-γ-PGA in 
RAW 264.7 cells via TLR4-mediated IRF-3, IRF-7, IFN-β, and IFN-related gene 
induction as shown in time-dependent changes in mRNA expression confirmed by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, the present research also showed that 
HM-γ-PGA can induce proinflammatory cytokine secretion in RAW 264.7 as measured 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Therefore, our findings suggest 
that HM-γ-PGA can be a potential antiviral substance that can inhibit NDV 
infection through its stimulation of antiviral state on RAW 264.7 cells. These 
results have been consistent with the previous studies showing that HM-γ-PGA can 
protect RAW 264.7 cells and mice against influenza infection. However, it should 
be noted that although murine macrophage cells are susceptible to NDV, they are 
not the natural host cells of the virus; thus further in vivo and in vitro 
studies involving chicken and chicken immune cells are needed to fully assess 
the efficacy and applicability of HM-γ-PGA in the poultry industry.
