The abnormal phosphorylation of tau is a necessary precursor to the formation of 
tau fibrils, a marker of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesize that 
hyperphosphorylative conditions may result in unique cell surface markers. We 
identify and demonstrate the utility of such surrogate markers to identify the 
hyperphosphorylative state. Methods: Cell SELEX was used to identify novel 
thioaptamers specifically binding hyperphosphorylative cells. Cell surface 
vimentin was identified as a potential binding target of the aptamer. Novel 
molecular magnetic resonance imaging (M-MRI) probes using these aptamers and a 
small molecule ligand to vimentin were used for in vivo detection of this 
pre-pathological state. Results: In a mouse model of pathological tau, we 
demonstrated in vivo visualization of the hyperphosphorylative state by M-MRI, 
enabling the identification at a pre-pathological stage of mice that develop 
frank tau pathology several months later. In vivo visualization of the 
hyperphosphorylative state by M-MRI was further validated in a second mouse 
model (APP/PS1) of Alzheimer's disease again identifying the mutants at a 
pre-pathological stage. Conclusions: M-MRI of the hyperphosphorylative state 
identifies future tau pathology and could enable extremely early-stage diagnosis 
of Alzheimer's disease, at a pre-patholgical stage.
