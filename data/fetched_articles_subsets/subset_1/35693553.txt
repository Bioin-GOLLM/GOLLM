In recent years, variants in the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the kinase 
CK2 have been found to underlie two different, yet symptomatically overlapping 
neurodevelopmental disorders, termed Okur-Chung neurodevelopmental syndrome 
(OCNDS) and Poirier-Bienvenu neurodevelopmental syndrome (POBINDS). Both 
conditions are predominantly caused by de novo missense or nonsense mono-allelic 
variants. They are characterized by a generalized developmental delay, 
intellectual disability, behavioral problems (hyperactivity, repetitive 
movements and social interaction deficits), hypotonia, motricity and 
verbalization deficits. One of the main features of POBINDS is epilepsies, which 
are present with much lower prevalence in patients with OCNDS. While a role for 
CK2 in brain functioning and development is well acknowledged, these findings 
for the first time clearly link CK2 to defined brain disorders. Our review will 
bring together patient data for both syndromes, aiming to link symptoms with 
genotypes, and to rationalize the symptoms through known cellular functions of 
CK2 that have been identified in preclinical and biochemical contexts. We will 
also compare the symptomatology and elaborate the specificities that distinguish 
the two syndromes.
