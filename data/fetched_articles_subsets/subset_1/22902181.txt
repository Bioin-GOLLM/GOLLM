In normal and diseased vascular smooth muscle (SM), the RhoA pathway, which is 
activated by multiple agonists through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), 
plays a central role in regulating basal tone and peripheral resistance. 
Multiple RhoA GTP exchange factors (GEFs) are expressed in SM, raising the 
possibility that specific agonists coupled to specific GPCRs may couple to 
distinct RhoGEFs and provide novel therapeutic targets. This review focuses on 
the function and mechanisms of activation of p63RhoGEF (Arhgef 25; GEFT) 
recently identified in SM and its possible role in selective targeting of 
RhoA-mediated regulation of basal blood pressure through agonists that couple 
through G(αq/11).
