Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an emerging complication of diabetes 
associated with an increasing use of sodium-glucose transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) 
inhibitor drugs. This review highlights the growing incidence of EDKA and its 
diagnostic challenges due to the absence of hallmark hyperglycemia seen in 
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The paper presents a classification system for the 
severity of EDKA, categorizing it into mild, moderate, and severe based on serum 
pH and bicarbonate levels. Another classification system is proposed to define 
stages of EDKA based on anion gap and ketones at the time of diagnosis and 
during the treatment period. A treatment algorithm is proposed to guide 
clinicians in managing EDKA. This treatment algorithm includes monitoring anion 
gap and ketones to guide insulin and fluid management, and slower transition to 
subcutaneous insulin to prevent a relapse. Increased awareness of EDKA is 
essential for a timely diagnosis because an early diagnosis and treatment can 
improve clinical outcomes.
