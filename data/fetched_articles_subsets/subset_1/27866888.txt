Primary and motile cilia/flagella function as cellular antennae, receiving 
signals from the environment and subsequently activating signaling pathways that 
are critical for cellular homeostasis and differentiation [1-3]. Recent work 
with the green alga Chlamydomonas and the nematode C. elegans demonstrated that 
ectosomes can be released from the cilium and can mediate the intercellular 
communication [4-9]. To better understand the function of flagellar ectosomes, 
we have compared their protein composition to that of the flagellar membrane 
from which they are derived. Ectosomes released from flagella have a unique 
protein composition, being enriched in a subset of flagellar membrane proteins, 
proteases, proteins from the endosomal sorting complex required for transport 
(ESCRT) [10-12], small GTPases, and ubiquitinated proteins. Live imaging showed 
that an ESCRT-related protein (PDCD6) was enriched in ectosomes released from 
flagella during gamete activation. We devised a sensitive and rapid assay to 
monitor ectosome release using luciferase fused to PDCD6 and a mutated 
ubiquitin. Ectosome release increased when cells underwent flagellar resorption. 
Knockdown of two ESCRT-related proteins, PDCD6 and VPS4, attenuated ectosome 
release during flagellar shortening and shortening was slowed. These data 
suggest that the ESCRT proteins mediate ectosome release and thereby influence 
flagellar shortening in Chlamydomonas. In addition, the prevalence of receptors 
such as agglutinin and ubiquitinated proteins in ciliary ectosomes suggests that 
they are involved in cell signaling and turnover of ciliary proteins.
