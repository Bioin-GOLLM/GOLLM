BRCA1 mutation research in ovarian and breast cancer 17q21-linked families has 
yielded a large number of germline sequence variations. Somatic mutations have 
been uncommonly reported. We screened 81 probands with primary ovarian, 
peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma for BRCA1 mutations. The study group was 
intentionally biased by the inclusion of 29 probands with a family history of 
ovarian and/or breast carcinoma, 13 probands diagnosed on or before age 45, 
seven individuals with a metachronous breast cancer and 51 tumors with BRCA1 
LOH. Tumor and/or germline DNA was screened by modified techniques of 
single-strand confirmation polymorphism analysis, and abnormal banding patterns 
were sequenced to confirm mutations. Twenty-one (25.9%) BRCA1 sequence 
variations were identified. Eight mutations were somatic including seven null 
mutations. Apart from classical hereditary ovarian/breast cancer, a family 
history of ovarian/breast cancer defines a subset of ovarian cancer individuals 
with a significant likelihood of either a germline or a somatic BRCA1 gene 
sequence variation.
