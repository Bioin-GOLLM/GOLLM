In the title compound, C(18)H(16)N(2)O(3), a potential inhibitor of the 
cyclo-oxygenase-2 isoenzyme, the pyrazoline ring exists in a flattened envelope 
conformation with one C atom deviating by 0.463 Å from the mean plane of the 
remaining four atoms. The puckering of the central oxazine ring is more severe, 
with one N atom and one C atom displaced by 0.235 (6) and 0.370 (2) Å, 
respectively, on opposite sides of the mean plane defined by the other four 
atoms; the conformation is that of a half-chair. As a result, the mol-ecule as a 
whole is not planar. The carboxyl group is involved in an inter-molecular O-H⋯N 
hydrogen bond, which links the mol-ecules into centrosymmetric dimers.
