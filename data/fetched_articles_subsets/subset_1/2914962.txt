A methotrexate (MTX)-resistant human colon carcinoma cell line was obtained by 
growing HCT-8 cells in stepwise increasing concentrations of the drug. The 
resistant subline (HCT-8R4) was able to grow in the presence of 1 x 10(-4) M MTX 
and was found to have a 25-fold increase in the level of the target enzyme 
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), with a corresponding increase in DHFR gene 
copies as well as DHFR transcripts. Southern blot analysis of DNA from HCT-8R4 
cells revealed the amplification of an altered gene. The amplified DHFR gene 
lacks an EcoRI restriction enzyme site in the coding region, normally present in 
other human cell lines. Sequence analysis of cDNA synthesized from transcripts 
in the MTX-resistant cell line revealed a base transition T----C at nucleotide 
position 91 resulting in a substitution of serine for phenylalanine. The 
dissociation constant for MTX binding to the HCT-8R4 enzyme was 1.25 nM, an 
8-fold increase from the Kd 150 pM of purified wild type human DHFR. This 
decrease in binding of MTX to the HCT-8R4 DHFR is consistent with the predicted 
involvement of phenylalanine in the DHFR active site in hydrophobic interactions 
with MTX. This mutation plus the 25-fold increase in DHFR activity explains the 
high level of resistance of this subline to MTX.
