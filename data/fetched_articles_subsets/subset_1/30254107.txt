Plants have evolved complex photoreceptor-controlled mechanisms to sense and 
respond to seasonal changes in day length. This ability allows plants to 
optimally time the transition from vegetative growth to flowering. UV-B is an 
important part intrinsic to sunlight; however, whether and how it affects 
photoperiodic flowering has remained elusive. Here, we report that, in the 
presence of UV-B, genetic mutation of REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 2 
(RUP2) renders the facultative long day plant Arabidopsis thaliana a day-neutral 
plant and that this phenotype is dependent on the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) 
UV-B photoreceptor. We provide evidence that the floral repression activity of 
RUP2 involves direct interaction with CONSTANS, repression of this key activator 
of flowering, and suppression of FLOWERING LOCUS T transcription. RUP2 therefore 
functions as an essential repressor of UVR8-mediated induction of flowering 
under noninductive short day conditions and thus provides a crucial mechanism of 
photoperiodic flowering control.
