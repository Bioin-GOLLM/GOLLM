BACKGROUND: Gut hormones and their receptors are considered important in the 
control of feeding behavior. The gut hormone peptide-YY (PYY) has anorexic 
effects via the inhibitory neuropeptide Y2 receptor (Y2R) highly expressed in 
orexigenic NPY/AGRP neurons within the arcuate nucleus, a major integrator of 
appetite control in the hypothalamus.
DESIGN: Genetic case-control association study of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in Y2R and PYY.
SUBJECTS: Swedish Caucasians comprising 148 lean, 129 overweight/obese and 226 
morbidly obese men.
MEASUREMENTS: Genotypes of the common, silent and conserved SNP Y2R 585T>C and 
the common SNP PYY Arg72Thr, as well as various obesity-related clinical 
parameters.
RESULTS: Obese men had a lower allele and homozygosity frequency of the common 
allele 585T>C:T which was particularly evident comparing morbidly obese with 
lean men (P = 0.002), and analyzing dependence between continuous body mass 
index (BMI) and genotype (P = 0.002). In agreement, systolic blood pressure 
tended to be lower in those homozygous for allele T, which was not explained by 
the BMI - genotype dependence. We found no association to obesity for the PYY 
Arg72Thr polymorphism, which is located nearby the essential carboxy terminal.
CONCLUSION: A common and conserved variant of the PYY and NPY receptor Y2R is 
less prevalent among obese compared to among lean Swedish men. This suggests 
that the common Y2R variant is protective against obesity. Our findings further 
implicate Y2R in food intake regulation.
