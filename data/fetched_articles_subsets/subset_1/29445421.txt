BACKGROUND: Nijmegen breakage syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by microcephaly, immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to 
X-irradiation, and a high predisposition to cancer. Nibrin, the product of the 
NBN gene, is part of the MRE11/RAD50 (MRN) complex that is involved in the 
repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and plays a critical role in the 
processing of DSBs in immune gene rearrangements, telomere maintenance, and 
meiotic recombination. NBS skin fibroblasts grow slowly in culture and enter 
early into senescence.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present an incidental finding. Skin fibroblasts, 
derived from a 9 year old NBS patient, showed a mosaic of normal diploid cells 
(46,XY) and those with a complex, unbalanced translocation. The aberrant 
karyotype was analysed by G-banding, comparative genomic hybridization, and 
whole chromosome painting. The exact breakpoints of the derivative chromosome 
were mapped by whole genome sequencing: 
45,XY,der(6)(6pter → 6q11.1::13q11 → 13q21.33::20q11.22 → 20qter),-13. The 
deleted region of chromosomes 6 harbors almost 1.400 and that of chromosome 13 
more than 500 genes, the duplicated region of chromosome 20 contains about 700 
genes. Such unbalanced translocations are regularly incompatible with cellular 
survival, except in malignant cells. The aberrant cells, however, showed a high 
proliferation potential and could even be clonally expanded. Telomere length was 
significantly reduced, hTERT was not expressed. The cells underwent about 50 
population doublings until they entered into senescence. The chromosomal 
preparation performed shortly before senescence showed telomere fusions, 
premature centromere divisions, endoreduplications and tetraploid cells, 
isochromatid breaks and a variety of marker chromosomes. Inspection of the site 
of skin biopsy 18 years later, presented no evidence for abnormal growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The aberrant cells had a significant selective advantage in vitro. 
It is therefore tempting to speculate that this highly unbalanced translocation 
could be a primary driver of cancer cell growth.
