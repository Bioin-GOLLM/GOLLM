INTRODUCTION: Beta-2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) is present in the cells of the 
respiratory tract, including bronchial smooth muscle cells and bronchial 
epithelium, and is a target for endogenous catecholamines and drugs used to 
treat the obstructive lung diseases.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the possible association of the 
Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms of the ADRB2 gene with asthma and its 
endophenotypes in the Kazakh population.
METHODS: A total of 70 asthmatic patients and 80 healthy controls were genotyped 
for Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu polymorphisms of the ADRB2 gene by using quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical analysis was performed with the 
Graph Pad InStat 7 Software.
RESULTS: No associations between the asthma patients and healthy individuals 
were found when the allele and genotype distribution of Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu 
single nucleotide polymorphisms were compared. Analysis of the haplotype 
frequencies showed statistically significant differences between patients with 
asthma and controls for Arg16Gly/Gln27Gln and Arg16Gly/Gln27Glu haplotypes (odds 
ratio [OR] = 2.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-5.16 and OR = 2.25, 95% 
CI = 0.89-5.67 respectively). The Arg16 allele and Arg16Arg genotype frequencies 
were higher in patients with uncontrolled asthma than in controls (χ2 = 5.17, df 
= 1, P = 0.02 and χ2 = 5.36, df = 1, P = 0.02 respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the possible involvement of 
Arg16Gly polymorphism in the development of uncontrolled asthma, and indicate 
that Arg16Gly/Gln27Gln and Arg16Gly/Gln27Glu haplotypes are more common in 
asthma patients in the Kazakh population.
