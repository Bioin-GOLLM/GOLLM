Purinergic P2 receptors are a class of plasma membrane receptors that are 
express in many tissues and are ligated by extracellular nucleotides [such as 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), uridine 
5'-triphosphate (UTP) and uridine 5'-diphosphate (UDP)], which are released as a 
consequence of cell damage, cell stress, bacterial infection or other noxious 
stimuli. According to the molecular structure, P2 receptors are divided into two 
subfamilies: P2X and P2Y receptors. The P2X receptors are ligand-gated channels, 
whereas P2Y receptors are G-protein-coupled seven-membrane-spanning receptors. 
Several studies indicate that nucleotides play an important role in immune 
response modulation through their action on multiple cell types, including 
monocytes, mast cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Recent 
work by our group and others identified extracellular nucleotides as chemotaxins 
for various human immune cells, including eosinophils, neutrophils and dendritic 
cells. In this review, we summarise recent findings in this field and put 
forward a hypothesis on the role of P2 receptors in the early recruitment of 
human immune cells to the site of inflammation.
