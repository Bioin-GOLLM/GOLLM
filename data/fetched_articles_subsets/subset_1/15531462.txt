Elevated thrombopoietin levels and alterations in the sequence of its receptor, 
c-Mpl, in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

Pospisilova D, Cmejlova J, Slavik L, Cmejla R.

In the study of the possible thrombopoietin (TPO)-c-Mpl pathway involvement in 
the pathogenesis of Diamond-Blackfan anemia, repeatedly increased serum TPO 
levels were identified in 7/14 patients and changes in c-mpl sequence in 3/14 
patients. While elevated TPO levels can represent a compensatory mechanism for 
impaired erythropoiesis, c-Mpl mutations could influence the disease severity.
