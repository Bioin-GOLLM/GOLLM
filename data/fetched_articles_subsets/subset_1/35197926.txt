BACKGROUND: MicroRNA (miRNA) has been reported to play a critical regulatory 
role in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). However, the role of miR-221/222 in 
PTC remains unclear. Here, we performed this study to explore the diagnostic 
potentials and mechanisms of miR-221/222 in PTC.
METHODS: First, we systematically analyzed the diagnostic value of miR-221/222 
in the diagnosis PTC by pooling the published studies. Afterwards, we performed 
comprehensive bioinformatics analysis including gene ontology analysis, pathway 
enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis to explore the 
potential mechanisms of miR-221/222 involved in PTC.
RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of miR-221/222 for PTC were 
0.75 (95% CI: 0.70-0.80) and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.76-0.84) respectively with the AUC 
of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81-0.88). The diagnostic performance varied among different 
subgroups including geographical locations, sample sources and sample sizes. 
Meanwhile, we found that a combination of miR-221/222 and other miRNAs when used 
in a diagnostic panel could improve the diagnostic accuracy than individual 
miR-221/222. Moreover, through the bioinformatics analysis, we confirmed that 
miR-221/222 targets were highly related to the molecular pathogenesis of PTC. 
The results revealed that miR-221/222 may exert important functions in PTC 
through thyroid hormone signaling pathway and some other key pathways by 
regulating some key genes.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that miR-221/222 have the potential to 
serve as auxiliary tools for diagnosing PTC. Further prospective clinical trials 
should be performed to assess the accuracy of these findings in a larger cohort 
and determine the clinical uses.
