OBJECTIVES: Curcumin protects the liver against injury and fibrosis through 
suppressing hepatic inflammation, attenuating hepatic oxidative stress (OS), and 
inhibiting hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation. Non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are considered as common 
metabolic disorders. Low-grade chronic inflammation with different markers, such 
as elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, play a 
crucial role in PCOS. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects of 
curcumin on IL-6 and CRP levels as well as insulin resistance (IR) index on 
liver function in PCOS rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, 90 adult Wistar rats were 
divided into control (n=18), sham (n=18), PCOS (n=18) and curcumin-treated PCOS 
groups (n=36). PCOS group was injected subcutaneously with 2 mg 
estradio-valerate (E2V). After 60 days, PCOS group was treated with curcumin 
[100 and 300 mg/kg body weight (BW)] for 14 days and anesthetized by chloroform. 
Blood and liver samples were collected for histological and serological 
analyses. Data were analyzed using In-Stat 3 via one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA).
RESULTS: Histological and serological analyses showed a reduction in number of 
necrotic cells, IR index, as well as IL-6 and CRP levels in PCOS rats that were 
treated with various concentrations of curcumin.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, curcumin decreased liver inflammation by induction 
of insulin sensitivity and reduction of hepatic necrosis. Therefore, curcumin 
may be considered as protective factor against inflammatory state of PCOS.
