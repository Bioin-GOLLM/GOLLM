BACKGROUND: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), affected 
collectively by genetic and environmental factors, is the common subtype of 
chronic heart failure. Although the available risk assessment methods for HFpEF 
have achieved some progress, they were based on clinical or genetic features 
alone. Here, we have developed a deep learning framework, HFmeRisk, using both 5 
clinical features and 25 DNA methylation loci to predict the early risk of HFpEF 
in the Framingham Heart Study Cohort.
RESULTS: The framework incorporates Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator and Extreme Gradient Boosting-based feature selection, as well as a 
Factorization-Machine based neural network-based recommender system. Model 
discrimination and calibration were assessed using the AUC and Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test. HFmeRisk, including 25 CpGs and 5 clinical features, have achieved the AUC 
of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.92) and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was 
6.17 (P = 0.632), which outperformed models with clinical characteristics or DNA 
methylation levels alone, published chronic heart failure risk prediction models 
and other benchmark machine learning models. Out of them, the DNA methylation 
levels of two CpGs were significantly correlated with the paired transcriptome 
levels (R < -0.3, P < 0.05). Besides, DNA methylation locus in HFmeRisk were 
associated with intercellular signaling and interaction, amino acid metabolism, 
transport and activation and the clinical variables were all related with the 
mechanism of occurrence of HFpEF. Together, these findings give new evidence 
into the HFmeRisk model.
CONCLUSION: Our study proposes an early risk assessment framework for HFpEF 
integrating both clinical and epigenetic features, providing a promising path 
for clinical decision making.
