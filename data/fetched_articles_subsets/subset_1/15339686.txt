Genetic studies suggest a novel Portuguese origin for hemoglobin Porto Alegre.

Molecular studies performed in Portuguese and Brazilian cases of hemoglobin 
Porto Alegre [beta9 Ser->Cys] revealed that the mutation is in association with 
the Mediterranean haplotype I and framework 1 and that it is also in cis with an 
undescribed intragenic polymorphism (codon 27, GCC->GCT). Based upon these 
findings, and reinforced by historical data, we suggest that hemoglobin Porto 
Alegre originated from a single mutational event in the Portuguese population 
and was then spread to South America, namely to Brazil.
