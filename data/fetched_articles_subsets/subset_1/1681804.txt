formation.

beta-Amyloid (A beta) deposition in fibril form is the central event in a number 
of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and hereditary cerebral 
hemorrhage with amyloidosis - Dutch type (HCHWA-D). A beta is produced by 
degradation of a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recently a mutation in 
the APP gene has been found in HCHWA-D causing a glutamine for glutamic acid 
substitution at residue 22 of A beta. The influence of this mutation on 
fibrillogenesis is not known, although it is clear that affected patients have 
accelerated cerebrovascular amyloid deposition, with disease symptoms early in 
life. We report the in vitro demonstration of accelerated fibril formation in a 
28 residue synthetic peptide homologous to the Dutch variant A beta. 
Furthermore, in eight residue peptides homologous to A beta the presence of the 
mutation is necessary for fibril formation. These findings provide a mechanism 
for accelerated amyloid formation in the Dutch variant of APP.
