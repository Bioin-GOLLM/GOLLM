Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited disorders affecting 1 in 
3000-7000 people and characterized by abnormalities of the photoreceptors (rods 
and cones) or the retinal pigment epithelium of the retina which lead to 
progressive visual loss. RP can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal 
recessive or X-linked manner. While usually limited to the eye, RP may also 
occur as part of a syndrome as in the Usher syndrome and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. 
Over 40 genes have been associated with RP so far, with the majority of them 
expressed in either the photoreceptors or the retinal pigment epithelium. The 
tremendous heterogeneity of the disease makes the genetics of RP complicated, 
thus rendering genotype-phenotype correlations not fully applicable yet. In 
addition to the multiplicity of mutations, in fact, different mutations in the 
same gene may cause different diseases. We will here review which genes are 
involved in the genesis of RP and how mutations can lead to retinal 
degeneration. In the future, a more thorough analysis of genetic and clinical 
data together with a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation 
might allow to reveal important information with respect to the likelihood of 
disease development and choices of therapy.
