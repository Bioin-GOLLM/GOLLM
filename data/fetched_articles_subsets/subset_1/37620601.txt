The myeloid neoplasms encompass acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic 
syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Most cases arise from the shared 
ancestor of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Here we analyze data from 454,340 UK 
Biobank participants, of whom 1,808 developed a myeloid neoplasm 0-15 years 
after recruitment. We describe the differences in CH mutational landscapes and 
hematology/biochemistry test parameters among individuals that later develop 
myeloid neoplasms (pre-MN) versus controls, finding that disease-specific 
changes are detectable years before diagnosis. By analyzing differences between 
'pre-MN' and controls, we develop and validate Cox regression models quantifying 
the risk of progression to each myeloid neoplasm subtype. We construct 
'MN-predict', a web application that generates time-dependent predictions with 
the input of basic blood tests and genetic data. Our study demonstrates that 
many individuals that develop myeloid neoplasms can be identified years in 
advance and provides a framework for disease-specific prognostication that will 
be of substantial use to researchers and physicians.
