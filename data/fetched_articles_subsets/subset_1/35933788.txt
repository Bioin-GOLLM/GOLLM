The past fifty years have been marked by the surge of neurodegenerative 
diseases. Unfortunately, current treatments are only symptomatic. Hence, the 
search for new and innovative therapeutic targets for curative treatments 
becomes a major challenge. Among these targets, the adenosine A2A receptor 
(A2AAR) has been the subject of much research in recent years. In this paper, we 
report the design, synthesis and pharmacological analysis of quinazoline 
derivatives as A2AAR antagonists with high ligand efficiency. This class of 
molecules has been discovered by a virtual screening and bears no structural 
semblance with reference antagonist ZM-241385. More precisely, we identified a 
series of 2-aminoquinazoline as promising A2AAR antagonists. Among them, one 
compound showed a high affinity towards A2AAR (21a, Ki = 20 nM). We crystallized 
this ligand in complex with A2AAR, confirming one of our predicted docking poses 
and opening up possibilities for further optimization to derive selective 
ligands for specific adenosine receptor subtypes.
