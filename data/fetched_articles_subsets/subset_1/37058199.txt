PURPOSE: Periodontitis and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) share risk factors and 
activate similar immunopathological pathways, intensifying systemic 
inflammation. This study investigated the clinical, immunological and 
microbiological parameters in individuals with COVID-19 and controls, exploring 
whether periodontitis-driven inflammation contributes to worsening COVID-19 
endpoints.
METHODS: Case (positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2) and control (negative RT-PCR) 
individuals underwent clinical and periodontal assessments. Salivary levels of 
TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, OPG, RANKL, neutrophil extracellular traps, and 
subgingival biofilm were analyzed at two timepoints. Data on COVID-19-related 
outcomes and comorbidity information were evaluated from medical records.
RESULTS: Ninety-nine cases of COVID-19 and 182 controls were included for 
analysis. Periodontitis was associated with more hospitalization (p = 0.009), 
more days in the intensive care unit (ICU) (p = 0.042), admission to the 
semi-ICU (p = 0.047), and greater need for oxygen therapy (p = 0.042). After 
adjustment for confounders, periodontitis resulted in a 1.13-fold increase in 
the chance of hospitalization. Salivary IL-6 levels (p = 0.010) were increased 
in individuals with COVID-19 and periodontitis. Periodontitis was associated 
with increased RANKL and IL-1β after COVID-19. No significant changes were 
observed in the bacterial loads of the periodontopathogens Porphyromona 
gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tanerella forsythia, and 
Treponema denticola.
CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis was associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, 
suggesting the relevance of periodontal care to reduce the burden of overall 
inflammation. Understanding the crosstalk between SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
chronic conditions such as periodontitis that can influence disease outcome is 
important to potentially prevent complications of COVID-19.
