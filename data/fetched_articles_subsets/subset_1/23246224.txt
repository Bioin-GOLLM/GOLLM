OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that patients with bisphosphonate (BP)-related 
osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) accumulate higher levels of BP in bone than 
those without BRONJ.
STUDY DESIGN: Using the Pmetrics package and published data, we designed a 
population pharmacokinetic model of pamidronate concentration in plasma and bone 
and derived a toxic bone BP threshold of 0.2 mmol/L. With the model, and using 
patient individual BP duration and bone mineral content estimated from lean body 
weight, we calculated bone BP levels in 153 subjects.
RESULTS: Mean bone BP in 69 BRONJ cases was higher than in 84 controls (0.20 vs 
0.10 mmol/L, P < 0.001), consistent with the toxic bone threshold of 0.2 mmol/L. 
BRONJ was also associated with longer duration BP therapy (5.3 vs 2.7 years, P < 
0.001), older age (76 vs 70 years, P < 0.001), and Asian race (49% vs 14%, P < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our model accurately discriminated BRONJ cases from controls among 
patients on BP therapy.
