Cis-acting RNA structures in the genomes of RNA viruses play critical roles in 
viral infection, yet their importance in the bipartite genomes of the 
picorna-like, plant-infecting comoviruses has not been carefully investigated. 
We previously characterized SLC, a stem-loop structure in the 5' untranslated 
region (UTR) of the bean pod mottle comovirus (BPMV) RNA2, and found it to be 
essential for RNA2 accumulation in infected cells. Here we report the 
identification of SL1, a similar cis-acting element in the other BPMV genome 
segment - RNA1. SL1 encompasses a portion of RNA1 5' UTR but extends into the 
coding sequence for nine nucleotides, thus was missed in the previous study. 
While the stems of SL1 and SLC share little sequence similarity, their end loops 
are of the same size and identical for 11 of 15 nucleotides. Importantly, SL1 
and SLC are functionally interchangeable, and separate exchanges of the stem and 
loop portions were likewise well tolerated. By contrast, the conserved loop 
sequence tolerated minimal perturbations. Finally, stem-loop structures with 
similar configurations were identified in two other comoviruses. Therefore, SL1 
and SLC are likely essential comoviral RNA structures that play a conserved 
function in viral infection cycles.
