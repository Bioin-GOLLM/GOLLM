Latrophilins (LPHNs) are adhesion-like G-protein-coupled receptors implicated in 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Recently, LPHN3 was found to regulate 
excitatory synapse number through trans interactions with fibronectin 
leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3 (FLRT3). By isothermal titration 
calorimetry, we determined that only the olfactomedin (OLF) domain of LPHN3 is 
necessary for FLRT3 association. By multi-crystal native single-wavelength 
anomalous diffraction phasing, we determined the crystal structure of the OLF 
domain. This structure is a five-bladed β propeller with a Ca(2+) ion bound in 
the central pore, which is capped by a mobile loop that allows the ion to 
exchange with the solvent. The crystal structure of the OLF/FLRT3 complex shows 
that LPHN3-OLF in the closed state binds with high affinity to the concave face 
of FLRT3-LRR with a combination of hydrophobic and charged residues. Our study 
provides structural and functional insights into the molecular mechanism 
underlying the contribution of LPHN3/FLRT3 to the development of glutamatergic 
synapses.
