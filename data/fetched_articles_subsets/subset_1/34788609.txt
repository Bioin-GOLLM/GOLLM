Early steps of cancer initiation and metastasis, while critical for 
understanding disease mechanisms, are difficult to visualize and study. Here, we 
describe an approach to study the processes of initiation, progression, and 
metastasis of prostate cancer (PC) in a genetically engineered RapidCaP mouse 
model, which combines whole-organ imaging by serial two-photon tomography (STPT) 
and post hoc thick-section immunofluorescent (IF) analysis. STPT enables the 
detection of single tumor-initiating cells within the entire prostate, and 
consequent IF analysis reveals a transition from normal to transformed 
epithelial tissue and cell escape from the tumor focus. STPT imaging of the 
liver and brain reveal the distribution of multiple metastatic foci in the liver 
and an early-stage metastatic cell invasion in the brain. This imaging and data 
analysis pipeline can be readily applied to other mouse models of cancer, 
offering a highly versatile whole-organ platform to study in situ mechanisms of 
cancer initiation and progression.
