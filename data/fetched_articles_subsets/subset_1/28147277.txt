The Akt pathway is a central regulator that promotes cell survival in response 
to extracellular signals. Depletion of SIRT7, an NAD+-dependent deacetylase that 
is the least-studied sirtuin, is known to significantly increase Akt activity in 
mice through unknown mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that SIRT7 
depletion in breast cancer cells results in Akt hyper-phosphorylation and 
increases cell survival following genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, SIRT7 
specifically interacts with and deacetylates FKBP51 at residue lysines 28 and 
155 (K28 and K155), resulting in enhanced interactions among FKBP51, Akt, and 
PHLPP, as well as Akt dephosphorylation. Mutating both lysines to arginines 
abolishes the effect of SIRT7 on Akt activity through FKBP51 deacetylation. 
Finally, energy stress strengthens SIRT7-mediated effects on Akt 
dephosphorylation through FKBP51 and thus sensitizes cancer cells to cytotoxic 
agents. These results reveal a direct role of SIRT7 in Akt regulation and raise 
the possibility of using the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) as a 
chemo-sensitizing agent.
