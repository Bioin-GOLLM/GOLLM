IARS2, which encodes the mitochondrial form of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, has 
been found to play an important role in a range of diseases, including cancer. 
However, the relationship between IARS2 and melanoma is still unclear. To 
evaluate the role of IARS2 in melanoma, we constructed a stable A375 cell line 
with IARS2 knockdown via lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs. The 
expression of IARS2 was measured by real time-quantitative Polymerase Chain 
Reaction and western blot analysis. Cell counting, 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and colony 
formation assay were conducted to assess the effect of IARS2 on melanoma cell 
proliferation. Flow cytometry assay was used to determine cell apoptosis and 
cell cycle distribution in melanoma A375 cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry 
was employed to validate the expression of IARS2 protein in melanoma tissues. In 
this study it was found that IARS2 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines. 
Furthermore, IARS2 protein also exhibited elevated expression in the tumour 
tissues obtained from melanoma patients. After suppression of the mRNA 
expression of IARS2, the proliferation and colony formation ability of the A375 
cells were significantly inhibited, while the proportion of apoptotic A375 cells 
increased significantly, as indicated by an enhanced phosphatidylserine 
externalization and caspase 3/7 activity after IARS2 knockdown. Further 
investigations found that knockdown of IARS2 arrested cells in the G1 phase. The 
results suggested that IARS2 is critical for proliferation and apoptosis of 
melanoma cells.
