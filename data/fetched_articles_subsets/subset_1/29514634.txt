BACKGROUND: Because the cost of cereals is unstable and represents a large part 
of production charges for meat-type chicken, there is an urge to formulate 
alternative diets from more cost-effective feedstuff. We have recently shown 
that meat-type chicken source is prone to adapt to dietary starch substitution 
with fat and fiber. The aim of this study was to better understand the molecular 
mechanisms of this adaptation to changes in dietary energy sources through the 
fine characterization of transcriptomic changes occurring in three major 
metabolic tissues - liver, adipose tissue and muscle - as well as in circulating 
blood cells.
RESULTS: We revealed the fine-tuned regulation of many hepatic genes encoding 
key enzymes driving glycogenesis and de novo fatty acid synthesis pathways and 
of some genes participating in oxidation. Among the genes expressed upon 
consumption of a high-fat, high-fiber diet, we highlighted CPT1A, which encodes 
a key enzyme in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Conversely, the 
repression of lipogenic genes by the high-fat diet was clearly associated with 
the down-regulation of SREBF1 transcripts but was not associated with the 
transcript regulation of MLXIPL and NR1H3, which are both transcription factors. 
This result suggests a pivotal role for SREBF1 in lipogenesis regulation in 
response to a decrease in dietary starch and an increase in dietary PUFA. Other 
prospective regulators of de novo hepatic lipogenesis were suggested, such as 
PPARD, JUN, TADA2A and KAT2B, the last two genes belonging to the lysine acetyl 
transferase (KAT) complex family regulating histone and non-histone protein 
acetylation. Hepatic glycogenic genes were also down-regulated in chickens fed a 
high-fat, high-fiber diet compared to those in chickens fed a starch-based diet. 
No significant dietary-associated variations in gene expression profiles was 
observed in the other studied tissues, suggesting that the liver mainly 
contributed to the adaptation of birds to changes in energy source and nutrients 
in their diets, at least at the transcriptional level. Moreover, we showed that 
PUFA deposition observed in the different tissues may not rely on 
transcriptional changes.
CONCLUSION: We showed the major role of the liver, at the gene expression level, 
in the adaptive response of chicken to dietary starch substitution with fat and 
fiber.
