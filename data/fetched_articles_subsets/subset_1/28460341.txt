Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer) is an autosomal 
dominant disorder characterized by a significant risk of colorectal and 
endometrial cancers. A variety of other epithelial cancers may be associated 
with this syndrome. Brian tumors are infrequent, but have been reported in 
series. Here, we report a case of a 34-year-old Caucasian woman with WHO grade 
III choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC). Comprehensive genomic profiling of the 
patient's resected brain tumor revealed mutations in six genes: PTEN, VHL, MSH6, 
NOTCH1, RB1, and TP53. Family history is significant for endometrial cancer in 
her mother and sister as well as colon cancer in her maternal grandfather 
suggestive of Lynch syndrome. Site-specific mutational analysis showed the MSH6 
mutation (p.R482*) in peripheral lymphocytes. Subsequently we performed 
immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue which demonstrated widespread 
loss of MSH6 with intact MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome 
due to a mutation in MSH6 was therefore established. Our patient elected to have 
adjuvant radiation to the surgical bed only followed by prophylactic total 
abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and is doing very 
well. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of CPC in an adult patient 
with a germline MSH6 mutation. We believe our data have provided molecular 
evidence to suggest that CPC could potentially be part of the Lynch syndrome 
spectrum.
