Normal-weight obesity (NWO) is a phenotype characterized by excessive body fat 
(BF) despite normal body weight. We aimed to assess the association between NWO 
and the risk of sarcopenia. Two groups of patients with a normal body mass index 
[BMI (20-24.9 kg/m2)] were selected from a large cohort of participants. Body 
composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and 748 
participants were categorized as NWO or normal-weight without obesity (NWNO) and 
were classed according to whether or not they were at risk of sarcopenia. The 
"NWO group" included 374 participants (cases), compared to 374 participants 
(controls) in the "NWNO group", all of a similar BMI, age and gender. The 
participants in the "NWO group" displayed a higher prevalence of the risk of 
sarcopenia than the control group across both genders (0.6% vs. 14.1% in males; 
1.4% vs. 36.5% in females). Regression analysis showed that being in the NWO 
category increased the risk of sarcopenia 22-fold in males (RR = 22.27; 95%CI: 
3.35-147.98) and 25-fold in females (RR = 25.22; 95%CI: 8.12-78.36), compared to 
those in the NWNO category. In a "real-world" nutritional setting, the 
assessment of body composition to identify NWO syndrome is vital since it is 
also associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia.
