There is increasing evidence that common molecular pathways in neurons are 
closely linked with mitochondrial function and that mitochondrial dysfunction is 
connected to various forms of neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, 
mitochondria are involved in amyloid‐β (Aβ) deposition in Alzheimer's disease, 
although the exact molecular pathways remain largely unknown. Brunetti et al 
(2015) in this issue of EMBO Molecular Medicine provide a novel link between Aβ 
accumulation and mitochondria. A pathogenic mutation in a Norwegian family 
in the mitochondrial metallopeptidase PITRM1 is found to underlie a novel 
mitochondrial neurodegenerative phenotype associated with Aβ accumulation.
