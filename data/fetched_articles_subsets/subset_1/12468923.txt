Venous thrombosis of transverse and sigmoid sinuses was diagnosed in a 
3-year-old child who is a carrier of the G20210A prothrombin gene mutation. 
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment was started 9 days 
following the onset of neurologic signs. Nine days of rt-PA therapy completely 
dissolved the thrombus. This case provides further evidence that rt-PA is useful 
and safe in children with thrombosis.
