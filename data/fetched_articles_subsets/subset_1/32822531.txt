Inteins are selfish genetic elements residing in open reading frames that can 
splice post-translationally, resulting in the ligation of an uninterrupted, 
functional protein. Like other inteins, the DNA polymerase B (PolB) intein of 
the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii has an active homing endonuclease 
(HEN) domain, facilitating its horizontal transmission. Previous work has shown 
that the presence of the PolB intein exerts a significant fitness cost on the 
organism compared to an intein-free isogenic H. volcanii. Here, we show that 
mutation of a conserved residue in the HEN domain not only reduces intein homing 
but also slows growth. Surprisingly, although this mutation is far from the 
protein splicing active site, it also significantly reduces in vitro protein 
splicing. Moreover, two additional HEN domain mutations, which could not be 
introduced to H. volcanii, presumably due to lethality, also eliminate protein 
splicing activity in vitro. These results suggest an interplay between HEN 
residues and the protein splicing domain, despite an over 35 Ã… separation in a 
PolB intein homology model. The combination of in vivo and in vitro evidence 
strongly supports a model of codependence between the self-splicing domain and 
the HEN domain that has been alluded to by previous in vitro studies of protein 
splicing with HEN domain-containing inteins.
