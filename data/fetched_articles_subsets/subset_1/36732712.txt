BACKGROUND: The recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1) protein is essential for 
the V (variable)-D (diversity)-J (joining) recombination process. Mutations in 
RAG1 have been reported to be associated with several types of immune disorders. 
Typical clinical features driven by RAG1 variants include persistent infections, 
severe lymphopenia, and decreased immunoglobulin levels .
CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, a 2-month-24-days-old infant with recurrent 
fever was admitted to our hospital with multiple infections and absence of T and 
B lymphocytes. The infant was diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID). A homozygous variation c.2147G>A (NM_000448.2: exonme2: c.2147G>A 
(p.Arg716Gln)) was identified in the RAG1 gene using whole-exome sequencing and 
Sanger sequencing. The predicted 3D structure of variant RAG1 indicated altered 
protein stability. Additionally, decreased expression of variant RAG1 gene was 
detected at both the mRNA and protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a novel homozygous variant in RAG1 gene that 
causes SCID. This finding expands the variant spectrum of RAG1 in SCID and 
provides further evidence for the clinical diagnosis of SCID.
