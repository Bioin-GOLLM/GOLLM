Escherichia coli thioredoxin has been previously exploited as a scaffold for the 
presentation/stabilization of peptide aptamers as well as to confer 
immunogenicity to peptide epitopes. Here we focused on other key features of 
thioredoxin that are of general interest for the production of safer and more 
effective peptide immunogens, such as a high thermal stability, lack of 
cross-reactivity and a low-cost of production. We identified thioredoxin from 
the archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrx) as a novel scaffold meeting all 
the above criteria. PfTrx is a highly thermostable and protease-resistant 
scaffold with a strong (poly)peptide solubilisation capacity. Anti-PfTrx 
antibodies did not cross-react with mouse, nor human thioredoxin. Untagged PfTrx 
bearing a previously identified HPV16-L2 peptide epitope was obtained in a >90% 
pure form with a one-step thermal purification procedure and effectively 
elicited the production of neutralizing anti-HPV antibodies. We thus propose 
PfTrx as a superior, general-purpose scaffold for the construction of safe, 
stable, and low-cost peptide immunogens.
