BACKGROUND: Three siblings with goitre and latent to mild hypothyroidism were 
suspected of having thyroid peroxidase (TPO) abnormality. Direct sequencing of 
their genomic DNAs showed two novel mutations of the TPO gene, one of which was 
G1687T (Gly533Cys; exon 9) and the other 1808-13del (Asp574/Leu575del; exon 10). 
The two mutations were compound heterozygous, as the former was found in their 
father's DNA as heterozygous, and the latter was found in DNA from their mother, 
also as heterozygous. As Gly533 and Asp574/Leu575 were well-conserved amino 
acids in the peroxidase superfamily, Gly533Cys- and Asp574/Leu575del-TPOs were 
thought to be affected structurally or functionally. In expression studies using 
CHO-Kl cells and mRNAs introduced with individual mutations, both mutated TPO 
proteins were expressed at the same molecular size as wild-type TPO and had 
enzyme activity, although Gly533Cys-TPO was slightly lower in efficiency of 
expression and more degenerative than wild-type TPO.
METHODS: We examined the localization of both mutated TPOs. Gly533Cys-TPO was 
located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope but not on the 
plasma membrane, whereas Asp574/Leu575del-TPO was located not only on the ER and 
nuclear envelope but also on the plasma membrane, as wild-type TPO. 
Nevertheless, only one point differed between Asp574/Leu575del- and wild-type 
TPOs: the mutated TPO was expressed on the plasma membrane surface at less than 
half the rate of wild-type TPO.
RESULTS: Gly533Cys-TPO synthesized almost no thyroid hormone because of its 
defective localization on the apical membrane surface of thyrocytes, whereas 
Asp574/Leu575del-TPO performed thyroid hormone synthesis at a rate of less half 
that of wild-type TPO. In cotransfection experiments using three combinations of 
wild-type and G1687T-mRNAs, wild-type and 1808-13del-mRNAs, and G1687T-, 
1808-13del-mRNAs, the three kinds of mRNAs were considered to have no influence 
on cell surface TPO expression of another mRNA when a 50%-maximal amount of each 
mRNA was transfected. When a larger amount of each mRNA was transfected, the 
former two combinations showed the level of cell surface TPO expression obtained 
from the saturating amount of wild-type mRNA, whereas the last combination of 
mutated mRNAs covered only about half of the expression level.
CONCLUSION: Defective thyroid hormone production resulting from the abnormal 
TPOs was at a level that caused latent hypothyroidism when the patients were 
born. With their growth, thyroid hormone volume gradually became inadequate and 
their thyroid gland enlarged compensatorily.
