A novel glucose transporter, the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), has 
been demonstrated to contribute to the demand for glucose by pancreatic and 
prostate tumors, and its functional activity has been imaged using a SGLT 
specific PET imaging probe, Î±-methyl-4-[F-18]fluoro-4-deoxy-D-glucopyaranoside 
(Me-4FDG). In this study, Me-4FDG PET was extended to evaluate patients with 
high-grade astrocytic tumors. Me-4FDG PET scans were performed in four patients 
diagnosed with WHO Grade III or IV astrocytomas and control subjects, and 
compared with 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (2-FDG) PET and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the same subjects. Immunocytochemistry was carried 
out on Grade IV astrocytomas to determine the cellular location of SGLT proteins 
within the tumors. Me-4FDG retention was pronounced in astrocytomas in dramatic 
contrast to the lack of uptake into the normal brain, resulting in a high 
signal-to-noise ratio. Macroscopically, the distribution of Me-4FDG within the 
tumors overlapped with that of 2-FDG uptake and tumor definition using 
contrast-enhanced MRI images. Microscopically, the SGLT2 protein was found to be 
expressed in neoplastic glioblastoma cells and endothelial cells of the 
proliferating microvasculature. This preliminary study shows that Me-4FDG is a 
highly sensitive probe for visualization of high-grade astrocytomas by PET. The 
distribution of Me-4FDG within tumors overlapped that for 2-FDG, but the absence 
of background brain Me-4FDG resulted in superior imaging sensitivity. 
Furthermore, the presence of SGLT2 protein in astrocytoma cells and the 
proliferating microvasculature may offer a novel therapy using the SGLT2 
inhibitors already approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.
