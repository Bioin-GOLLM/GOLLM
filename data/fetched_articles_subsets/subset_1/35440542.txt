Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common and aggressive subtype of 
renal cancer. Here we conduct a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of 232 
tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue pairs from Chinese ccRCC patients. By 
comparing with tumor adjacent tissues, we find that ccRCC shows extensive 
metabolic dysregulation and an enhanced immune response. Molecular subtyping 
classifies ccRCC tumors into three subtypes (GP1-3), among which the most 
aggressive GP1 exhibits the strongest immune phenotype, increased metastasis, 
and metabolic imbalance, linking the multi-omics-derived phenotypes to clinical 
outcomes of ccRCC. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), a one-carbon 
metabolic enzyme, is identified as a potential marker of ccRCC and a drug target 
for GP1. We demonstrate that NNMT induces DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic 
subunit (DNA-PKcs) homocysteinylation, increases DNA repair, and promotes ccRCC 
tumor growth. This study provides insights into the biological underpinnings and 
prognosis assessment of ccRCC, revealing targetable metabolic vulnerabilities.
