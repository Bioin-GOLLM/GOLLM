Graves' disease is a most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune 
disease, and autoimmune process induces an inflammatory reaction, and reactive 
oxygen species (ROSs) are among its products. When balance between oxidants and 
antioxidants is disturbed, in favour of the oxidants it is termed "oxidative 
stress" (OS). Increased OS characterizes Graves' disease. It seems that the 
level of OS is increased in subjects with Graves' ophthalmopathy compared to the 
other subjects with Graves' disease. Among the other factors, OS is involved in 
proliferation of orbital fibroblasts. Polymorphism of the 8-oxoG DNA 
N-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) involved in repair of the oxidative damaged DNA 
increases in the risk for developing Grave's disease. Treatment with 
glucocorticoids reduces levels of OS markers. A recent large clinical trial 
evaluated effect of selenium on mild Graves' ophthalmopathy. Selenium treatment 
was associated with an improved quality of life and less eye involvement and 
slowed the progression of Graves' orbitopathy, compared to placebo.
