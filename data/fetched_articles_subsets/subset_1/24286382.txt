BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies have shown 
associations between variants at five loci (TNS1, GSTCD, HTR4, AGER and THSD4) 
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung function. However, 
their association with COPD has not been proven in Chinese Han population, nor 
have COPD-related phenotypes been studied. The objective of this study was to 
look for associations between five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 
these novel candidate genes and COPD susceptibility or lung function in a 
Chinese Han population.
METHODS: Allele and genotype data on 680 COPD patients and 687 healthy controls 
for sentinel SNP in these five loci were investigated. Allele frequencies and 
genotype distributions were compared between cases and controls, and odds ratios 
were calculated. Potential relationships between these SNP and COPD-related lung 
function were assessed.
RESULTS: No significant associations were found between any of the SNP and COPD 
in cases and controls. The SNP (rs3995090) in HTR4 was associated with COPD 
(adjusted P = 0.022) in never-smokers, and the SNP (rs2070600) in AGER was 
associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 %) predicted (β = -0.066, 
adjusted P = 0.016) and FEV1 /forced vital capacity (β = -0.071, adjusted 
P = 0.009) in all subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The variant at HTR4 was associated with COPD in never-smokers, and 
the SNP in AGER was associated with pulmonary function in a Chinese Han 
population.
