Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of molecular screening of 
tumour samples for matching patients with cancer to targeted therapies. However, 
most of them have been carried out at institutional or national level. Herein, 
we report on the pilot phase of AURORA (NCT02102165), a European multinational 
collaborative molecular screening initiative for advanced breast cancer 
patients. Forty-one patients were prospectively enroled at four participating 
centres across Europe. Metastatic tumours were biopsied and profiled using an 
Ion Torrent sequencing platform at a central facility. Sequencing results were 
obtained for 63% of the patients in real-time with variable turnaround time 
stemming from delays between patient consent and biopsy. At least one clinically 
actionable mutation was identified in 73% of patients. We used the Illumina 
sequencing technology for orthogonal validation and achieved an average of 66% 
concordance of substitution calls per patient. Additionally, copy number 
aberrations inferred from the Ion Torrent sequencing were compared to single 
nucleotide polymorphism arrays and found to be 59% concordant on average. 
Although this study demonstrates that powerful next generation genomic 
techniques are logistically ready for international molecular screening programs 
in routine clinical settings, technical challenges remain to be addressed in 
order to ensure the accuracy and clinical utility of the genomic data.
