Generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell line (SHCDNRi001-A) from a 
patient with X-linked Alport syndrome carrying a heterozygous p.G409S (c. 1225 
G > A) mutation in the COL4A5 gene.

X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is a rare form of hereditary nephritis caused by 
mutations in the COL4A5 gene encoding the type IV collagen α5 chain. A skin 
biopsy was performed on one female patient with XLAS who carried a heterozygous 
p.G409S (c. 1225 G > A) mutation in the COL4A5 gene. A human-induced pluripotent 
stem cell (iPSC) line was generated from dermal fibroblasts using the 
integrating free Sendai virus technique. The generated iPSC line SHCDNRi001-A 
offers an efficient resource to research pathogenic mechanisms in XLAS, as well 
as a cell-based disease model for drug testing or other treatments.
