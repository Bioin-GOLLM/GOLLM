In the unprecedented single-cell sequencing and spatial multiomics era of 
biology, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technologies with higher 
sensitivity and robustness, especially for detecting short RNAs and other 
biomolecules, are greatly desired. Here, we develop the robust multiplex π-FISH 
rainbow method to detect diverse biomolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins, and 
neurotransmitters) individually or simultaneously with high efficiency. This 
versatile method is successfully applied to detect gene expression in different 
species, from microorganisms to plants and animals. Furthermore, we delineate 
the landscape of diverse neuron subclusters by decoding the spatial distribution 
of 21 marker genes via only two rounds of hybridization. Significantly, we 
combine π-FISH rainbow with hybridization chain reaction to develop π-FISH+ 
technology for short nucleic acid fragments, such as microRNA and prostate 
cancer anti-androgen therapy-resistant marker ARV7 splicing variant in 
circulating tumour cells from patients. Our study provides a robust biomolecule 
in situ detection technology for spatial multiomics investigation and clinical 
diagnosis.
