Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) were originally identified as the active 
components in bone extracts that can induce ectopic bone formation. In recent 
decades, their key role has broadly expanded beyond bone physiology and 
pathology. Nowadays, the BMP pathway is considered an important player in 
vascular signaling. Indeed, mutations in genes encoding different components of 
the BMP pathway cause various severe vascular diseases. Their signaling 
contributes to the morphological, functional and molecular heterogeneity among 
endothelial cells in different vessel types such as arteries, veins, lymphatic 
vessels and capillaries within different organs. The BMP pathway is a remarkably 
fine-tuned pathway. As a result, its signaling output in the vessel wall 
critically depends on the cellular context, which includes flow hemodynamics, 
interplay with other vascular signaling cascades and the interaction of 
endothelial cells with peri-endothelial cells and the surrounding matrix. In 
this review, the emerging role of BMP signaling in lymphatic vessel biology will 
be highlighted within the framework of BMP signaling in the circulatory 
vasculature.
