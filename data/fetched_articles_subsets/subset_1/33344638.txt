Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2) is a bidirectional transporter 
embedded in the biological membrane and is ubiquitously found in most tissue and 
cell types. ENT2 mediates the uptake of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and 
nucleobase besides transporting a variety of nucleoside-derived drugs, mostly in 
anticancer therapy. Since high expression of ENT2 has been correlated with 
advanced stages of different types of cancers, consequently, this has gained 
significant interest in the role of ENT2 as a potential therapeutic target. 
Furthermore, ENT2 plays critical roles in signaling pathway and cell cycle 
progression. Therefore, elucidating the physiological roles of ENT2 and its 
properties may contribute to a better understanding of ENT2 roles beyond their 
transportation mechanism. This review is aimed at highlighting the main roles of 
ENT2 and at providing a brief update on the recent research.
