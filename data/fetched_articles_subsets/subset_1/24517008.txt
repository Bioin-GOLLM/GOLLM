Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) has an inhibitory function 
on T cells and is critical for the induction of peripheral tolerance. CTLA-4 +49 
G allele affects the CTLA-4 function and has been reported to be correlated with 
a higher risk of various autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). 
The present study was conducted to investigate the association between the 
polymorphism of the CTLA-4 exon 1+49 A/G and susceptibility to TID and type 2 
diabetes (T2D) in Kurds living in Iranian Kurdistan. The+49 A/G polymorphism was 
analyzed in 60 patients with T1D, 56 patients with T2D and 107 control subjects 
using PCR Single-strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) and restriction 
fragment length polymorphism methods. All studied populations (T1D, T2D and 
Controls) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p, 0.39, 0.94 and 0.89, 
respectively). Both+49 G allele (p = 0. 015, OR = 1.86) and +49 A/G genotype 
frequencies (p = 0. 012, OR = 2.31) were significantly higher in T1D patients 
than control. There was significant over-representation of the G allele in 
female T1D patients. No significant differences in +49 G allele and +49 A/G 
genotype frequencies were found between T2D and control subjects. SSCP analysis 
did not show new mutation in the amplified segment. The results of this study 
indicate that CTLA-4+49 A/G gene polymorphism confers genetic susceptibility to 
T1D but not T2D in the Kurdish population living in Iranian Kurdistan and women 
carrying the +49 G allele are at greater risk of getting T1D than men having the 
G allele.
