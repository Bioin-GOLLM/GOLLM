Human p53R2 (hp53R2) is a 351-residue p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase 
(RNR) small subunit. It shares >80% sequence identity with hRRM2, the small RNR 
subunit responsible for normal maintenance of the deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) 
pool used for DNA replication, which is active during the S phase in a cell 
cycle-dependent fashion. But rather than cyclic dNTP synthesis, hp53R2 has been 
shown to supply dNTPs for DNA repair to cells in G0-G1 in a p53-dependent 
fashion. The first X-ray crystal structure of hp53R2 is determined to 2.6 A, in 
which monomers A and B exhibit mono- and binuclear iron occupancy, respectively. 
The pronounced structural differences at three regions between hp53R2 and hRRM2 
highlight the possible regulatory role in iron assimilation and help explain 
previously observed physical and biochemical differences in the mobility and 
accessibility of the radical iron center, as well as radical transfer pathways 
between the two enzymes. The sequence-structure-function correlations that 
differentiate hp53R2 and hRRM2 are revealed for the first time. Insight gained 
from this structural work will be used in the identification of biological 
function, regulation mechanism, and inhibitor selection in RNR small subunits.
