BACKGROUND: Treatment of metastatic brain tumors often involves radiotherapy 
with or without surgical resection as the first step. However, the indications 
for when to use surgery are not clearly defined for certain tumor sizes and 
multiplicity. This study seeks to determine whether resection of brain 
metastases versus exclusive radiotherapy provided improved survival and local 
control in cases where metastases are limited in number and diameter.
METHODS: According to PRISMA guidelines, this meta-analysis compares outcomes 
from treatment of a median number of brain metastases ≤ 4 with a median diameter 
≤ 4 cm with exclusive radiotherapy versus surgery followed by radiotherapy. Four 
randomized control trials and 11 observational studies (1693 patients) met 
inclusion criteria. For analysis, studies were grouped based on whether 
radiation involved stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiotherapy 
(WBRT).
RESULTS: In both analyses, there was no difference in survival between surgery ± 
SRS versus SRS alone two years after treatment (OR 1.89 (95% CI: 0.47-7.55, P = 
.23) or surgery + WBRT versus radiotherapy alone (either WBRT and/or SRS) (OR 
1.18 (95% CI: 0.76-1.84, P = .46). However, surgical patients demonstrated 
greater risk for local tumor recurrence compared to SRS alone (OR 2.20 (95% CI: 
1.49-3.25, P < .0001)) and compared to WBRT/SRS (OR 2.93; 95% CI: 1.68-5.13, P = 
.0002).
CONCLUSION: The higher incidence of local tumor recurrence for surgical patients 
suggests that more prospective studies are needed to clarify outcomes for 
treatment of 1-4 metastasis less than 4 cm diameter.
