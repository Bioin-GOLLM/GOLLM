Recent studies have identified genes and core pathways that are altered in human 
glioblastoma. However, the mechanisms by which alterations of these glioblastoma 
genes singly and cooperatively transform brain cells remain poorly understood. 
Further, the cell of origin of glioblastoma is largely elusive. By targeting a 
p53 in-frame deletion mutation to the brain, we show that p53 deficiency 
provides no significant growth advantage to adult brain cells, but appears to 
induce pleiotropic accumulation of cooperative oncogenic alterations driving 
gliomagenesis. Our data show that accumulation of a detectable level of mutant 
p53 proteins occurs first in neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) 
and that subsequent expansion of mutant p53-expressing Olig2(+) 
transit-amplifying progenitor-like cells in the SVZ-associated areas initiates 
glioma formation.
