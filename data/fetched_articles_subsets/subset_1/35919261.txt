CONTEXT: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are known to be rare. 
However, there is scant literature reporting their epidemiology, particularly 
whether the diagnosis of PPGL has increased with advances in medical imaging and 
biochemical and genetic testing.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine the 
annual incidence of PPGLs and change over time.
DESIGN: A systematic review was performed. Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Web of 
Science Core Collection databases were searched to identify studies reporting 
PPGL incidence. Studies were eligible for inclusion from the database's 
inception until August 30, 2021.
RESULTS: A total of 6109 manuscripts were identified; 2282 duplicates were 
excluded, and a further 3815 papers were excluded after abstract and/or full 
text review. Twelve studies were included in the final review. The incidence of 
PPGL ranged from 0.04 to 0.95 cases per 100 000 per year. Incidence increased 
over time, from approximately 0.2/100,000 individuals in studies performed 
before 2000, to approximately 0.6/100,000 in studies undertaken after 2010. The 
mode of diagnosis changed over the same time period, with more patients 
diagnosed from incidental imaging findings, and fewer at autopsy or from 
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The annual incidence of PPGL has increased over time. Much of this 
increase is likely from incidental identification of tumors on imaging. However, 
the epidemiology of PPGL remains understudied, in particular, in associations 
with altitude, ethnicity, and genetics. To improve early detection and 
management guidelines, these gaps should be addressed.
