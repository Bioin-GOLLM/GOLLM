Biophysical/biochemical cues from the environment contribute to regulation of 
the regenerative capacity of resident skeletal muscle stem cells called 
satellites cells. This can be observed in vitro, where muscle cell behaviour is 
influenced by the particular culture substrates and whether culture is performed 
in a 2D or 3D environment, with changes including morphology, nuclear shape and 
cytoskeletal organization. To create a 3D skeletal muscle model we compared 
collagen I, Fibrin or PEG-Fibrinogen with different sources of murine and human 
myogenic cells. To generate tension in the 3D scaffold, biomaterials were 
polymerised between two flexible silicone posts to mimic tendons. This 3D 
culture system has multiple advantages including being simple, fast to set up 
and inexpensive, so providing an accessible tool to investigate myogenesis in a 
3D environment. Immortalised human and murine myoblast lines, and primary murine 
satellite cells showed varying degrees of myogenic differentiation when cultured 
in these biomaterials, with C2 myoblasts in particular forming large 
multinucleated myotubes in collagen I or Fibrin. However, murine satellite cells 
retained in their niche on a muscle fibre and embedded in 3D collagen I or 
Fibrin gels generated aligned, multinucleated and contractile myotubes.
