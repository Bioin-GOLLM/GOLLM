OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare the fracture resistance of 
ceramic veneers and composite resin veneers with and without dental preparation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty freshly extracted mandibular premolars were 
selected and randomly assigned into four groups (n = 10): Group NPR = no dental 
preparation and direct veneer with 0.2 mm thick composite resin (Amelogen Plus, 
Ultradent); Group NPC = no dental preparation and 0.2 mm thick lithium 
disilicate ceramic veneer (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent); Group P2C = Tooth 
preparation of 0.2 mm and 0.2 mm thick ceramic veneer (IPS e.max Press); and 
Group P5C = Tooth preparation of 0.5 mm and 0.5 mm-thick ceramic veneer (IPS 
e.max Press). In all groups, the restorations covered 1 mm of the occlusal 
surface of the buccal cusp, and the thickness of this area was the same of the 
buccal area (0.2 mm or 0.5 mm). After the luting procedure, all groups were 
thermocycled (10,000 cycles, 5°C-55°C) and subjected to fracture resistance test 
under compression (Instron 4444 with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min). The mode 
of failure analysis was performed under a ×10 magnification. Data were subjected 
to one-way ANOVA and Duncan's post hoc test (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: The mean fracture resistance (men ± standard deviation) was NPR = 
690.33 ± 233, NPC = 790.52 ± 408, P2C = 1131.34 ± 341, and P5C = 983.56 ± 202. 
There were significant differences of the fracture resistance values between all 
groups (P = 0.013). NPR and NPC groups showed mean values of fracture resistance 
significantly lower than P2C. However, P5C presented intermediate values without 
a significant difference from the other groups. The mode of failure for all 
groups was mixed (60%), cohesive failures (20%), root failures (15%), and 
adhesive failures (5%).
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive tooth preparation (0.2-mm) allowed to achieve 
higher fracture resistance in premolars restored with lithium disilicate ceramic 
veneers. Attention should be given to the 0.5 mm preparation since catastrophic 
fractures only happened when this preparation depth was performed.
