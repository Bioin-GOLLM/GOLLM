BACKGROUND: Males have excess advanced liver disease and cirrhosis risk 
including from chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection though the reasons are 
unclear.
GOAL: To examine the role variants in genes involved in androgen and estrogen 
biosynthesis and metabolism play in HCV-related liver disease risk in males.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study evaluating single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 16 candidate genes involved in androgen and estrogen 
ligand and receptor synthesis and risk of advanced hepatic fibrosis (F3/F4-F4) 
and inflammation (A2/A3-A3). We calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) using 
logistic regression and used multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis 
to assess for gene-environment interaction.
RESULTS: Among 466 chronically HCV-infected males, 59% (n = 274) had advanced 
fibrosis and 54% (n = 252) had advanced inflammation. Nine of 472 SNPs were 
significantly associated with fibrosis risk; 4 in AKR1C3 (e.g., AKR1C3 
rs2186174: ORadj = 2.04, 95% CI 1.38-3.02), 1 each in AKR1C2 and ESR1, and 1 in 
HSD17B6. Four SNPs were associated with inflammation risk, 2 in SRD5A1 (e.g., 
SRD5A1 rs248800: ORadj = 1.86, 95% CI 1.20-2.88) and 1 each in AKR1C2 and 
AKR1C3. MDR analysis identified a single AKR1C3 locus (rs2186174) as the best 
model for advanced fibrosis; while a 4-locus model with diabetes, AKR1C2 
rs12414884, SRD5A1 rs6555406, and SRD5A1 rs248800 was best for inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: The consistency of our findings suggests AKR1C isoenzymes 2 and 3, 
and potentially SRD5A1, may play a role in progression of HCV-related liver 
disease in males. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and to 
assess if similar associations exist in females.
