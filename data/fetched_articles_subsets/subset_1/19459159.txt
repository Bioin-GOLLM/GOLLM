The elevated expression of P504S gene and its product alpha-methylacyl-CoA 
racemase (AMACR) can serve as a molecular marker for prostate cancer. The goal 
of this study is to investigate P504S/AMACR expression in fine-needle aspiration 
smears and correlate it with cytological diagnosis. Immunocytochemistry was 
performed in 35 patients with morphological diagnosis of prostate carcinoma (n = 
16), atypia (n = 15), and benign hyperplasia (n = 4). Among 16 malignant cases 
there were two low-grade, eight intermediate, and six high-grade prostate 
carcinomas. Cytoplasmic positivity is analyzed qualitatively as predominantly 
diffuse or focal and quantitatively as <5%, 5-50%, and >50% of cells. Benign 
cases showed no P504S/AMACR expression. Positive staining was recorded in 75% of 
malignant cases, but in the majority of them it was weak and focal or diffuse 
and in a small amount of cells. The most intensive staining was seen in 
low-grade carcinomas and some atypical cases. This observation indicates a 
correlation between P504S/AMACR expression and differentiation of cells. 
P504S/AMACR staining might be of great value in cytodiagnosis of prostate 
lesions as well as an example of the characterization of cells at the molecular 
level using fresh tissue obtained by fine-needle aspiration.
