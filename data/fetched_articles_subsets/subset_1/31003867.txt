Double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate the homologous recombination that is 
crucial for meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation. Here, we unveil mouse 
ANKRD31 as a lynchpin governing multiple aspects of DSB formation. Spermatocytes 
lacking ANKRD31 have altered DSB locations and fail to target DSBs to the 
pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of sex chromosomes. They also have delayed and/or 
fewer recombination sites but, paradoxically, more DSBs, suggesting DSB 
dysregulation. Unrepaired DSBs and pairing failures-stochastic on autosomes, 
nearly absolute on X and Y-cause meiotic arrest and sterility in males. 
Ankrd31-deficient females have reduced oocyte reserves. A crystal structure 
defines a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in REC114 and its direct 
intermolecular contacts with ANKRD31. In vivo, ANKRD31 stabilizes REC114 
association with the PAR and elsewhere. Our findings inform a model in which 
ANKRD31 is a scaffold anchoring REC114 and other factors to specific genomic 
locations, thereby regulating DSB formation.
