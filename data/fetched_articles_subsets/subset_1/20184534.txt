BACKGROUND: Circulating concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are 
associated with cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with coronary 
artery disease. We investigated the determinants of MMP-9 concentrations by 
analyzing MMP-9 genotypes and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: A total of 596 individuals were recruited for this study. Six single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with coverage of the MMP-9 gene region were 
analyzed; and two genotypes, rs3918242-TT and rs2274756-AA, which were in nearly 
complete linkage disequilibrium, were associated with higher MMP-9 values 
(p=0.007 and p=0.008, respectively). In age- and gender-adjusted regression 
models, MMP-9 concentrations were positively associated with the homeostasis 
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and triglyceride 
concentrations, fasting serum insulin, fasting plasma glucose, C-reactive 
protein, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A. By multivariate analysis, rs2274756 
genotypes, age, smoking status, fibrinogen and fasting plasma glucose 
concentrations were all independently associated with MMP-9 (p=0.007, p=0.033, 
p=0.003, p=0.013, and p=0.012, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The rs2274756-AA and rs3918242-TT genotypes, younger age, current 
smoking status and increased fasting plasma glucose, and fibrinogen 
concentrations were independently associated with high serum MMP-9 
concentrations in Taiwanese individuals.
