A clinically-relevant, drug-resistant mutant of HIV-1 protease (PR), termed 
Flap+(I54V) and containing L10I, G48V, I54V and V82A mutations, is known to 
produce significant changes in the entropy and enthalpy balance of drug-PR 
interactions, compared to wild-type PR. A similar mutant, Flap+(I54A) , which 
evolves from Flap+(I54V) and contains the single change at residue 54 relative 
to Flap+(I54V) , does not. Yet, how Flap+(I54A) behaves in solution is not 
known. To understand the molecular basis of V54A evolution, we compared nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal 
titration calorimetry, and enzymatic assay data from four PR proteins: PR (pWT), 
Flap+(I54V) , Flap+(I54A) , and Flap+(I54) , a control mutant that contains only 
L10I, G48V and V82A mutations. Our data consistently show that selection to the 
smaller side chain at residue 54, not only decreases inhibitor affinity, but 
also restores the catalytic activity.
