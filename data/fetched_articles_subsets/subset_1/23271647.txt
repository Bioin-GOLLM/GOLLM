The conserved kinases PAR-1/MARK are critically involved in processes such as 
asymmetric cell division, cell polarity and neuronal differentiation. Their 
deregulation has been implicated in diseases including Alzheimer's disease and 
cancer. Given the importance of PAR-1/MARK in health and disease, their 
activities need to be tightly controlled. However, little is known about the 
molecular mechanisms underlying their regulation in vivo. Here we show that in 
Drosophila, a phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination mechanism restrains PAR-1 
activation. Active PAR-1 generated by LKB1-controlled phosphorylation is 
targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box 
containing complex) (Slimb), whose action is antagonized by the deubiquitinating 
enzyme fat facets. This newly identified PAR-1-modifying module critically 
regulates synaptic morphology and tau-mediated postsynaptic toxicity of amyloid 
precursor protein (APP)/Aβ-42, the causative agents of Alzheimer's disease, at 
the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Our results provide new insights into the 
regulation of PAR-1 in various physiological processes and offer new therapeutic 
strategies for diseases involving PAR-1/MARK deregulation.
