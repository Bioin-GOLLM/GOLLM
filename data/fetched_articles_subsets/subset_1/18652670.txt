Recent evidence supports a neuroprotective role for Wnt signaling in 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In fact, a 
relationship between amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity and a 
decrease in the cytoplasmic levels of beta-catenin has been observed. Apparently 
Abeta binds to the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of the Frizzled receptor 
(Fz) inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Cross-talk with other signaling 
cascades that regulate Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, including the activation of 
M1 muscarinic receptor and PKC, the use of Ibuprofen-ChE bi-functional 
compounds, PPAR alpha, gamma agonists, nicotine and some antioxidants, results 
in neuroprotection against Abeta. These studies indicate that a sustained loss 
of Wnt signaling function may be involved in the Abeta-dependent 
neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's brain. In conclusion the activation of 
the Wnt signaling pathway could be proposed as a therapeutic target for the 
treatment of AD.
