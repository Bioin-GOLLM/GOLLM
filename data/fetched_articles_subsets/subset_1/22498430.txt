Integration of the viral genome into host cell chromatin is a pivotal and unique 
step in the replication cycle of retroviruses, including HIV. Inhibiting HIV 
replication by specifically blocking the viral integrase enzyme that mediates 
this step is an obvious and attractive therapeutic strategy. After concerted 
efforts, the first viable integrase inhibitors were developed in the early 
2000s, ultimately leading to the clinical licensure of the first integrase 
strand transfer inhibitor, raltegravir. Similarly structured compounds and 
derivative second generation integrase strand transfer inhibitors, such as 
elvitegravir and dolutegravir, are now in various stages of clinical 
development. Furthermore, other mechanisms aimed at the inhibition of viral 
integration are being explored in numerous preclinical studies, which include 
inhibition of 3' processing and chromatin targeting. The development of new 
clinically useful compounds will be aided by the characterization of the 
retroviral intasome crystal structure. This review considers the history of the 
clinical development of HIV integrase inhibitors, the development of antiviral 
drug resistance and the need for new antiviral compounds.
