Early life stress (ELS) has been associated with an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease. We examined whether ELS was associated with autonomic 
function and stress reactivity among individuals with coronary heart disease 
(CHD). We included patients with stable CHD from two parallel studies, the 
Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and 
Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2), and assessed ELS using the Early Trauma 
Inventory-Self-Report-Short Form. Participants underwent a laboratory-based 
mental stress task while undergoing ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. 
We used multivariate linear regression models to estimate the associations 
between ELS and heart rate variability (HRV; low frequency [LF], high frequency 
[HF], and LF and HF [LH] ratio). The analytic sample included 405 MIPS and 284 
MIMS2 participants. Most participants endorsed at least one experience of ELS 
(92.2%). Although we did not observe associations between ELS and HRV outcomes 
in the overall sample, ELS was associated with lower LH ratio HRV during 
recovery in the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subgroup, ELS x PTSD 
interaction, p = .041. In the MIMS2 subgroup, ELS was associated with lower 
resting period LF HRV, B̂  = -0.16 ln ms2 ; 95% CI [-0.31, -0.02]. Exposure to 
physical trauma was associated with decreased HF HRV overall reactivity only 
among participants with high to moderate depressive symptoms, B̂  = -0.52 ln ms2 
vs. B̂  = 0.01 ln ms2 , p = .013. Overall, heterogeneous associations between 
ELS and HRV emerged, suggesting the need for additional research regarding 
longer-term ambulatory HRV.
