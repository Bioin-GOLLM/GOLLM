Stem cells balance cellular fates through asymmetric and symmetric divisions in 
order to self-renew or to generate downstream progenitors. Symmetric commitment 
divisions in stem cells are required for rapid regeneration during tissue damage 
and stress. The control of symmetric commitment remains poorly defined. Using 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in combination with transcriptomic 
profiling of HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells) from control and 
m6A methyltransferase Mettl3 conditional knockout mice, we found that 
m6A-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) fail to symmetrically 
differentiate. Dividing HSCs are expanded and are blocked in an intermediate 
state that molecularly and functionally resembles multipotent progenitors. 
Mechanistically, RNA methylation controls Myc mRNA abundance in differentiating 
HSCs. We identified MYC as a marker for HSC asymmetric and symmetric commitment. 
Overall, our results indicate that RNA methylation controls symmetric commitment 
and cell identity of HSCs and may provide a general mechanism for how stem cells 
regulate differentiation fate choice.
