OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical manifestations of adult-onset Alexander 
disease (AOAD) in Japanese patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
gene mutations.
METHODS AND MATERIALS:   Twelve patients of AOAD with GFAP mutations detected in 
our centre were examined for neurological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
findings.
RESULTS:   Major symptoms were pyramidal and bulbar signs. In addition, three 
patients presented abnormal behaviour and/or memory disturbance. Two of the 
three patients also had Parkinsonism and had been diagnosed with fronto-temporal 
dementia or progressive supranuclear palsy until GFAP mutations were detected. 
Abnormalities of the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord were observed on 
MRI in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS:   Patients presenting with pyramidal and/or bulbar signs with 
abnormalities of the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord on MRI should be 
considered for GFAP analysis as this is the typical presentation of AOAD. 
Abnormal behaviour and cognitive disorders including deterioration of memory 
were rare symptoms but could be an obstacle to diagnosing Alexander disease.
