BACKGROUND: The calcium sensing receptor (CASR) is a G protein-coupled receptor 
that is responsible for assessing extracellular Ca2+ levels and thus plays a 
crucial role in calcium homeostasis. Hypercalcemia is a metabolic risk factor 
for pancreatitis and rare CASR variants have been described in patients with 
chronic pancreatitis. At the carboxy-terminal tail of CASR, there is a cluster 
of three common polymorphisms, p.A986S (rs1801725), p.R990G (rs1042636) and 
p.Q1011E (rs1801726), which have been associated with chronic pancreatitis in 
various studies, but with conflicting results.
METHODS: We examined 542 German and 339 French patients with chronic 
pancreatitis as well as 1025 German controls for the 3 common CASR polymorphism 
by melting curve analysis. For comparison, we used genotype data from 583 French 
controls from a previous study. In addition, we functionally analyzed the three 
variants by NFAT and SRE luciferase reporter systems as well as Western blotting 
and verified cell surface expression by ELISA.
RESULTS: In both cohorts, neither the genotype nor the allele frequencies 
differed significantly between patients and controls. In both luciferase assays, 
p.R990G showed a significant leftward shift, indicating an increased 
responsiveness of the receptor. p.A986S showed a leftward shift in the SRE but 
not in the NFAT reporter assay, while the responsiveness of p.Q1011E did not 
differ from the wild-type. These functional studies therefore do not support the 
contributions of variant CASR to increasing the risk of pancreatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: The three frequent CASR polymorphisms are unlikely to increase the 
risk for chronic pancreatitis.
