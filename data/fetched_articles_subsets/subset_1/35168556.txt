BACKGROUND: Wucai suffers from low temperature during the growth period, 
resulting in a decline in yield and poor quality. But the molecular mechanisms 
of cold tolerance in wucai are still unclear.
RESULTS: According to the phenotypes and physiological indexes, we screened out 
the cold-tolerant genotype "W18" (named CT) and cold-sensitive genotype "Sw-1" 
(named CS) in six wucai genotypes. We performed transcriptomic analysis using 
seedling leaves after 24 h of cold treatment. A total of 3536 and 3887 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the low 
temperature (LT) and control (NT) comparative transcriptome in CT and CS, 
respectively, with 1690 DEGs specific to CT. The gene ontology (GO) analysis 
showed that the response to cadmium ion (GO:0,046,686), response to jasmonic 
acid (GO:0,009,753), and response to wounding (GO:0,009,611) were enriched in CT 
(LT vs NT). The DEGs were enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism and 
glutathione metabolism in both groups, and α-linolenic acid metabolism was 
enriched only in CT (LT vs NT). DEGs in these processes, including glutathione 
S-transferases (GSTs), 13S lipoxygenase (LOX), and jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ), 
as well as transcription factors (TFs), such as the ethylene-responsive 
transcription factor 53 (ERF53), basic helix-loop-helix 92 (bHLH92), WRKY53, and 
WRKY54.We hypothesize that these genes play important roles in the response to 
cold stress in this species.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data for wucai is consistent with previous studies that suggest 
starch and sucrose metabolism increased the content of osmotic substances, and 
the glutathione metabolism pathway enhance the active oxygen scavenging. These 
two pathways may participated in response to cold stress. In addition, the 
activation of α-linolenic acid metabolism may promote the synthesis of methyl 
jasmonate (MeJA), which might also play a role in the cold tolerance of wucai.
