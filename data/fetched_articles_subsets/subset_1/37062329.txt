Pancreatic cancer (PC) has a poor prognosis, and current therapeutic strategies 
are ineffective in advanced diseases. We and others have shown the aberrant 
expression of CXCR2 and its ligands in PC development and progression. Our 
objective for this study was to evaluate the therapeutic utility of CXCR2/1 
targeting using an small molecule antagonist, SCH-479833, in different PC 
preclinical murine models (syngeneic or xenogeneic). Our results demonstrate 
that CXCR2/1 antagonist had both antitumor and anti-metastatic effects in PC. 
CXCR2/1 antagonist treatment inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration, 
angiogenesis, and recruitment of neutrophils, while it increased apoptosis. 
Treatment with the antagonist enhanced fibrosis, tumor necrosis, and 
extramedullary hematopoiesis. Together, these findings suggest that selectively 
targeting CXCR2/1 with small molecule inhibitors is a promising therapeutic 
approach for inhibiting PC growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis.
