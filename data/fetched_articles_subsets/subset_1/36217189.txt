BACKGROUND: Marine algae are responsible for half of the global primary 
production, converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds like carbohydrates. 
Particularly in eutrophic waters, they can grow into massive algal blooms. This 
polysaccharide rich biomass represents a cheap and abundant renewable carbon 
source. In nature, the diverse group of polysaccharides is decomposed by highly 
specialized microbial catabolic systems. We elucidated the complete degradation 
pathway of the green algae-specific polysaccharide ulvan in previous studies 
using a toolbox of enzymes discovered in the marine flavobacterium Formosa 
agariphila and recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli.
RESULTS: In this study we show that ulvan from algal biomass can be used as 
feedstock for a biotechnological production strain using recombinantly expressed 
carbohydrate-active enzymes. We demonstrate that Bacillus licheniformis is able 
to grow on ulvan-derived xylose-containing oligosaccharides. Comparative growth 
experiments with different ulvan hydrolysates and physiological proteogenomic 
analyses indicated that analogues of the F. agariphila ulvan lyase and an 
unsaturated β-glucuronylhydrolase are missing in B. licheniformis. We reveal 
that the heterologous expression of these two marine enzymes in B. licheniformis 
enables an efficient conversion of the algal polysaccharide ulvan as carbon and 
energy source.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the physiological capability of the 
industrially relevant bacterium B. licheniformis to grow on ulvan. We present a 
metabolic engineering strategy to enable ulvan-based biorefinery processes using 
this bacterial cell factory. With this study, we provide a stepping stone for 
the development of future bioprocesses with Bacillus using the abundant marine 
renewable carbon source ulvan.
