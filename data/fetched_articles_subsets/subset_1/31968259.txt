Piezo1 ion channels are activated by mechanical stimuli and mediate the sensing 
of blood flow. Although cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have 
revealed the overall architecture of Piezo1, the precise domains involved in 
activation and subsequent inactivation have remained elusive. Here, we perform a 
targeted chimeric screen between Piezo1 and the closely related isoform Piezo2 
and use electrophysiology to characterize their inactivation kinetics during 
mechanical stimulation. We identify three small subdomains within the 
extracellular cap that individually can confer the distinct kinetics of 
inactivation of Piezo2 onto Piezo1. We further show by cysteine crosslinking 
that conformational flexibility of these subdomains is required for mechanical 
activation to occur and that electrostatic interactions functionally couple the 
cap to the extensive blades, which have been proposed to function as sensors of 
membrane curvature and tension. This study provides a demonstration of internal 
gating motions involved in mechanotransduction by Piezo1.
