The order and timing of cell-cycle events is controlled by changing substrate 
specificity and different activity thresholds of cyclin-dependent kinases 
(CDKs). However, it is not understood how a single protein kinase can trigger 
hundreds of switches in a sufficiently time-resolved fashion. We show that 
cyclin-Cdk1-Cks1-dependent phosphorylation of multisite targets in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae is controlled by key substrate parameters including distances between 
phosphorylation sites, distribution of serines and threonines as 
phosphoacceptors and positioning of cyclin-docking motifs. The component 
mediating the key interactions in this process is Cks1, the phosphoadaptor 
subunit of the cyclin-Cdk1-Cks1 complex. We propose that variation of these 
parameters within networks of phosphorylation sites in different targets 
provides a wide range of possibilities for differential amplification of Cdk1 
signals, thus providing a mechanism to generate a wide range of thresholds in 
the cell cycle.
