BACKGROUND: Segmental handling of sodium along the proximal and distal nephron 
might be heritable and different between black and white participants.
METHODS: We randomly recruited 95 nuclear families of black South African 
ancestry and 103 nuclear families of white Belgian ancestry. We measured the 
(FENa) and estimated the fractional renal sodium reabsorption in the proximal 
(RNaprox) and distal (RNadist) tubules from the clearances of endogenous lithium 
and creatinine. In multivariable analyses, we studied the relation of RNaprox 
and RNadist with FENa and estimated the heritability (h) of RNaprox and RNadist.
RESULTS: Independent of urinary sodium excretion, South Africans (n = 240) had 
higher RNaprox (unadjusted median, 93.9% vs. 81.0%; P < 0.001) than Belgians (n 
= 737), but lower RNadist (91.2% vs. 95.1%; P < 0.001). The slope of RNaprox on 
FENa was steeper in Belgians than in South Africans (-5.40 +/- 0.58 vs. -0.78 
+/- 0.58 units; P < 0.001), whereas the opposite was true for the slope of 
RNadist on FENa (-3.84 +/- 0.19 vs. -13.71 +/- 1.30 units; P < 0.001). h of 
RNaprox and RNadist was high and significant (P < 0.001) in both countries. h 
was higher in South Africans than in Belgians for RNaprox (0.82 vs. 0.56; P < 
0.001), but was similar for RNadist (0.68 vs. 0.50; P = 0.17). Of the filtered 
sodium load, black participants reabsorb more than white participants in the 
proximal nephron and less postproximally.
CONCLUSION: Segmental sodium reabsorption along the nephron is highly heritable, 
but the capacity for regulation in the proximal and postproximal tubules differs 
between whites and blacks.
