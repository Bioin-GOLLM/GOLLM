microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial for posttranscriptional regulation of messenger 
RNAs. "Classical" miRNA targets predominantly interact with the miRNA seed 
sequence located near the miRNA 5' end. Interestingly, certain transcripts that 
exhibit extensive complementarity to the miRNAs 3' region, instead of being 
subjected to regulation, induce miRNA decay in a process termed target-directed 
miRNA degradation (TDMD). Here, we review recent advances in understanding the 
molecular mechanisms of TDMD. Specifically, we discuss how extensive miRNA 
complementarity to TDMD-inducing targets results in displacement of the miRNA 3' 
end from its protective pocket in the Argonaute protein. Unprotected miRNA 3' 
ends are then available for enzymatic attack by still-unidentified cellular 
enzymes. Identification of these cellular enzymes and discovery of additional 
TDMD-inducing transcripts are subjects for future research.
