G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins play key roles 
in GPCR and non-GPCR cellular responses. In fact, GRKs and arrestins are 
involved in a plethora of pathways vital for physiological maintenance of inter- 
and intracellular communication. Here we review decades of research literature 
spanning from the discovery, identification of key structural elements, and 
findings supporting the diverse roles of these proteins in GPCR-mediated 
pathways. We then describe how GRK2 and β-arrestins partake in non-GPCR 
signaling and briefly summarize their involvement in various pathologies. We 
conclude by presenting gaps in knowledge and our prospective on the promising 
pharmacological potential in targeting these proteins and/or downstream 
signaling. Future research is warranted and paramount for untangling these novel 
and promising roles for GRK2 and arrestins in metabolism and disease 
progression.
