Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have been associated with the 
development of Parkinson's disease (PD). An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) 
line was generated from a 60-year old patient diagnosed with PD and carrying a 
new mutation variant p.R301C in GBA. Using non-integrating Sendai virus-based 
technology, we utilized OCT3/4, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 transcription factors to 
reprogram skin fibroblasts into iPSCs. The generated iPSC line retained the 
mutation, displayed expression of common pluripotency markers, differentiated 
into the three germ layers, and exhibited normal karyotype. The iPSC line can be 
further used for studying PD pathogenesis.
