CD8 T and NK cells mediate killing by delivery of perforin and granzyme B (GZB) 
stored in lysosome-like granules. We present a flow-cytometry-based protocol 
combined with a redirected killing assay to evaluate granule exocytosis and the 
cytotoxic potential of human CD8 T cells and NK cells. We describe the 
assessment of the delivered GZB inside the target cells. We then detail the 
detection of lysosome membrane protein CD107a exposed on the cell surface of the 
effector cells upon degranulation. For complete details on the use and execution 
of this protocol, please refer to Chen et al. (2021).1.
