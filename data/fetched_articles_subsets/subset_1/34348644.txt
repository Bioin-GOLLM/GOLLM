BACKGROUND: The mutation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2 mutation) that a 
single-nucleotide substitution (G→A) in the third intron of IGF2 abrogates the 
interaction with zinc finger BED-type containing 6 (ZBED6) and leads to 
increased muscle mass in pigs. IGF2 mutation knock-in (IGF2 KI) and ZBED6 
knockout (ZBED6 KO) lead to changes in IGF2 expression and increase muscle mass 
in mice and pigs. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may participate in numerous 
biological processes, including skeletal muscle development. However, the role 
of the ZBED6-lncRNA axis in skeletal muscle development is poorly characterized.
RESULTS: In this study, we assembled transcriptomes using RNA-seq data published 
in previous studies by our group and identified 11,408 known lncRNAs and 2269 
potential lncRNAs in seven tissues, heart, longissimus dorsi, gastrocnemius 
muscle, liver, spleen, lung and kidney, of ZBED6 KO (lean mass model) and WT 
Bama pigs. ZBED6 affected the expression of 1570 lncRNAs (differentially 
expressed lncRNAs [DE-lncRNAs]; log2-fold change ≥ 1, nominal p-value ≤ 0.05) in 
the seven examined tissues. The expressed lncRNAs (FPKM > 0.1) exhibited 
tissue-specific patterns in WT pigs. Specifically, 3410 lncRNAs were expressed 
exclusively in only one tissue. Potential functions of lncRNAs were indirectly 
predicted by searching their target cis- and trans-regulated protein-coding 
genes. LncRNAs with tissue-specific expression influence numerous genes related 
to tissue functions. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of 1570 
DE-lncRNAs between WT and ZBED6 KO pigs was used to define the following six 
lncRNA modules specific to different tissues: skeletal muscle, heart, lung, 
spleen, kidney and liver modules. Furthermore, by conjoint analysis of 
longissimus dorsi data (tissue-specific expression, muscle module and 
DE-lncRNAs) and ChIP-PCR revealed NONSUSG002145.1 (adjusted p-values = 0.044), 
which is coexpressed with the IGF2 gene and binding with ZBED6, may play 
important roles in ZBED6 KO pig skeletal muscle development.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the identified lncRNAs may play 
essential roles in tissue function and regulate the mechanism of ZBED6 action in 
skeletal muscle development in pigs. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
describing lncRNAs in ZBED6 KO pigs. These results may open new research 
directions leading to a better understanding of the global functions of ZBED6 
and of lncRNA functions in skeletal muscle development in pigs.
