INTRODUCTION: Description of the global expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and 
proteins in healthy human term placentas may increase our knowledge of molecular 
biological pathways that are important for normal fetal growth and development 
in term pregnancy. The aim of this study was to explore the global expression of 
miRNAs and proteins, and to point out functions of importance in healthy term 
placentas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Placental samples (n = 19) were identified in a local 
biobank. All samples were from uncomplicated term pregnancies with vaginal 
births and healthy, normal weight newborns. Next-generation sequencing and 
nano-scale liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry were used to analyse 
miRNA and protein expression, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 895 mature miRNAs and 6,523 proteins were detected in the 
placentas, of which 123 miRNAs and 346 proteins were highly abundant. The miRNAs 
were in high degree mapped to chromosomes 19, 14, and X. Analysis of the highly 
abundant miRNAs and proteins showed several significantly predicted functions in 
common, including immune and inflammatory response, lipid metabolism and 
development of the nervous system.
DISCUSSION: The predicted function inflammatory response may reflect normal 
vaginal delivery, while lipid metabolism and neurodevelopment may be important 
processes for the term fetus. The data presented in this study, with complete 
miRNA and protein findings, will enhance the knowledge base for future research 
in the field of placental function and pathology.
