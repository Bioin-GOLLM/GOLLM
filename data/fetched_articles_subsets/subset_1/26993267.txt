BACKGROUND: We sought to investigate the diagnostic yield and mutation spectrum 
in previously reported genes for early-onset epilepsy and disorders of severe 
developmental delay.
METHODS: In 400 patients with these disorders with no known underlying aetiology 
and no major structural brain anomaly, we analysed 46 genes using a combination 
of targeted sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform and targeted, exon-level 
microarray copy number analysis.
RESULTS: We identified causative mutations in 71/400 patients (18%). The 
diagnostic rate was highest among those with seizure onset within the first two 
months of life (39%), although overall it was similar in those with and without 
seizures. The most frequently mutated gene was SCN2A (11 patients, 3%). Other 
recurrently mutated genes included CDKL5, KCNQ2, SCN8A (six patients each), 
FOXG1, MECP2, SCN1A, STXBP1 (five patients each), KCNT1, PCDH19, TCF4 (three 
patients each) and ATP1A3, PRRT2 and SLC9A6 (two patients each). Mutations in 
EHMT1, GABRB3, LGI1, MBD5, PIGA, UBE3A and ZEB2 were each found in single 
patients. We found mutations in a number of genes in patients where either the 
electroclinical features or dysmorphic phenotypes were atypical for the 
identified gene. In only 11 cases (15%) had the clinician sufficient certainty 
to specify the mutated gene as the likely cause before testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the considerable utility of a gene panel 
approach in the diagnosis of patients with early-onset epilepsy and severe 
developmental delay disorders., They provide further insights into the 
phenotypic spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations for a number of the 
causative genes and emphasise the value of exon-level copy number testing in 
their analysis.
