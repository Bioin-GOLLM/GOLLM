PURPOSE: Congenital growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is a rare and etiologically 
heterogeneous disease. We aim to screen disease-causing mutations of GHD in a 
relatively sizable cohort and discover underlying mechanisms via a candidate 
gene-based mutational burden analysis.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 109 short stature patients associated with 
hormone deficiency. All patients were classified into two groups: Group I (n=45) 
with definitive GHD and Group II (n=64) with possible GHD. We analyzed 
correlation consistency between clinical criteria and molecular findings by 
whole exome sequencing (WES) in two groups. The patients without a molecular 
diagnosis (n=90) were compared with 942 in-house controls for the mutational 
burden of rare mutations in 259 genes biologically related with the GH axis.
RESULTS: In 19 patients with molecular diagnosis, we found 5 possible GHD 
patients received known molecular diagnosis associated with GHD (NF1 [c.2329T>A, 
c.7131C>G], GHRHR [c.731G>A], STAT5B [c.1102delC], HRAS [c.187_207dup]). By 
mutational burden analysis of predicted deleterious variants in 90 patients 
without molecular diagnosis, we found that POLR3A (p = 0.005), SUFU (p = 0.006), 
LHX3 (p = 0.021) and CREB3L4 (p = 0.040) represented top genes enriched in GHD 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the discrepancies between the laboratory testing 
and molecular diagnosis of GHD. These differences should be considered when for 
an accurate diagnosis of GHD. We also identified four candidate genes that might 
be associated with GHD.
