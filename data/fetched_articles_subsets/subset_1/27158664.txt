Neuroferritinopathy is a rare autosomal dominant movement disorder caused by 
mutations of the FTL gene.(1) It is clinically characterized by adult-onset 
progressive extrapyramidal syndrome, including chorea, dystonia, and 
parkinsonism.(2) Brain MRI demonstrates the deposition of iron and ferritin in 
the basal ganglia.(3) To date, several Caucasian families and 2 Japanese 
families have been reported worldwide.(2) We present a Chinese 
neuroferritinopathy pedigree with 5 patients and the FTL mutation.
