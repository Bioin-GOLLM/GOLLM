BACKGROUND: Glutaminase 1 is a phosphate-activated metabolic enzyme that 
catalyzes the first step of glutaminolysis, which converts glutamine into 
glutamate. Glutamate is the major neurotransmitter of excitatory synapses, 
executing important physiological functions in the central nervous system. There 
are two isoforms of glutaminase 1, KGA and GAC, both of which are generated 
through alternative splicing from the same gene. KGA and GAC both transcribe 
1-14 exons in the N-terminal, but each has its unique C-terminal in the coding 
sequence. We have previously identified that KGA and GAC are differentially 
regulated during inflammatory stimulation and HIV infection. Furthermore, 
glutaminase 1 has been linked to brain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and hepatic encephalopathy. Core enzyme 
structure of KGA and GAC has been published recently. However, how other coding 
sequences affect their functional enzyme activity remains unclear.
METHODS: We cloned and performed serial deletions of human full-length KGA and 
GAC from the N-terminal and the C-terminal at an interval of approximately 100 
amino acids (AAs). Prokaryotic expressions of the mutant glutaminase 1 protein 
and a glutaminase enzyme activity assay were used to determine if KGA and GAC 
have similar efficiency and efficacy to convert glutamine into glutamate.
RESULTS: When 110 AAs or 218 AAs were deleted from the N-terminal or when the 
unique portions of KGA and GAC that are beyond the 550 AA were deleted from the 
C-terminal, KGA and GAC retained enzyme activity comparable to the full length 
proteins. In contrast, deletion of 310 AAs or more from N-terminal or deletion 
of 450 AAs or more from C-terminal resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity 
for KGA/GAC. Consistently, when both N- and C-terminal of the KGA and GAC were 
removed, creating a truncated protein that expressed the central 219 AA - 550 
AA, the protein retained enzyme activity. Furthermore, expression of the core 
219 AA - 550 AA coding sequence in cells increased extracellular glutamate 
concentrations to levels comparable to those of full-length KGA and GAC 
expressions, suggesting that the core enzyme activity of the protein lies within 
the central 219 AA - 550 AA. Full-length KGA and GAC retained enzyme activities 
when kept at 4 °C. In contrast, 219 AA - 550 AA truncated protein lost 
glutaminase activities more readily compared with full-length KGA and GAC, 
suggesting that the N-terminal and C-terminal coding regions are required for 
the stability KGA and GAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Glutaminase isoforms KGA and GAC have similar efficacy to catalyze 
the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. The core enzyme activity of 
glutaminase 1 protein is within the central 219 AA - 550 AA. The N-terminal and 
C-terminal coding regions of KGA and GAC help maintain the long-term activities 
of the enzymes.
