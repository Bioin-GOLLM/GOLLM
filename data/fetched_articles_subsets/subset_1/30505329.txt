BACKGROUND: Increased levels of reactive oxygen species is a key factor involved 
in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is 
a nonenzymatic antioxidant that restores other antioxidants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial 
study has been designed to evaluate the effects of CoQ10 supplementation on 
serum values of amylase, adenosine deaminase, catalase (CAT), total antioxidant 
capacity (TAC) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) in 
women with T2DM. Serum levels of CoQ10 were measured too. Sixty-eight women with 
T2DM were enrolled in this study and randomly divided into two groups. One group 
received 100 mg/day of CoQ10 supplement for 12 weeks (n = 34), and the other 
group was given placebo for the same time duration and dosage (n = 34).
RESULTS: After the intervention, serum CAT activity (P < 0.001), TAC (P = 
0.006), CoQ10 (P = 0.001), and QUICKI (P = 0.005) increased and fasting blood 
sugar (FBS) (P = 0.05) decreased significantly in CoQ10 group.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that daily supplementation with 100 mg of CoQ10 
could increase TAC and CAT activity as, CoQ10 and QUICKI and could reduce 
oxidative stress and FBS in women with T2DM.
