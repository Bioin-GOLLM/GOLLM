BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory disorder of the upper 
airway. T-helper (Th)2 cytokines seems to have major roles behind the scene of 
unpleasant symptoms resulted from AR. Expression of interleukin (IL)-4 and its 
receptor could be affected by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This study 
assessed the effect of 4 genetic variants within genes of IL-4 and IL-4R in AR.
METHODS: Allele frequencies of one IL-4R variant (rs1801275) and three SNPs of 
IL-4 (rs2243248, rs2243250, and rs2070874) were investigated in 98 patients with 
AR, compared to a group of controls, using PCR sequence-specific-primers 
(PCR-SSP) method.
RESULTS: Homozygosity for the C allele of rs2243250 in IL-4 was significantly 
overrepresented in the patient group. CC genotype in rs2070874 significantly was 
correlated with AR. GG/CC/CC and TT/TT/TT (rs2243248, rs2243250, and rs2070874) 
haplotypes in the IL-4 gene had a significant negative correlation with AR.
CONCLUSION: SNPs in IL-4 are associated with AR and could change the clinical 
picture of the disease in patients.
