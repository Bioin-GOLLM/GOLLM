INTRODUCTION: Focal ground-glass opacity on computed tomography suggests several 
disorders including inflammatory disease, fibrosis, or a primary lung neoplastic 
lesion, metastatic lung tumor.
CASE PRESENTATION: The case of a 55-year-old female presenting with 
adenocarcinoma of the lung is herein reported. Computed tomography of the chest 
revealed a primary mass lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung and multiple 
metastases presenting as ground-glass opacities. Macroscopic metastases were 
observed in the bone, the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and another lobe. 
This case was advanced lung cancer. We assumed that the multiple ground-glass 
opacity lesions were metastasis in the lungs. Chest CT revealed a partial 
response of the primary site and the multiple ground-glass opacities after 
systemic chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: A metastatic lung tumor showing ground-glass opacity is uncommon. It 
is quite difficult to distinguish between multiple primary lung cancers and 
intrapulmonary metastasis when patients present with multiple lung nodules. A 
lot of clinical information is therefore required to make an accurate diagnosis 
in such cases.
