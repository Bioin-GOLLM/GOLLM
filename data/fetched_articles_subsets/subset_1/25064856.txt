In vertebrates, smooth muscle cells (SMCs) can reversibly switch between 
contractile and proliferative phenotypes. This involves various molecular 
mechanisms to reactivate developmental signaling pathways and induce cell 
dedifferentiation. The protein RBPMS2 regulates early development and plasticity 
of digestive SMCs by inhibiting the bone morphogenetic protein pathway through 
its interaction with NOGGIN mRNA. RBPMS2 contains only one RNA recognition motif 
(RRM) while this motif is often repeated in tandem or associated with other 
functional domains in RRM-containing proteins. Herein, we show using an 
extensive combination of structure/function analyses that RBPMS2 homodimerizes 
through a particular sequence motif (D-x-K-x-R-E-L-Y-L-L-F: residues 39-51) 
located in its RRM domain. We also show that this specific motif is conserved 
among its homologs and paralogs in vertebrates and in its insect and worm 
orthologs (CPO and MEC-8, respectively) suggesting a conserved molecular 
mechanism of action. Inhibition of the dimerization process through targeting a 
conserved leucine inside of this motif abolishes the capacity of RBPMS2 to 
interact with the translational elongation eEF2 protein, to upregulate NOGGIN 
mRNA in vivo and to drive SMC dedifferentiation. Our study demonstrates that 
RBPMS2 possesses an RRM domain harboring both RNA-binding and protein-binding 
properties and that the newly identified RRM-homodimerization motif is crucial 
for the function of RBPMS2 at the cell and tissue levels.
