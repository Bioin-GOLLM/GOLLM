OBJECTIVES: Estimate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation 
prevalence in all non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and patient 
subgroups.
RESULTS: A total of 456 studies were included, reporting 30,466 patients with 
EGFR mutation among 115,815 NSCLC patients. The overall pooled prevalence for 
EGFR mutations was 32.3% (95% CI 30.9% to 33.7%), ranging from 38.4% (95% CI: 
36.5% to 40.3%) in China to 14.1% (95% CI: 12.7% to 15.5%) in Europe. The pooled 
prevalence of EGFR mutation was higher in females (females vs. males: 43.7% vs. 
24.0%; OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.5 to 2.9), non-smokers (non-smokers vs. past or 
current smokers: 49.3% vs. 21.5%; OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 3.4 to 4.0), and patients 
with adenocarcinoma (adenocarcinoma vs. non-adenocarcinoma: 38.0% vs. 11.7%; OR: 
4.1, 95% CI: 3.6 to 4.8).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to 
June 2013. Eligible studies reported EGFR mutation prevalence and the 
association with at least one of the following factors: gender, smoking status 
and histology. Random-effects models were used to pool EGFR mutation prevalence 
data.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the exact prevalence of EGFR mutations in 
different countries and NSCLC patient subgroups.
