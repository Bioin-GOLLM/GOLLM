BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported the relation between MTLRP genetic 
polymorphism and type 2 diabetes, however, the conclusion were conflicting. In 
the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to reveal this association.
METHODS: Literature retrieval, selection and assessment, data extraction, and 
meta-analyses were performed according to the RevMan 5.0 guidelines. In the 
meta-analysis, we utilized random-effect model or fixed-effect model to pool the 
Odds ratio (OR) according to the test of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: A total of nine case-control studies included 4460 type 2 diabetes 
patients and 4114 healthy control subjects were analyzed. We did not found 
association between the MTLRP polymorphism and type 2 diabetes risk in the 
overall population (CC vs CA + AA: OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.89-1.17, P = 0.77; A vs 
C: OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.84-0.96, P = 0.62). However, in subgroup analyses 
stratified by ethnicity, we found significant association of MTLRP polymorphism 
with type 2 diabetes in Caucasians (CC vs CA + AA: OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.02-1.57, 
P = 0.03; A vs C: OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91, P = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: The MTLRP polymorphism was associated with type 2 diabetes in 
Caucasians.
