OBJECTIVES: Although the costs associated with whole-genome and whole-exome 
next-generation sequencing continue to decline, they remain prohibitively 
expensive for large-scale studies of genetic variation. As an alternative, 
custom-target sequencing has become a common methodology on the basis of its 
favorable balance between cost, throughput, and deep coverage.
METHODS: We have developed PGRNseq, a custom-capture panel of 84 genes with 
associations to pharmacogenetic phenotypes, as a tool to explore the 
relationship between drug response and genetic variation, both common and rare. 
We utilized a set of 32 diverse HapMap trios and two clinical cohorts to assess 
platform performance, accuracy, and ability to discover novel variation.
RESULTS: We found that PGRNseq generates ultra-deep coverage data (mean=496x) 
that are over 99.8% concordant with orthogonal datasets. In addition, in our 
testing sets, PGRNseq identified many novel, rare variants of interest, 
underscoring its value in both research and clinical settings.
CONCLUSION: PGRNseq is an ideal platform for carrying out sequencing-based 
analyses of pharmacogenetic variation in large cohorts. In addition, the high 
accuracy associated with genotypes from PGRNseq highlight its utility as a 
clinical test.
