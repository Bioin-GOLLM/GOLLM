OBJECTIVE: To analyze the genotypes and phenotypes of a child with developmental 
dysplasia of the hip (DDH), developmental delays, recurrent fever, 
hypothyroidism and cleft palate.
METHODS: G-banding karyotyping analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
were performed for the patient. The genotypes of the parents of the patient were 
verified by copy number variation analysis and Sanger sequencing to determine 
the source of variations.
RESULTS: The karyotype of the patient was 46, XX. A 10.44 Mb deletion 
(chr18:67562936-78005270del) at 18q22.2q23 was found by NGS. We identified 2 
HSPG2 mutations (chr1: 22206699, c.2244C > A, exon 17, p.H748Q; chr1: 
22157321-22157321, c.11671 + 154insA, intron). One mutation was inherited from 
the father, and the other was inherited from the mother.
CONCLUSION: This is the first 18q deletion syndrome case accompanied by DDH. 
Most phenotypes of this patient, such as developmental delays and cleft palate, 
may be related to the 18q22.2q23 deletion, but no variants in genes related to 
DDH were found in this deletion region. DDH may be related to mutations of 
HSPG2.
