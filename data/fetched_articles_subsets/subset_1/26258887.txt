Most tumour cells use aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to support 
anabolic growth and evade apoptosis. Intriguingly, the molecular mechanisms that 
link the Warburg effect with the suppression of apoptosis are not well 
understood. In this study, using loss-of-function studies in vitro and in vivo, 
we show that the anti-apoptotic protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)14 
promotes aerobic glycolysis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 
maintaining low activity of the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2), a key 
regulator of the Warburg effect. Notably, PARP14 is highly expressed in HCC 
primary tumours and associated with poor patient prognosis. Mechanistically, 
PARP14 inhibits the pro-apoptotic kinase JNK1, which results in the activation 
of PKM2 through phosphorylation of Thr365. Moreover, targeting PARP14 enhances 
the sensitization of HCC cells to anti-HCC agents. Our findings indicate that 
the PARP14-JNK1-PKM2 regulatory axis is an important determinant for the Warburg 
effect in tumour cells and provide a mechanistic link between apoptosis and 
metabolism.
