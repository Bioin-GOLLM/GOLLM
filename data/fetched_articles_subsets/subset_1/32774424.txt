Abyssinone V-4' methyl ether (AVME) isolated from Erythrina droogmansiana was 
recently reported to exhibit anti-mammary tumor effect in mice. The present work 
was therefore aimed at elucidating its cellular and molecular mechanisms. To 
achieve our goal, the cytotoxicity of AVME against tumoral and non-tumoral cell 
lines was evaluated by resazurin reduction test; flow cytometry allowed us to 
evaluate the cell cycle and mechanisms of cell death; the mitochondrial 
transmembrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and caspase 
activities as well as apoptosis-regulatory proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) were 
measured in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, the antimetastatic potential of AVME was 
evaluated by invasion assay. AVME exhibited cytotoxic effects in all tested 
tumor cell lines and induced a significant increase in the percentage of 
MDA-MB-231 cells at G2/M and S phases of the cell cycle in a 
concentration-dependent manner. AVME also induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, 
which was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and 
downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. Moreover, AVME suppressed cancer 
cell invasion by the inhibition of the metalloproteinase-9 activity. Findings 
from this study suggest that AVME has anti-breast cancer activities expressed 
through mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway including impairment of aggressive 
behaviors of breast cancer cells.
