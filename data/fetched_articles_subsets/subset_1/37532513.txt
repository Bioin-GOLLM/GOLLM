A 32-year-old man was admitted for the evaluation of proteinuria (5.69 g/day). A 
light microscopic examination showed markedly dilated glomerular capillary loops 
with vacuolated areas in many glomeruli, and vacuolated areas were seen on 
peritubular capillaries in the tubulointerstitium. When electron microscopy 
specimens prepared by pre-fixation with glutaraldehyde and post-fixation with 
osmium tetroxide were used for oil red staining, the deposition was confirmed on 
the affected areas. A genetic analysis of apoE showed that the lipoprotein 
glomerulopathy was due to apoE-Sendai (Arg145Pro, p.R163P) heterozygosity, which 
was found in not only the patient but also his mother and twin brother.
