COVID-19 has highly variable clinical courses. The search for prognostic host 
factors for COVID-19 outcome is a priority. We performed logistic regression for 
ICU admission against a polygenic score (PGS) for Cystatin C (CyC) production in 
patients with COVID-19. We analyzed the predictive value of longitudinal plasma 
CyC levels in an independent cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In 
four cohorts spanning European and African ancestry populations, we identified a 
significant association between CyC-production PGS and odds of critical illness 
(n cases=2,319), with the strongest association captured in the UKB cohort (OR 
2.13, 95% CI 1.58-2.87, p=7.12e-7). Plasma proteomics from an independent cohort 
of hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n cases = 131) demonstrated that CyC 
production was associated with COVID-specific mortality (p=0.0007). Our findings 
suggest that CyC may be useful for stratification of patients and it has 
functional role in the host response to COVID-19.
