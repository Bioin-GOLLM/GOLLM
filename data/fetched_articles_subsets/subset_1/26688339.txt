Mutations in NFU1 were recently identified in patients with fatal 
encephalopathy. NFU1 is an iron-sulfur cluster protein necessary for the 
activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I-II and the synthesis 
of lipoic acid. We report two NFU1 compound heterozygous individuals with normal 
complex I and lipoic acid-dependent enzymatic activities and low, but 
detectable, levels of lipoylated proteins. We demonstrated a leaky splicing 
regulation due to a splice site mutation (c.545+5G>A) that produces small 
amounts of wild type NFU1 mRNA that might result in enough protein to partially 
lipoylate and restore the activity of lipoic acid-dependent enzymes and the 
assembly and activity of complex I. These results allowed us to gain insights 
into the molecular basis underlying this disease and should be considered for 
the diagnosis of NFU1 patients.
