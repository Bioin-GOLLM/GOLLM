Ebolavirus NP oligomerizes into helical filaments found at the core of the 
virion, encapsidates the viral RNA genome, and serves as a scaffold for 
additional viral proteins within the viral nucleocapsid. We identified a portion 
of the phosphoprotein homolog VP35 that binds with high affinity to nascent NP 
and regulates NP assembly and viral genome binding. Removal of the VP35 peptide 
leads to NP self-assembly via its N-terminal oligomerization arm. NP 
oligomerization likely causes a conformational change between the NP N- and 
C-terminal domains, facilitating RNA binding. These functional data are 
complemented by crystal structures of the NP°-VP35 complex at 2.4 Å resolution. 
The interactions between NP and VP35 illuminated by these structures are 
conserved among filoviruses and provide key targets for therapeutic 
intervention.
