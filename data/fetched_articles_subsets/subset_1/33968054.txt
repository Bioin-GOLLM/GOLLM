Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare hematological condition with 
heterogenous genetic background. Neutrophil elastase (NE) encoded by ELANE gene 
is mutated in over half of the SCN cases. The role of NE defects in myelocytes 
maturation arrest in bone marrow is widely investigated; however, the mechanism 
underlying this phenomenon has still remained unclear. In this review, we sum up 
the studies exploring mechanisms of neutrophil deficiency, biological role of NE 
in neutrophil and the effects of ELANE mutation and neutropenia pathogenesis. We 
also explain the hypotheses presented so far and summarize options of 
neutropenia therapy.
