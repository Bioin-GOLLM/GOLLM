Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) is a liver protein responsible for 
the selective retention of alpha-tocopherol from dietary vitamin E, which is a 
mixture of alpha, beta, gamma, and delta-tocopherols and the corresponding 
tocotrienols. The alpha-TTP-mediated transfer of alpha-tocopherol into nascent 
VLDL is the major determinant of plasma alpha-tocopherol levels in humans. 
Mutations in the alpha-TTP gene have been detected in patients suffering from 
low plasma alpha-tocopherol and ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency 
(AVED). The crystal structure of alpha-TTP reveals two conformations. In its 
closed tocopherol-charged form, a mobile helical surface segment seals the 
hydrophobic binding pocket. In the presence of detergents, an open conformation 
is observed, which probably represents the membrane-bound form. The selectivity 
of alpha-TTP for RRR-alpha-tocopherol is explained from the van der Waals 
contacts occurring in the lipid-binding pocket. Mapping the known mutations 
leading to AVED onto the crystal structure shows that no mutations occur 
directly in the binding pocket.
