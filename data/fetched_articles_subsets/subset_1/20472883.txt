Phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinases (PI3Ks) constitute a family of intracellular 
lipid kinases that are frequently hyperactivated in glioblastoma. The PI3K 
complex links growth factor signaling with cellular proliferation, 
differentiation, metabolism, and survival. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
acts both as a downstream effector and upstream regulator of PI3K, thus 
highlighting its importance in glioblastoma. This review highlights laboratory 
and clinical evidence of mTOR's role in glioblastoma. Mechanisms of escape from 
mTOR inhibition are also discussed, as well as future clinical strategies of 
mTOR inhibition.
