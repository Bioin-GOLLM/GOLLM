BMPR-IB gene which controls the fecundity of Booroola Merino and BMP15 gene 
which affects the ovulation of Invedale and Hanna were studied as candidate 
genes on the fecundity of Little Tailed Han Sheep, and their mutations and 
genetic effects were analyzed. The results showed that there was a same mutation 
in BMPR-IB gene (A746G) of Little Tailed Han Sheep as that of Booroola Merino. 
The BB mutation genotype was superior in prolific Little Tailed Han Sheep, and 
the ewes with genotype BB had 0.97(P < 0.05) and 1.5(P < 0.01) lambs more than 
those with genotype + + in the first parity and later parities, respectively. It 
could be inferred that BMPR-IB gene was related with the major gene that 
controls the high prolificacy of Little Tailed Han Sheep. While there was not 
mutation of V31D or Q23Ter in BMP15 gene of Little Tailed Han Sheep, it showed 
that the fecundity mechanism of Little Tailed Han Sheep was different from that 
of Romney sheep. Then it was ruled out the possibility that the ovulation of 
Little Tailed Han Sheep was affected by the mutation of BMP15 gene.
