BACKGROUND: Due to prolonged survival and technical advances in CT imaging, 
cardiac metastases in patients with malignant melanoma are observed more 
frequently nowadays. The aim of the present study was to assess the anatomic 
distribution as well as the morphologic and histologic appearance of cardiac 
metastases from malignant melanoma.
METHODS: Twenty five patients with known metastasized melanoma and with 
incidental finding of cardiac metastases during routine staging CT were 
retrospectively included in this study. CT images were assessed for the 
presence, localization and extent of cardiac metastases. Histological results, 
mutational analysis and tumor markers were reviewed.
RESULTS: Fourteen out of 25 patients presented with singular cardiac mass (56%), 
whereas ten patients (40%) presented with multifocal and one patient with 
disseminated cardiac metastases. Twelve patients presented with endocardial 
(48%), eight with myocardial and two with pericardial metastases. Most frequent 
site involved in endocardial metastases was the right atrium (67%) followed by 
the right ventricle (33%). There seems to be a correlation between histological 
subtype and location of cardiac metastasis. Median survival after diagnosis of 
cardiac metastases was 8 months, with no significant difference regarding the 
localization of metastases within the heart.
CONCLUSION: Cardiac metastases can involve every part of the heart possibly in 
dependence of histological subtype. The awareness of different types of cardiac 
metastases and their characteristic appearance on CT images is necessary for 
further investigations and might contribute to targeted therapy.
