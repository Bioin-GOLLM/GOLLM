4-1BB (CD137) is an activation-induced costimulatory receptor that regulates 
immune responses of activated CD8 T and natural killer cells, by enhancing 
proliferation, survival, cytolytic activity, and IFNγ production. The ability to 
induce potent antitumor activity by stimulating 4-1BB on tumor-specific 
cytotoxic T cells makes 4-1BB an attractive target for designing novel 
immuno-oncology therapeutics. To minimize systemic immune toxicities and enhance 
activity at the tumor site, we have developed a novel bispecific antibody that 
stimulates 4-1BB function when co-engaged with the tumor-associated antigen 5T4. 
ALG.APV-527 was built on the basis of the ADAPTIR bispecific platform with 
optimized binding domains to 4-1BB and 5T4 originating from the ALLIGATOR-GOLD 
human single-chain variable fragment library. The epitope of ALG.APV-527 was 
determined to be located at domain 1 and 2 on 4-1BB using X-ray crystallography. 
As shown in reporter and primary cell assays in vitro, ALG.APV-527 triggers 
dose-dependent 4-1BB activity mediated only by 5T4 crosslinking. In vivo, 
ALG.APV-527 demonstrates robust antitumor responses, by inhibiting growth of 
established tumors expressing human 5T4 followed by a long-lasting memory immune 
response. ALG.APV-527 has an antibody-like half-life in cynomolgus macaques and 
was well tolerated at 50.5 mg/kg. ALG.APV-527 is uniquely designed for 
5T4-conditional 4-1BB-mediated antitumor activity with potential to minimize 
systemic immune activation and hepatotoxicity while providing efficacious 
tumor-specific responses in a range of 5T4-expressing tumor indications as shown 
by robust activity in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. On the basis of 
the combined preclinical dataset, ALG.APV-527 has potential as a promising 
anticancer therapeutic for the treatment of 5T4-expressing tumors.
