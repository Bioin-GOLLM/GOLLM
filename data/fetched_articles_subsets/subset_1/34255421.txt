OBJECTIVES: Non-syndromic cleft palate only (NSCPO) is a common congenital 
deformity with complex etiologies. GRHL3, FAF1, and KCNJ2 have been reported to 
be involved in the pathogenesis of NSCPO. Up till now, there have been no 
replication studies based on large Han Chinese. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate associations between GRHL3, FAF1, KCNJ2, and NSCPO sub-phenotypes 
patients in Han Chinese.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, we selected 2 SNPs based on previous 
literatures: FAF1 (rs3827730) and GRHL3 (rs41268753). Also, we selected 8 
tagSNPs in GRHL3 (rs557811, rs609352, rs10903078, rs6659209, rs12401714, 
rs12568599, rs3887581, rs12024148) and 2 tagSNPs in KCNJ2 (rs75855040 and 
rs236514). Afterward, we evaluated these SNPs among 1668 NSCPO patients and 1811 
normal controls from Han Chinese. Following data were analyzed by PLINK and 
Haploview program.
RESULTS: Association analysis under additive model showed that allele A at 
rs12568599 in GRHL3 gene is significantly associated with NSCPO (p = 0.0034, OR 
= 1.38 and 95%CI: 1.11-1.72) and its sub-phenotype incomplete cleft palate (ICP) 
(p = 0.0039, OR = 1.4 and 95%CI: 1.11-1.75), and it could increase the risk of 
both NSCPO and ICP.
CONCLUSIONS: This study firstly found that rs12568599 in GRHL3 is associated 
with NSCPO and ICP in Han Chinese, indicating that sub-phenotypes of NSCPO have 
different etiologies.
