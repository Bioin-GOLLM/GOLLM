The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) mediates host cell fusion and is the 
primary target for HIV-1 vaccine design. The Env undergoes a series of 
functionally important conformational rearrangements upon engagement of its host 
cell receptor, CD4. As the sole target for broadly neutralizing antibodies, our 
understanding of these transitions plays a critical role in vaccine immunogen 
design. Here, we review available experimental data interrogating the HIV-1 Env 
conformation and detail computational efforts aimed at delineating the series of 
conformational changes connecting these rearrangements. These studies have 
provided a structural mapping of prefusion closed, open, and transition 
intermediate structures, the allosteric elements controlling rearrangements, and 
state-to-state transition dynamics. The combination of these investigations and 
innovations in molecular modeling set the stage for advanced studies examining 
rearrangements at greater spatial and temporal resolution.
