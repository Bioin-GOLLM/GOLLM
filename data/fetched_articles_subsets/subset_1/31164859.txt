Background and Objectives: Studies examining the risk factors for dyskinesia in 
Parkinson's disease (PD) have been inconsistent, and racial differences exist. 
Since there have been no systematic studies of the characteristics of dyskinesia 
in the Mainland Chinese population, we sought to elucidate the risk factors for 
dyskinesia. Methods: A total of 1974 PD patients from Mainland China were 
systematically investigated by univariable and multivariable analyses. PD 
patients with and without dyskinesia were stratified into 4 groups according to 
levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) and analyzed by a Cox proportional hazards 
model. A longitudinal study of 87 patients with dyskinesia was classified into 3 
groups according to the duration from onset of PD to the initiation of levodopa, 
and comparisons among groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. Results: 
Early age of onset, long disease duration, being female, high LEDD, low UPDRS 
III scores (ON-state) and high Hoehn-Yahr stage (ON-state) were predictors of 
dyskinesia. Dyskinesia was levodopa dosage-dependent, and the incidence 
increased remarkably when LEDD exceeded 300 mg/d (p < 0.05). The emergence of 
dyskinesia had no association with the initiation time of levodopa, and if the 
latter was more than 4 years, the duration of time on chronic levodopa free of 
motor complications was significantly shortened. Conclusions: We found risk 
factors for the prediction of dyskinesia. Our data shows that physicians should 
be cautious if the LEDD exceeds 300 mg/d. The development of dyskinesia was not 
correlated with the time of levodopa initiation.
