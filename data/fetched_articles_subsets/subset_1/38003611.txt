Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of depressive disorder 
constitutes a pressing challenge in the fields of psychiatry and neurobiology. 
Depression represents one of the most prevalent forms of mental and behavioral 
disorders globally. Alterations in dimerization capacity can influence the 
functional characteristics of serotonin receptors and may constitute a 
contributing factor to the onset of depressive disorders. The objective of this 
review is to consolidate the current understanding of interactions within the 
5-HT receptor family and between 5-HT receptors and members of other receptor 
families. Furthermore, it aims to elucidate the role of such complexes in 
depressive disorders and delineate the mechanisms through which antidepressants 
exert their effects.
