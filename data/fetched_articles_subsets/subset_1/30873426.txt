Higher-order chromatin organization shaped by epigenetic modifications influence 
the chromatin environment and subsequently regulate gene expression. Direct 
visualization of the higher-order chromatin structure at their epigenomic states 
is of great importance for understanding chromatin compaction and its subsequent 
effect on gene expression and various cellular processes. With the recent 
advances in super-resolution microscopy, the higher-order chromatin structure 
can now be directly visualized in situ down to the scale of ~30 nm. This 
protocol provides detailed description of super-resolution imaging of 
higher-order chromatin structure using stochastic optical reconstruction 
microscopy (STORM). We discussed fluorescence staining methods of DNA and 
histone proteins and crucial technical factors to obtain high-quality 
super-resolution images.
