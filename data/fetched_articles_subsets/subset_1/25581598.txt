CONTEXT: Inactivating mutations have been reported in subjects with 
primary/secondary amenorrhea, whereas activating mutations are rare and seen 
only in women with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). In the present 
study, we describe the functional characterization of the two mutations 
Val(514)Ala (novel mutation) and Ala(575)Val in FSH receptor (FSHR) identified 
in women with OHSS developed during in vitro fertilization and primary 
amenorrhea, respectively.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the investigation was to study the effect of 
mutations (514 and 575) on FSHR activity by in vitro functional studies.
SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic research institute and a private 
in vitro fertilization clinic.
METHODS: The site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to generate the mutations 
at position 514 and 575 in pSG5-FSHR construct. Stable cell lines expressing 
wild type or each of the mutant receptor were generated using Chinese hamster 
ovary cells. Functional characteristics of both the mutant receptors were 
assessed by a radioreceptor assay and a cAMP assay.
RESULTS: The mutant receptor 514 showed increased cell surface expression as 
compared with the wild-type (WT) receptor. Although the hormone binding 
characteristics were similar to the WT receptor, its signaling activity was 
distinctly higher at lower dose of FSH as monitored by a cAMP assay. On the 
other hand, the mutant receptor 575 showed lower cell surface expression and 
higher internalized hormone receptor complex. Additionally, a dose-dependent 
increase in the cAMP accumulation was not observed in the case of this mutant as 
compared with WT.
CONCLUSION: OHSS and primary amenorrhea observed in the two affected women, 
respectively, could be attributed to the functional characteristics of 
respective mutant FSHR.
