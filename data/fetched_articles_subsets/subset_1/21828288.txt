OBJECTIVE: Circadian and stress-response systems mediate environmental changes 
that affect alcohol drinking. Psychosocial stress is an environmental risk 
factor for alcohol abuse. Circadian rhythm gene period 1 (Per1) is targeted by 
stress hormones and is transcriptionally activated in corticotropin releasing 
factor-expressing cells. The authors hypothesized that Per1 is involved in 
integrating stress response and circadian rhythmicity and explored its relevance 
to alcohol drinking.
METHOD: In mice, the effects of stress on ethanol intake in mPer1-mutant and 
wild-type mice were assessed. In humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
in hPer1 were tested for association with alcohol drinking behavior in 273 
adolescents and an adult case-control sample of 1,006 alcohol-dependent patients 
and 1,178 comparison subjects. In vitro experiments were conducted to measure 
genotype-specific expression and transcription factor binding to hPer1.
RESULTS: The mPer1-mutant mice showed enhanced alcohol consumption in response 
to social defeat stress relative to their wild-type littermates. An association 
with the frequency of heavy drinking in adolescents with the hPer1 promoter SNP 
rs3027172 and with psychosocial adversity was found. There was significant 
interaction between the rs3027172 genotype and psychosocial adversity on this 
drinking measure. In a confirmatory analysis, association of hPer1 rs3027172 
with alcohol dependence was shown. Cortisol-induced transcriptional activation 
of hPer1 was reduced in human B-lymphoblastoid cells carrying the risk genotype 
of rs3027172. Binding affinity of the transcription factor Snail1 to the risk 
allele of the hPer1 SNP rs3027172 was also reduced.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the hPer1 gene regulates alcohol 
drinking behavior during stressful conditions and provide evidence for 
underlying neurobiological mechanisms.
