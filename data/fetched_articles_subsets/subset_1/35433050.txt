Skin cancer has developed as one of the most common types of cancer in the 
world, with a significant impact on public health impact and the economy. 
Nanotechnology methods for cancer treatment are appealing since they allow for 
the effective transport of medicines and other biologically active substances to 
specific tissues while minimizing harmful consequences. It is one of the most 
significant fields of research for treating skin cancer. Various nanomaterials 
have been employed in skin cancer therapy. The current review will summarize 
numerous methods of treating and diagnosing skin cancer in the earliest stages. 
There are numerous skin cancer indicators available for the prompt diagnosis of 
this type of disease. Traditional approaches to skin cancer diagnosis are 
explored, as are their shortcomings. Electrochemical and optical biosensors for 
skin cancer diagnosis and management were also discussed. Finally, various 
difficulties concerning the cost and ease of use of innovative methods should be 
addressed and overcome.
