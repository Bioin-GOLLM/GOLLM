BACKGROUND: Methionine, an essential amino acid, is required for protein 
synthesis and normal cell metabolism. The transmethylation pathway and 
methionine salvage pathway (MTA cycle) are two major pathways regulating 
methionine metabolism. Recently, methionine has been reported to play a key role 
in Drosophila fecundity.
RESULTS: Here, we revealed that the MTA cycle plays a crucial role in Drosophila 
fecundity using the mutant of aci-reductone dioxygenase 1 (DADI1), an enzyme in 
the MTA cycle. In dietary restriction condition, the egg production of adi1 
mutant flies was reduced compared to that of control flies. This fecundity 
defect in mutant flies was rescued by reintroduction of Dadi1 gene. Moreover, a 
functional homolog of human ADI1 also recovered the reproduction defect, in 
which the enzymatic activity of human ADI1 is required for normal fecundity. 
Importantly, methionine supply rescued the fecundity defect in Dadi1 mutant 
flies. The detailed analysis of Dadi1 mutant ovaries revealed a dramatic change 
in the levels of methionine metabolism. In addition, we found that three 
compounds namely, methionine, SAM and Methionine sulfoxide, respectively, may be 
required for normal fecundity.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, these results suggest that ADI1, an MTA cycle enzyme, 
affects fly fecundity through the regulation of methionine metabolism.
