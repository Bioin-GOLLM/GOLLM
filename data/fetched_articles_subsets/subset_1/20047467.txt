Tumor transplant studies are important tools for studying cancer biology in a 
model organism. Transplantation is especially important for assaying tumor cell 
malignancy and migration capabilities, and is critical for identifying putative 
cancer stem cell populations. In this review, we discuss the current state of 
tumor transplantation studies performed in the zebrafish. We address several 
zebrafish-specific considerations for development of the transplant assay, 
including choosing recipient animals, transplant methods, and post-transplant 
observation. We also examine how the zebrafish is an advantageous model for 
transplantation, particularly with development of the translucent fish. 
Transplantation has already been critical for characterizing zebrafish models of 
leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, and melanoma. With further development of imaging 
techniques and other tools, zebrafish tumor transplantation will continue to 
contribute to our understanding of tumor cell biology.
