Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients who initially received tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy often acquired resistance via multiple complex 
mechanisms. The amplification of FGF3/4/19/CCND1 on chromosome 11q13 was found 
in many cancers with TKI resistance. However, the role of these amplifications 
in TKI-resistant NSCLC remains uncovered. Here, we generated the FGF3/4/19/CCND1 
amplification model in the NSCLC cell lines PC-9 and HCC827. Upregulation of 
FGF3/4/19/CCND1 strongly promoted cell proliferation and gefitinib resistance in 
NSCLC cells. To find out the potential therapeutic strategies, we screened the 
combination of inhibitors against the FGF/FGFR signaling pathway and the 
CCND1/CDK4 complex and revealed that gefitinib combined with LY2874455 and 
abemaciclib exhibited the most effective inhibition of resistance in vitro and 
in vivo. Mechanistically, FGFs/CCND1 activated the MAPK pathway, which was 
abolished by the combination drugs. Our study provides a rationale for clinical 
testing of dual targeting FGFR and CCND1 with LY2874455 and abemaciclib in NSCLC 
patients who harbored FGF3/4/19/CCND1 amplification.
