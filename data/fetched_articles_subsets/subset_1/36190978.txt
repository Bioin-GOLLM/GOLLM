CONTEXT: Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is caused by a rare 
pathogenic variant in the LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 genes. However, the causative 
variants in these genes have not been identified in approximately 40% of HeFH 
patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify novel (or additional) genes/variants that 
contribute to HeFH.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 215 family members from 122 
families with HeFH without pathogenic variants in the LDLR or PCSK9 genes.
RESULTS: We could not find novel causative familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) 
genes/variants by family analysis. Next, we examined all APOB variants. 
Twenty-four nonsynonymous APOB variants were identified. The allele frequencies 
of the c.2863C > T:p.(Pro955Ser) variant in the HeFH probands and the general 
Japanese population were 0.15 and 0.034, respectively [odds ratio 4.9 (95% CI 
3.4-7.1); P = 6.9 × 10-13]. The patients harboring the c.2863C > T:p.(Pro955Ser) 
variant accounted for 9.8% (n = 63) of unrelated patients with HeFH (n = 645). 
The penetrance of the c.2863C > T:p.(Pro955Ser) variant was low in the 
pedigree-based genetic analysis. In an in vitro assay, low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) uptake from patients with the homozygous c.2863C > T:p.(Pro955Ser) variant 
was 44% of the LDL uptake from control subjects, and it was similar to that of 
the LDL uptake from patients with the known pathogenic heterozygous 
p.(Arg3527Gln) variant.
CONCLUSIONS: The low-frequency APOB c.2863C > T:p.(Pro955Ser) variant is not an 
FH-causative variant, but it has a moderate effect size in HeFH. These findings 
suggest that the combination of the APOB c.2863C > T:p.(Pro955Ser) variant and 
age, environmental factors, or other genetic factors contributes to the severity 
of or variability in the HeFH phenotype.
