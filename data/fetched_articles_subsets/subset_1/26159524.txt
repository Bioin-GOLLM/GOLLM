A novel porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strain with 
393 nucleotide deletions in the nonstructural protein 2 (Nsp2) region was 
examined in this study. Results will help improve our understanding of the 
epidemiology and genetic diversity of the North American-type PRRSV in China.
