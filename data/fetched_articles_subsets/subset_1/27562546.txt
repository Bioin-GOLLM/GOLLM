BACKGROUND: Two-stage revision (TSR) knee arthroplasty is an established 
treatment, but failure to control infection still occurs in 4-50 % of cases. The 
aim of this study was to assess the infection eradication rate, risk factors for 
failure, and the clinical outcome after two-stage revision knee arthroplasty.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 59 patients who had undergone at 
least one two-stage revision procedure due to periprosthetic joint infection 
(PJI). Demographic data, comorbidities, types of implant, and complications were 
analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to 
identify risk factors for failure.
RESULTS: The infections were controlled in 55 patients (93.2 %). The follow-up 
period was 4.1 (±2.7) years. Infection control was achieved after the first TSR 
in 42 patients (71.2 %) and after the second TSR in 13 (76.5 %). The percentage 
of arthrodesis procedures in patients with infection control increased from 
16.75 % after one TSR to 69.2 % after two TSRs. Multivariate logistic regression 
analysis identified body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio 1.22; 95 % confidence 
intervals, 1.07 to 1.40; p = 0.004) and smoking (OR 21.52; 95 % CI, 2.60 to 
178.19; p = 0.004) as risk factors for failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage revision protocols can achieve acceptable results even 
after a second procedure. It is still unclear whether the choice of implant 
influences failure rates. Risk factors for failure after two-stage revision were 
identified. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed in order to support 
these findings and identify further risk factors. To reduce failure rates, 
programs should be established to treat or minimize risk factors in patients 
with PJI.
