BACKGROUND: Congenital cataracts are the most common cause of visual impairment 
worldwide. Inherited cataract is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous 
disease. Here we report disease-causing variants in a novel gene, CYP21A2, 
causing autosomal dominant posterior polar cataract. Variants in this gene are 
known to cause autosomal recessive congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
METHODS: Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we have identified disease-causing 
sequence variants in two families of British and Irish origin, and in two 
isolated cases of Asian-Indian and British origin. Bioinformatics analysis 
confirmed these variants as rare with damaging pathogenicity scores. Segregation 
was tested within the families using direct Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: A nonsense variant NM_000500.9 c.955 C > T; p.Q319* was identified in 
CYP21A2 in two families with posterior polar cataract and in an isolated case 
with unspecified congenital cataract phenotype. This is the same variant 
previously linked to CAH and identified as Q318* in the literature. We have also 
identified a rare missense variant NM_000500.9 c.770 T > C; p.M257T in an 
isolated case with unspecified congenital cataract phenotype.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of separate sequence variants in CYP21A2 
associated with congenital cataract. Our findings extend the genetic basis for 
congenital cataract and add to the phenotypic spectrum of CYP21A2 variants and 
particularly the CAH associated Q318* variant. CYP21A2 has a significant role in 
mineralo- and gluco-corticoid biosynthesis. These findings suggest that CYP21A2 
may be important for extra-adrenal biosynthesis of aldosterone and cortisol in 
the eye lens.
