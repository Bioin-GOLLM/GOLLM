Exome sequencing identifies CCDC8 mutations in 3-M syndrome, suggesting that 
CCDC8 contributes in a pathway with CUL7 and OBSL1 to control human growth.

3-M syndrome, a primordial growth disorder, is associated with mutations in CUL7 
and OBSL1. Exome sequencing now identifies mutations in CCDC8 as a cause of 3-M 
syndrome. CCDC8 is a widely expressed gene that is transcriptionally associated 
to CUL7 and OBSL1, and coimmunoprecipitation indicates a physical interaction 
between CCDC8 and OBSL1 but not CUL7. We propose that CUL7, OBSL1, and CCDC8 are 
members of a pathway controlling mammalian growth.
