Imitation SWI (ISWI) and other ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors play 
key roles in transcription and other processes by altering the structure and 
positioning of nucleosomes. Recent studies have also implicated ISWI in the 
regulation of higher-order chromatin structure, but its role in this process 
remains poorly understood. To clarify the role of ISWI in vivo, we examined 
defects in chromosome structure and gene expression resulting from the loss of 
Iswi function in Drosophila. Consistent with a broad role in transcriptional 
regulation, the expression of a large number of genes is altered in Iswi mutant 
larvae. The expression of a dominant-negative form of ISWI leads to dramatic 
alterations in higher-order chromatin structure, including the apparent 
decondensation of both mitotic and polytene chromosomes. The loss of ISWI 
function does not cause obvious defects in nucleosome assembly, but results in a 
significant reduction in the level of histone H1 associated with chromatin in 
vivo. These findings suggest that ISWI plays a global role in chromatin 
compaction in vivo by promoting the association of the linker histone H1 with 
chromatin.
