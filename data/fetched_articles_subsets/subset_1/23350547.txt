Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by over-accumulation of low-density lipoprotein-derived 
cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/L) throughout 
the body. Human mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 genes have been directly 
associated with impaired cholesterol efflux from LE/L. Independent from its role 
in cholesterol homeostasis and its NPC2 partner, NPC1 was unexpectedly 
identified as a critical player controlling intracellular entry of filoviruses 
such as Ebola. In this study, a yeast three-hybrid system revealed that the NPC1 
cytoplasmic tail directly interacts with the clathrin adaptor protein AP-1 via 
its acidic/di-leucine motif. Consequently, a nonfunctional AP-1A cytosolic 
complex resulted in a typical NPC-like phenotype mainly due to a direct 
impairment of NPC1 trafficking to LE/L and a partial secretion of NPC2. 
Furthermore, the mislocalization of NPC1 was not due to cholesterol accumulation 
in LE/L, as it was not rescued upon treatment with Mβ-cyclodextrin, which almost 
completely eliminated intracellular free cholesterol. Our cumulative data 
demonstrate that the cytosolic clathrin adaptor AP-1A is essential for the 
lysosomal targeting and function of NPC1 and NPC2.
