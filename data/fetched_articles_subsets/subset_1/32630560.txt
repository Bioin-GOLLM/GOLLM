The evidence that pan-Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL-specific inhibitors prematurely kill 
virus-infected or RNA/DNA-transfected cells provides rationale for investigating 
these apoptotic inducers further. We hypothesized that not only invasive RNA or 
DNA (biological factors) but also DNA/RNA-damaging chemical or physical factors 
could trigger apoptosis that have been sensitized with pan-Bcl-2 or 
Bcl-xL-specific agents; Methods: We tested chemical and physical factors plus 
Bcl-xL-specific inhibitor A-1155463 in cells of various origins and the small 
roundworms (C. elegans); Results: We show that combination of a A-1155463 along 
with a DNA-damaging agent, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), prematurely kills 
cells of various origins as well as C. elegans. The synergistic effect is 
p53-dependent and associated with the release of Bad and Bax from Bcl-xL, which 
trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, we found 
that combining Bcl-xL-specific inhibitors with various chemical compounds or 
physical insults also induced cell death; Conclusions: Thus, we were able to 
identify several biological, chemical and physical triggers of the 
evolutionarily conserved Bcl-xL-mediated apoptotic pathway, shedding light on 
strategies and targets for novel drug development.
