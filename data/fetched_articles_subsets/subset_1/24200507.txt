BACKGROUND: Two-photon microscopy is widely used to study brain function, but 
conventional microscopes are too slow to capture the timing of neuronal 
signalling and imaging is restricted to one plane. Recent development of 
acousto-optic-deflector-based random access functional imaging has improved the 
temporal resolution, but the utility of these technologies for mapping 3D 
synaptic activity patterns and their performance at the excitation wavelengths 
required to image genetically encoded indicators have not been investigated.
NEW METHOD: Here, we have used a compact acousto-optic lens (AOL) two-photon 
microscope to make high speed [Ca(2+)] measurements from spines and dendrites 
distributed in 3D with different excitation wavelengths (800-920 nm).
RESULTS: We show simultaneous monitoring of activity from many synaptic inputs 
distributed over the 3D arborisation of a neuronal dendrite using both synthetic 
as well as genetically encoded indicators. We confirm the utility of AOL-based 
imaging for fast in vivo recordings by measuring, simultaneously, visually 
evoked responses in 100 neurons distributed over a 150 μm focal depth range. 
Moreover, we explore ways to improve the measurement of timing of neuronal 
activation by choosing specific regions within the cell soma.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: These results establish that AOL-based 3D 
random access two-photon microscopy has a wider range of neuroscience 
applications than previously shown.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the compact AOL microscope design has the 
speed, spatial resolution, sensitivity and wavelength flexibility to measure 3D 
patterns of synaptic and neuronal activity on individual trials.
