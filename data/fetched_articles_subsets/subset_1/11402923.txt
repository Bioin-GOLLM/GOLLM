BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor isoform 
gamma (PPAR gamma) is a key regulator in lipid and glucose homoeostasis. A 
common polymorphism (Pro12Ala in PPAR gamma 2, prevalence ca. 25%) was shown to 
be associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Generally, both 
beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance contribute to the development of 
type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the 
mechanism by which the Ala allele of this polymorphism contributes to the 
reduced risk for type 2 diabetes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 51 subjects without (Pro/Pro) and 26 subjects 
with this polymorphisms (X/Ala) (both groups non-diabetic) by a modified 
hyperglycaemic clamp which permitted determination of both insulin secretion (in 
response to glucose, GLP-1 and arginine) and insulin sensitivity.
RESULTS: None of the various phases of insulin secretion was significantly 
different between the 2 genotype groups (all p values > 0.13). In contrast, 
insulin sensitivity was significantly greater in X/Ala (0.19 +/- 0.03 U) 
compared to Pro/Pro (0.14 +/- 0.01 U, p = 0.04). In a two-dimensional assessment 
of insulin sensitivity and secretion, the homozygous alanine carriers appeared 
to have the most favourable constellation.
CONCLUSION: These simultaneously obtained data for insulin secretion and 
sensitivity strongly suggest that the mechanism by which the Ala allele 
contributes to a risk reduction for type 2 diabetes most likely involves an 
increase in insulin sensitivity.
