Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are a powerful model to study early mouse 
development. These blastocyst-derived cells can maintain pluripotency and 
differentiate into the three embryonic germ layers and an extraembryonic layer, 
the extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn), which shares similar molecular markers to 
the definitive endoderm. Here, we present a fast procedure to identify a 
differentiation defect of mESCs toward ExEn in vitro through the molecular and 
cellular characterization of embryoid bodies, followed by direct differentiation 
of mESCs into ExEn. For complete details on the use and execution of this 
protocol, please refer to Ngondo et al. (2018).
