Alternative oxidase (AOX) is a nonproton motive quinol-oxygen oxidoreductase 
which is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in higher plants. In 
this study, we have characterized the catalytic activity and regulatory 
behaviors of Arum concinnatum AOX isoforms, namely AcoAOX1a and AcoAOX1b, and 
their artificial mutants in HeLa cells. We demonstrated that substitution of the 
motif-like sequence ENV on the C-terminal half of AcoAOX1a for QDT diminishes 
its activity and proposed that the innate inactivity of AcoAOX1b in HeLa cells 
is, at least in part, attributable to its QDT motif. Furthermore, we show that 
introduction of F130L in the hydrophilic N-terminal extension of AcoAOX1a 
resulted in greater activity in the presence of pyruvate. This result indicates 
that functional significance of the N-terminal extension is not particular to 
the conventional regulatory cysteine. On the basis of these findings, we discuss 
new insights into the structural integrity of AOX in HeLa cells and the 
applicability of mammalian cells for functional analysis of this enzyme.
