How neural circuits drive behavior is a central question in neuroscience. Proper 
execution of motor behavior requires precise coordination of many neurons. 
Within a motor circuit, individual neurons tend to play discrete roles by 
promoting or suppressing motor output. How exactly neurons function in specific 
roles to fine tune motor output is not well understood. In C. elegans, the 
interneuron RIM plays important yet complex roles in locomotion behavior. Here, 
we show that RIM both promotes and suppresses distinct features of locomotion 
behavior to fine tune motor output. This dual function is achieved via the 
excitation and inhibition of the same motor circuit by electrical and chemical 
neurotransmission, respectively. Additionally, this bi-directional regulation 
contributes to motor adaptation in animals placed in novel environments. Our 
findings reveal that individual neurons within a neural circuit may act in 
opposing ways to regulate circuit dynamics to fine tune behavioral output.
