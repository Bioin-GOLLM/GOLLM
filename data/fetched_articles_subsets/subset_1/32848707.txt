The importance of early interventions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) emphasizes the 
need to accurately and efficiently identify at-risk individuals. Although many 
dementia prediction models have been developed, there are fewer studies focusing 
on detection of brain pathology. We developed a model for identification of 
amyloid-PET positivity using data on demographics, vascular factors, cognition, 
APOE genotype, and structural MRI, including regional brain volumes, cortical 
thickness and a visual medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) rating. We also 
analyzed the relative importance of different factors when added to the overall 
model. The model used baseline data from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention 
Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) exploratory PET 
sub-study. Participants were at risk for dementia, but without dementia or 
cognitive impairment. Their mean age was 71 years. Participants underwent a 
brain 3T MRI and PiB-PET imaging. PiB images were visually determined as 
positive or negative. Cognition was measured using a modified version of the 
Neuropsychological Test Battery. Body mass index (BMI) and hypertension were 
used as cardiovascular risk factors in the model. Demographic factors included 
age, gender and years of education. The model was built using the Disease State 
Index (DSI) machine learning algorithm. Of the 48 participants, 20 (42%) were 
rated as Aβ positive. Compared with the Aβ negative group, the Aβ positive group 
had a higher proportion of APOE ε4 carriers (53 vs. 14%), lower executive 
functioning, lower brain volumes, and higher visual MTA rating. AUC [95% CI] for 
the complete model was 0.78 [0.65-0.91]. MRI was the most effective factor, 
especially brain volumes and visual MTA rating but not cortical thickness. APOE 
was nearly as effective as MRI in improving detection of amyloid positivity. The 
model with the best performance (AUC 0.82 [0.71-0.93]) was achieved by combining 
APOE and MRI. Our findings suggest that combining demographic data, vascular 
risk factors, cognitive performance, APOE genotype, and brain MRI measures can 
help identify Aβ positivity. Detecting amyloid positivity could reduce invasive 
and costly assessments during the screening process in clinical trials.
