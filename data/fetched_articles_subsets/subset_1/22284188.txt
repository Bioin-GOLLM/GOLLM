Plasticity of excitatory synapses onto striatal projection neurons (MSNs) has 
the potential to regulate motor function by setting the gain on signals driving 
both direct- and indirect-pathway basal ganglia circuits. 
Endocannabinoid-dependent long-term depression (eCB-LTD) is the best 
characterized form of striatal plasticity, but the mechanisms governing its 
normal regulation and pathological dysregulation are not well understood. We 
characterized two distinct signaling pathways mediating eCB production in 
striatal indirect-pathway MSNs and found that both pathways were modulated by 
dopamine D2 and adenosine A2A receptors, acting through cAMP/PKA. We identified 
regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) as a key link between D2/A2A signaling 
and eCB mobilization pathways. In contrast to wild-type mice, RGS4⁻/⁻ mice 
exhibited normal eCB-LTD after dopamine depletion and were significantly less 
impaired in the 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease. Taken together, these 
results suggest that inhibition of RGS4 may be an effective nondopaminergic 
strategy for treating Parkinson's disease.
