Sheldon-Hall syndrome (SHS) is the most common of the distal arthrogryposes 
(DAs), a group of disorders characterized by congenital non-progressive 
contractures. Patients with SHS present with contractures of the limbs and a 
distinctive triangular facies with prominent nasolabial folds. Calcaneovalgus 
deformity is frequent, as well as camptodactyly and ulnar deviation. Causative 
mutations in at least four different genes have been reported (MYH3, TNNI2, 
TPM2, and TNNT3). MYH3 plays a pivotal role in fetal muscle development and 
mutations in this gene are associated with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, distal 
arthrogryposis 8 (DA8), and autosomal dominant spondylocarpotarsal synostosis. 
The last two disorders are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, in 
particular bony fusions. The observation that MYH3 may be mutated in these 
syndromes has suggested the involvement of this gene in bone development. We 
report the case of a boy with a novel pathogenic MYH3 mutation, presenting with 
the classical clinical features of SHS in association with unilateral carpal 
bone fusion and multiple vertebral fusions. This distinctive phenotype has never 
been reported in the literature so far and expands the phenotypic spectrum of 
SHS, endorsing the clinical variability of patients with MYH3-related disorders. 
Our findings also support a role for MYH3 in both muscle and bone development, 
suggesting a phenotypic continuum in MYH3-related disorders.
