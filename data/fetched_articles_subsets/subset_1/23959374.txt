PURPOSE: Repression of Runt-related transcription factor 3 (Runx3) gene, a tumor 
suppressor, has been known to be involved in Helicobacter pylori (H. 
pylori)-associated gastric carcinogenesis and cancer development. The present 
study was undertaken to study the Runx3 intronic T/A polymorphism (rs760805) in 
H. pylori-infected patients and uninfected controls of Tamil Nadu region, South 
India. Also, Runx3 gene expression, HK alpha (H,K-ATPase) gene expression and 
the methylation status of the Runx3 CpG island was determined.
METHODS: In a prospective study, tissue biopsies were collected from 40 H. 
pylori-infected patients and 40 infection negative controls. Single nucleotide 
polymorphism analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-single-strand conformational polymorphism, and DNA sequencing. Gene 
expression analysis of Runx3 and HK alpha was carried out using semiquantitative 
reverse transcriptase-PCR. Methylation analysis of Runx3 CpG island was 
undertaken using methylationspecific restriction digestion-PCR.
RESULTS: The homozygous TT genotype was found to be the predominant genotype in 
positive samples and negative controls. No significant variation in gene 
expression was observed in positive samples and controls with respect to Runx3 
and Hk alpha genes. Methylation analysis suggested that there was a lack of 
methylation except in a few subjects studied.
CONCLUSION: The present study, first from this region, could neither detect 
significant repression of the Runx3 and HK alpha genes nor methylation in 
positive patients studied suggesting a lack of involvement of this tumor 
suppressor as a risk factor in the H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis 
in the South Indian population studied.
