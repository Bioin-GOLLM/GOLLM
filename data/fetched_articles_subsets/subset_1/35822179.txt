Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present in many types of tumors and 
play a pivotal role in tumor progression and immunosuppression. 
Fibroblast-activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed on CAFs, has been 
indicated as a universal tumor target. However, FAP expression is not restricted 
to tumors, and systemic treatment against FAP often causes severe side effects. 
To solve this problem, a photodynamic therapy (PDT) approach was developed based 
on ZnF16Pc (a photosensitizer)-loaded and FAP-specific single chain variable 
fragment (scFv)-conjugated apoferritin nanoparticles, or αFAP-Z@FRT. αFAP-Z@FRT 
PDT efficiently eradicates CAFs in tumors without inducing systemic toxicity. 
When tested in murine 4T1 models, the PDT treatment elicits anti-cancer 
immunity, causing suppression of both primary and distant tumors, i.e. abscopal 
effect. Treatment efficacy is enhanced when αFAP-Z@FRT PDT is used in 
combination with anti-PD1 antibodies. Interestingly, it is found that the PDT 
treatment not only elicits a cellular immunity against cancer cells, but also 
stimulates an anti-CAFs immunity. This is supported by an adoptive cell transfer 
study, where T cells taken from 4T1-tumor-bearing animals treated with αFAP PDT 
retard the growth of A549 tumors established on nude mice. Overall, our approach 
is unique for permitting site-specific eradication of CAFs and inducing a broad 
spectrum anti-cancer immunity.
