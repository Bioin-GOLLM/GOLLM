Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer type among women in the world. There 
is abundant evidence, that alterations in the breast cancer susceptibility 
genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are present in a large proportion of families with 
multiple cases of breast and ovarian cancer. Our aim was to better understand 
the molecular and structural insights associated with the most frequent 
alterations, found in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, within our patients. We 
analyzed 50 breast cancer cases. Of those, 24% were found to carry deleterious 
mutations, and up to 10 rare variants of unknown significance were detected. The 
frequency of polymorphic changes was considerably different between genes, BRCA1 
(55%) and BRCA2 (19.4%). By looking at the protein level, the changes observed 
within the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes could affect not only the nucleic location of 
the protein but also disrupt the folding and, therefore, the tumor suppressor 
function.
