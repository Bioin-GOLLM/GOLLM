Vocal communication is negatively affected by neurodegenerative diseases, such 
as Parkinson disease, and by aging. The neurological and sensorimotor mechanisms 
underlying voice deficits in Parkinson disease and aging are not 
well-understood. Rat ultrasonic vocalizations provide a unique behavioral model 
for studying communication deficits and the mechanisms underlying these deficits 
in these conditions. The purpose of this review was to examine the existing 
literature for methods using rat ultrasonic vocalization with regard to the 
primary disease pathology of Parkinson disease, dopamine denervation, and aging. 
Although only a small amount of papers were found for each of these topics, 
results suggest that both shared and unique acoustic deficits in ultrasonic 
vocalizations exist across conditions and that these acoustic deficits are due 
to changes in either dopamine signaling or denervation and in aging models 
changes to the nucleus ambiguus, at the level of the neuromuscular junction, and 
the composition of the vocal folds in the larynx. We conclude that ultrasonic 
vocalizations are a useful tool for studying biologic mechanisms underlying 
vocal communication deficits in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.
