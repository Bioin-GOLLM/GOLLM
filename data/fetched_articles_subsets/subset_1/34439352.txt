Current systemic treatment options for patients with adrenocortical carcinomas 
(ACCs) are far from being satisfactory. DNA damage/repair mechanisms, which 
involve, e.g., ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and 
ataxia-telangiectasia/Rad3-related (ATR) protein signaling or ribonucleotide 
reductase subunits M1/M2 (RRM1/RRM2)-encoded ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 
activation, commonly contribute to drug resistance. Moreover, the regulation of 
RRM2b, the p53-induced alternative to RRM2, is of unclear importance for ACC. 
Upon extensive drug screening, including a large panel of chemotherapies and 
molecular targeted inhibitors, we provide strong evidence for the anti-tumoral 
efficacy of combined gemcitabine (G) and cisplatin (C) treatment against the 
adrenocortical cell lines NCI-H295R and MUC-1. However, accompanying induction 
of RRM1, RRM2, and RRM2b expression also indicated developing G resistance, a 
frequent side effect in clinical patient care. Interestingly, this effect was 
partially reversed upon addition of C. We confirmed our findings for RRM2 
protein, RNR-dependent dATP levels, and modulations of related ATM/ATR 
signaling. Finally, we screened for complementing inhibitors of the DNA 
damage/repair system targeting RNR, Wee1, CHK1/2, ATR, and ATM. Notably, the 
combination of G, C, and the dual RRM1/RRM2 inhibitor COH29 resulted in 
previously unreached total cell killing. In summary, we provide evidence that 
RNR-modulating therapies might represent a new therapeutic option for ACC.
