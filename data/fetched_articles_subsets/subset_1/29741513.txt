Myelofibrosis is one of the BCR-ABL-negative clonal disorders that collectively 
are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). It is caused by the 
proliferation of clonal hematopoietic stem cells, which over time leads to 
characteristic clinical features. The disease presentation is heterogeneous, 
however, with 30% of patients initially asymptomatic. This variation in clinical 
phenotype warrants careful risk stratification to guide appropriate management, 
and prognostic risk scores are continually being refined. Considerable 
advancements have been made in the understanding of MPN pathogenesis, in 
particular recognition of the driver mutations JAK2 V617F, CALR, and MPL, which 
has led to the development of ruxolitinib, an inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) 
and JAK2 that has transformed therapy for myelofibrosis. Although ruxolitinib 
decreases symptoms and is associated with a survival advantage, it has no clear 
disease-altering activity, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
remains the sole curative option for myelofibrosis. Ongoing studies are 
evaluating newer JAK inhibitors, combinations of ruxolitinib with other targeted 
drugs, and targeted therapies that do not inhibit JAK. This review provides 
further detail regarding the clinical features, pathogenesis, risk 
stratification, and current management of myelofibrosis, including older and 
newer targeted treatments.
