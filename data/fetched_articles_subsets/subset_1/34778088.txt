The therapeutic landscape for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has improved 
significantly with the approval of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for 
therapeutic use. Most patients with optimal responses to TKIs can have a normal 
life expectancy. Treatment-free remission (TFR) after discontinuing TKI has 
increasingly become a new goal for CML treatment. However, TKI only "control" 
CML, and relapse after discontinuation has become a key factor hindering patient 
access to attempt TFR. In this study, we reviewed studies on TKI 
discontinuation, including both first and second-generation TKI. We also 
reviewed predictors of relapse, new monitoring methods, and strategies targeting 
leukemic stem cells.
