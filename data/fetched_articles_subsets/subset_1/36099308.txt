Liver-related diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), are significant causes of mortality globally. Specific causes and 
predictors of liver-related mortality in low resource settings require 
assessment to help inform clinical decision making and develop strategies for 
improved survival. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion 
of liver-related deaths associated with liver cirrhosis, HCC, and their known 
risk factors, and secondly to determine predictors of in-hospital mortality 
among cirrhosis and HCC patients in Ghana. We first performed a cross-sectional 
review of death register entries from 11 referral hospitals in Ghana to 
determine the proportion of liver-related deaths and the proportion of risk 
factors associated with these deaths. Secondly, we conducted a retrospective 
cohort review of 172 in-patient liver cirrhosis and HCC cases admitted to a 
tertiary referral centre and determined predictors of in-hospital mortality 
using binary logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In total, 
8.8% of deaths in Ghanaian adults were due to liver-related causes. The 
proportion of liver-related deaths attributed to HBV infection was 48.8% (95% 
CI: 45.95-51.76), HCV infection was 7.0% (95% CI: 5.58-8.45), HBV-HCV 
co-infection 0.5% (95% CI: 0.1-0.9) and alcohol was 10.0% (95% CI: 8.30-11.67). 
Of 172 cases of HCC and liver cirrhosis, the in-patient mortality rate was 
54.1%. Predictors of in-patient mortality in cirrhotic patients were increasing 
WBC (OR = 1.14 95% CI: 1.00-1.30) and the revised model for end-stage liver 
disease with sodium (MELD-Na) score (OR = 1.24 95% CI: 1.01-1.54). For HCC 
patients, female sex (OR = 3.74 95% CI: 1.09-12.81) and hepatic encephalopathy 
(grade 1) were associated with higher mortality (OR = 5.66 95% CI: 1.10-29.2). 
In conclusion, HBV is linked to a high proportion of HCC-related deaths in 
Ghana, with high in-hospital mortality rates that require targeted policies to 
improve survival.
