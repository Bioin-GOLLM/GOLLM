Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons replicate through a 
copy-and-paste mechanism using an RNA intermediate. However, little is known 
about the physical transmission of retrotransposon RNA between cells. To examine 
the horizontal transfer of an active human L1 retrotransposon mediated by 
extracellular vesicles (EVs), human cancer cells were transfected with an 
expression construct containing a retrotransposition-competent human L1 tagged 
with a reporter gene. Using this model, active retrotransposition events were 
detected by screening for the expression of the reporter gene inserted into the 
host genome by retrotransposition. EVs including exosomes and microvesicles were 
isolated from cells by differential centrifugation. The enrichment of L1-derived 
reporter RNA transcripts were detected in EVs isolated from cells expressing 
active L1 retrotransposition. The delivery of reporter RNA was confirmed in 
recipient cells, and reporter genes were detected in the genome of recipient 
cells. Additionally, employing qRT-PCR, we found that host-encoded factors are 
activated in response to increased exposure to L1-derived RNA transcripts in 
recipient cells. Our results suggest that the horizontal transfer of 
retrotransposons can occur through the incorporation of RNA intermediates 
delivered via EVs and may have important implications for the intercellular 
regulation of gene expression and gene function.
