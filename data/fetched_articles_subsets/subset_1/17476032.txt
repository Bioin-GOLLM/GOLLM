Increased plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels are frequently 
associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To test the hypothesis that LPL 
gene mutations contribute to the hypertriglyceridemia observed in members of 
T2DM pedigrees, we screened the LPL gene in 53 hypertriglyceridemic members of 
26 families. Four known and three novel mutations were identified. All three 
novel mutations, Lys312insC, Thr361insA, and double mutation Lys312insC + 
Asn291Ser, are clinically associated with hypertriglyceridemia. In vitro 
mutagenesis and expression studies confirm that these variants are associated 
with a significant reduction in LPL activity. The modeled structures displaying 
the Lys312insC and Thr361insA mutations showed loss of the activity-related 
C-terminal domain in the LPL protein. Another novel double mutation, Lys312insC 
+ Asn291Ser, resulted in the loss of the catalytic ability of LPL attributable 
to the complete loss of the C-terminal domain and alteration in the heparin 
association site. Thus, these novel mutations of the LPL gene contribute to the 
hypertriglyceridemia observed in members of type 2 diabetic pedigrees.
