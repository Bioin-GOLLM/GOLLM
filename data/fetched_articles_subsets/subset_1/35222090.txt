The cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channel (RyR2) is inserted into the 
membrane of intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) myocyte Ca2+ stores, where 
it releases the Ca2+ essential for contraction. Mutations in proteins involved 
in Ca2+ signaling can lead to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular 
tachycardia (CPVT). The most common cellular phenotype in CPVT is higher than 
normal cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations during diastole due to Ca2+ leak from the 
SR through mutant RyR2. Arrhythmias are triggered when the surface membrane 
sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) lowers cytoplasmic Ca2+ by importing 3 Na+ ions 
to extrude one Ca2+ ion. The Na+ influx leads to delayed after depolarizations 
(DADs) which trigger arrhythmia when reaching action potential threshold. 
Present therapies use drugs developed for different purposes that 
serendipitously reduce RyR2 Ca2+ leak, but can adversely effect systolic Ca2+ 
release and other target processes. Ideal drugs would specifically reverse the 
effect of individual mutations, without altering normal channel function. Such 
drugs will depend on the location of the mutation in the 4967-residue monomer 
and the effect of the mutation on local structure, and downstream effects on 
structures along the conformational pathway to the pore. Such atomic resolution 
information is only now becoming available. This perspective provides a summary 
of known or predicted structural changes associated with a handful of CPVT 
mutations. Known molecular changes associated with RyR opening are discussed, as 
well one study where minute molecular changes with a particular mutation have 
been tracked from the N-terminal mutation site to gating residues in the channel 
pore.
