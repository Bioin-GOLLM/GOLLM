Mutations in the pyrazinamidase (PZase) gene (pncA) are considered the major 
mechanism of pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The 
aim of this study was designed to determine pncA mutations among ten PZA 
resistant and two PZA susceptible M. tuberculosis strains from Turkey and also 
to compare the PZase activity of them with the genotype. All isolates were 
identified by BACTEC NAP (P-nitro-alpha-acetylamino-beta-hydroxy-propiophenone) 
test and PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction Fragment Length 
Polymorphism) method. Drug sensitivity tests were performed by BACTEC system. 
PncA mutations were detected by DNA sequence analysis. No mutation was detected 
in two PZA susceptible and three out of ten PZA resistant strains. While, two of 
the PZA resistant strains had mutations in the same region (Gly24Asp), two of 
the PZA resistant strains had mutations in different regions (Thr160Lys), 
(His51Pro). Three of the PZA resistant strains had frameshift as a 167 bp 
deletion at nucleotide position 102. As a result, we detected two new mutations 
and a frameshift which may be responsible for PZA resistance in this study 
different from the other studies which previously 51st codon mutation was 
reported.
