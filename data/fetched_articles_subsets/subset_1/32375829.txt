BACKGROUND: The prevalence of EGFR/ALK co-alterations in patients with NSCLC was 
low. The several previous studies focused on the simultaneous occurrence of EGFR 
mutations and ALK rearrangements in a unifocal lung cancer. However, the 
incidence of multifocal pulmonary adenocarcinomas was increasingly encountered 
in clinical practice, due to the increased availability and improvement of the 
thoracic imaging. The clinical relevance of EGFR/ALK co-alterations in 
multifocal adenocarcinomas required detailed investigation as well.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 57-year-old woman with solid nodule 
in the left upper lung and a ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe, who 
underwent radical operation. Pathological examination confirmed multifocal 
adenocarcinoma, molecular tests revealed that the left upper lung lesion was 
positive for ALK rearrangement but the left lower lobe displayed EGFR mutation 
positive separately. The patient pulmonary lesions were well controlled by 
adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When brain metastases occurred, 
EGFR-TKI was not effective after firstly administration, while subsequent ALK 
inhibitors were efficient. We retrospective evaluated the oncogenic status of 
metastatic lymph nodes and found that the driver gene was ALK rearrangement 
rather than EGFR mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: The status of the oncogenic mutations in lymph node metastasis may 
provide some effective hints for metastasis lesion in other organ or tissue. 
Therefore, it is recommended to fully evaluate the driver genes in lymph node 
metastasis after radical resection.
