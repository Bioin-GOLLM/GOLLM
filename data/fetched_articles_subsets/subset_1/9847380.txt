The Tax transactivator protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 
plays a central role in the activation of viral gene expression. In addition, 
Tax is capable of activating the expression of specific cellular genes and is 
involved in the transformation of T-lymphocytes resulting in the development of 
adult T-cell leukemia. Tax is a phosphoprotein that colocalizes in nuclear 
bodies with RNA polymerase II, splicing complexes, and specific transcription 
factors including members of the ATF/CREB and NF-kappaB families. In this study, 
we identified adjacent serine residues at positions 300 and 301 in the carboxy 
terminus of Tax as the major sites for phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of at 
least one of these serine residues is required for Tax localization in nuclear 
bodies and for Tax-mediated activation of gene expression via both the ATF/CREB 
and NF-kappaB pathways. Introduction of amino acid substitutions which are 
phosphoserine mimetics at positions 300 and 301 restored the ability of a 
phosphorylation-defective Tax mutant to form nuclear bodies and to activate gene 
expression. These studies define sites for regulatory phosphorylation events in 
Tax which are critical for its ability to activate gene transcription.
