Cardiac organoids are in vitro self-organizing and three-dimensional structures 
composed of multiple cardiac cells (i.e., cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, 
cardiac fibroblasts, etc.) with or without biological scaffolds. Since cardiac 
organoids recapitulate structural and functional characteristics of the native 
heart to a higher degree compared to the conventional two-dimensional culture 
systems, their applications, in combination with pluripotent stem cell 
technologies, are being widely expanded for the investigation of cardiogenesis, 
cardiac disease modeling, drug screening and development, and regenerative 
medicine. In this mini-review, recent advances in cardiac organoid technologies 
are summarized in chronological order, with a focus on the methodological points 
for each organoid formation. Further, the current limitations and the future 
perspectives in these promising systems are also discussed.
