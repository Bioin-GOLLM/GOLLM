With covalently closed circular structures, circular RNAs (circRNAs) were once 
misinterpreted as by-products of mRNA splicing. Being abundant, stable, highly 
conserved, and tissue-specific, circRNAs are recently identified as a type of 
regulatory RNAs. CircRNAs bind to certain miRNAs or proteins to participate in 
gene transcription and translation. Emerging evidence has indicated that the 
dysregulation of circRNAs is closely linked to the tumorigenesis and treatment 
response of hematological malignancies. CircRNAs play critical roles in various 
biological processes, including tumorigenesis, drug resistance, tumor 
metabolism, autophagy, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. The N6-methyladenosine 
modification of circRNAs and discovery of fusion-circRNAs provide novel insights 
into the functions of circRNAs. Targeting circRNAs in hematological malignancies 
will be an attractive treatment strategy. In this review, we systematically 
summarize recent advances toward the novel functions and molecular mechanisms of 
circRNAs in hematological malignancies, and highlight the potential clinical 
applications of circRNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for future 
exploration.
