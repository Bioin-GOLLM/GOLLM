We recently reported that homozygous Presenilin-1 (Psen1) knockin (KI) mice 
carrying the familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation L435F or C410Y 
recapitulate the phenotypes of Psen1(-/-) mice. Production and steady-state 
levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 are undetectable in KI/KI brains and reduced in KI/+ 
brains, though the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is slightly increased in KI/+ brains. 
Moreover, the FAD mutation impairs synaptic function, learning and memory, and 
age-dependent neuronal survival in the adult brain. Here we extend our analysis 
of the effects of the L435F and C410Y mutations to the generation of Aβ43. 
Similar to Aβ40 and Aβ42, production of Aβ43 is undetectable in KI/KI brains and 
reduced in KI/+ brains. These results support our previous conclusions that the 
L435F and C410Y mutations cause loss of Presenilin function and γ-secretase 
activity, including impaired Aβ production in the brain. This Matters Arising 
Response paper addresses the Veugelen et al. (2016) Matters Arising paper,
