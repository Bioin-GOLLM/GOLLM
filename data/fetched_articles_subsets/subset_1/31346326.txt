PURPOSE: Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala (CREKA) is a pentapeptide which can target 
fibrin-fibronectin complexes. Our previous study has built a probe called iCREKA 
which was based on CREKA and has proved the feasibility and specificity of 
iCREKA by the fluorescence experiment. The purpose of this study is to achieve 
the 18F-labeled iCREKA and make preclinical evaluation of the 18F-iCREKA with 
comparison of its contrasted linear peptide (LP).
METHODS: CREKA, LP, and iCREKA were labeled by the Al18F labeling method, 
respectively. These 18F-labeled peptides were evaluated by the radiochemistry, 
binding affinity, in vitro stability, in vivo stability, micro-PET imaging, and 
biodistribution tests.
RESULTS: 18F-NOTA-iCREKA was stable both in vitro and in vivo. However, 
18F-NOTA-CREKA and 18F-NOTA-LP were both unstable. The FITC or 18F-labeled 
iCREKA could be abundantly discovered only in matrix metalloproteinases- (MMPs-) 
2/9 highly expressed U87MG cells, while the FITC or 18F-labeled LP could also be 
abundantly discovered in MMP-2/9 lowly expressed Caov3 cells. Biodistribution 
and micropositron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed that the U87MG 
xenografts showed a higher uptake of 18F-NOTA-iCREKA than 18F-NOTA-LP while the 
Caov3 xenografts showed very low uptake of both 18F-NOTA-iCREKA and 18F-NOTA-LP. 
The tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratio of 18F-NOTA-iCREKA (9.93 ± 0.42) was obviously 
higher than 18F-NOTA-LP (2.69 ± 0.35) in U87MG xenografts.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel CREKA-based probe 18F-NOTA-iCREKA could get a high uptake 
in U87MG cells and high T/M ratio in U87MG mice. It was more stable and specific 
than the 18F-NOTA-LP.
