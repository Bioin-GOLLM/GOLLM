OBJECTIVE: JAK2 V617F, MPL W515L and JAK2 exon 12 mutations are novel acquired 
mutations that induce constitutive cytokine-independent activation of the 
JAK-STAT pathway in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). The discovery of these 
mutations provides novel mechanism for activation of signal transduction in 
hematopoietic malignancies. This research was to investigate their prevalence in 
Chinese patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
METHODS: We introduced allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) combined with sequence 
analysis to simultaneously screen JAK2 V617F, MPL W515L and JAK2 exon 12 
mutations in 30 patients with PMF.
RESULTS: Fifteen PMF patients (50.0%) carried JAK2 V617F mutation, and only two 
JAK2 V617F-negative patients (6.7%) harbored MPL W515L mutation. None had JAK2 
exon 12 mutations. Furthermore, these three mutations were not detected in 50 
healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: MPL W515L and JAK2 V617F mutations existed in PMF patients but JAK2 
exon 12 mutations not. JAK2 V617F and MPL W515L and mutations might contribute 
to the primary molecular pathogenesis in patients with PMF.
