Control of blood flow distribution and tissue homeostasis depend on the tight 
regulation of and coordination between the microvascular network and circulating 
blood cells. Channels formed by connexins or pannexins that connect the intra- 
and extracellular compartments allow the release of paracrine signals, such as 
ATP and prostaglandins, and thus play a central role in achieving fine 
regulation and coordination of vascular function. This review focuses on 
vascular connexin hemichannels and pannexin channels. We review their expression 
pattern within the arterial and venous system with a special emphasis on how 
post-translational modifications by phosphorylation and S-nitrosylation of these 
channels modulate their function and contribute to vascular homeostasis. 
Furthermore, we highlight the contribution of these channels in smooth muscle 
cells and endothelial cells in the regulation of vasomotor tone as well as how 
these channels in endothelial cells regulate inflammatory responses such as 
during ischemic and hypoxic conditions. In addition, this review will touch on 
recent evidence implicating a role for these proteins in regulating red blood 
cell and platelet function.
