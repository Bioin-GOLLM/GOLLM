PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW: This article provides an overview into acute treatments 
in stroke which are widely studied and available for adults and their 
applicability in the pediatric population.
RECENT FINDINGS: Arterial ischemic stroke is an important cause of morbidity and 
mortality in the pediatric population. Neurological deficits and etiologies are 
age-dependent and more challenging to diagnose than in the adult population. 
Advancements in imaging and treatment modalities including increased treatment 
windows in acute stroke have led to improvement in the diagnosis and management 
of pediatric arterial ischemic disease. Accordingly, hyperacute treatments, such 
as endovascular therapy, are becoming increasingly available in an attempt to 
improve outcomes in children.
SUMMARY: Significant scientific and technological advances have transformed the 
hyperacute treatment of stroke in the recent years, allowing for improvement in 
the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular pathologies in children. 
Optimization in the approach, and validation of existing stroke 
pathways/protocols is expected to further advance acute stroke therapy in 
pediatric patient care. Given that the lifelong individual, family, and societal 
burden of acute stroke is likely to be greater than in adults because infants 
and children surviving stroke live more years with disability, we must be 
knowledgeable about this pathology and the medical and therapeutic options 
available for this unique population as detailed in this review.
