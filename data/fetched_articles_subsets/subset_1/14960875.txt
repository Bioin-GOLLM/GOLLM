Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C) is an autosomal recessive 
disorder caused by mutations in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene. A 'private' Gypsy 
C283Y mutation was detected in this gene. Recently, a number of LGMD2C-affected 
families belonging to a Xoroxane Gypsy group have been detected in eastern 
Bulgaria and all of these cases were due to the same mutation. We have screened 
300 unrelated individuals of reproductive age from this high-risk Xoroxane Gypsy 
group, settled in Sliven. The genetic test by PCR-SSCP analysis for the C283Y 
mutation revealed a carrier frequency of 7.7%. The screened sample was 
ethnically not homogeneous. It was divided in ethnonym groups on the basis of 
social and economic status, language characteristics and trades. We found that 
the C283Y was not randomly distributed among the Gypsy subgroups. The disease 
seemed to be limited to the Xoroxane Gypsy group and geographically localized in 
eastern Bulgaria.
