Diverse guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) regulate the activity of GTP 
binding proteins. One of the most complicated pairs is eukaryotic initiation 
factor 2B (eIF2B) and eIF2, which function during protein synthesis initiation 
in eukaryotes. We have mutated conserved surface residues within the eIF2B GEF 
domain, located at the eIF2Bepsilon C terminus. Extensive genetic and 
biochemical characterization established how these residues contribute to GEF 
activity. We find that the universally conserved residue E569 is critical for 
activity and that even a conservative E569D substitution is lethal in vivo. 
Several mutations within residues close to E569 have no discernible effect on 
growth or GCN4 expression, but an alanine substitution at the adjacent L568 is 
cold sensitive and deregulates GCN4 activity at 15 degrees C. The mutation of 
W699, found on a separate surface approximately 40 A from E569, is also lethal. 
Binding studies show that W699 is critical for interaction with eIF2beta, while 
L568 and E569 are not. In contrast, all three residues are critical for 
interaction with eIF2gamma. These data show that multiple contacts between 
eIF2gamma and eIF2Bepsilon mediate nucleotide exchange.
