A series of PROTACs (PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras) consisting of bicalutamide 
analogs and thalidomides were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated 
as novel androgen receptor (AR) degraders. In particular, we found that PROTAC 
compound 13b could successfully demonstrate a targeted degradation of AR in 
AR-positive cancer cells and might be a useful chemical probe for the 
investigation of AR-dependent cancer cells, as well as a potential therapeutic 
candidate for prostate cancers.
