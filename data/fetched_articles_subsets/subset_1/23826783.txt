INTRODUCTION: Our previous study demonstrated marked regression of amyloid 
deposits in abdominal fat tissues of familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) 
patients treated with liver transplantation (LT). To determine whether similar 
changes in deposited amyloid can also occur in other organs, we examined gastric 
mucosal amyloid before and after LT in FAP patients with ATTRV30M.
METHODS: We histopathologically and biochemically investigated gastric mucosal 
amyloid before and after LT in six FAP patients with ATTRV30M.The amounts of 
amyloid deposits in biopsied gastric mucosa were determined by microscopy, and 
the proportion of wild-type transthyretin (TTR) in extracted amyloid fibril 
proteins was assayed by liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. 
Similar examinations were also performed in 21 untreated FAP patients and 13 
transplanted patients with ATTRV30M.
RESULTS: The amount of deposited amyloid was not markedly different before and 
after LT in six patients. However, the composition ratios of wild-type TTR in 
gastric mucosal amyloid increased markedly from 20.0% ± 11.4% before LT to 43.2% 
± 13.8% after LT. In addition, the ratio of wild-type TTR in all transplanted 
patients was significantly higher than that in untransplanted patients (72.7% ± 
25.5%, 23.8% ± 14.3%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the components of amyloid fibril proteins 
in gastric mucosa of transplanted FAP patients are different from those in 
untreated patients: a significant portion of preexisting ATTRV30M-derived 
amyloid seemed to be replaced by wild-type TTR-derived amyloid postoperatively, 
indicating that continuous turnover of amyloid deposits can occur in all organs 
in transplanted FAP patients. It was also confirmed that wild-type TTR plays an 
important role in the pathogenesis of postoperative amyloid deposition in 
transplanted FAP patients.
