Two HIV-infected individuals on second-line atazanavir-based antiretroviral 
therapy presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA 
was higher than plasma HIV RNA and antiretroviral regimens' optimization led to 
prompt resolution of symptoms in one. Patients on second-line atazanavir-based 
antiretroviral therapy with documented previous treatment failure may be at risk 
of symptomatic cerebrospinal fluid escape.
