Heightened aerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis are characteristic metabolic 
phenotypes in cancer cells. Neuroblastoma (NBL), a devastating pediatric cancer, 
is featured by frequent genomic amplification of MYCN, a member of the Myc 
oncogene family that is primarily expressed in the early stage of embryonic 
development and required for neural crest development. Here we report that an 
enriched glutaminolysis gene signature is associated with MYCN amplification in 
children with NBL. The partial knockdown of MYCN suppresses glutaminolysis in 
NBL cells. Conversely, forced overexpression of MYCN in neural crest progenitor 
cells enhances glutaminolysis. Importantly, glutaminolysis induces oxidative 
stress by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), rendering NBL cells sensitive 
to ROS augmentation. Through a small-scale metabolic-modulator screening, we 
have found that dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a Food and Drug Administration-approved 
drug for multiple sclerosis, suppresses NBL cell proliferation in vitro and 
tumor growth in vivo. DMF suppresses NBL cell proliferation through inducing ROS 
and subsequently suppressing MYCN expression, which is rescued by an ROS 
scavenger. Our findings suggest that the metabolic modulation and ROS 
augmentation could be used as novel strategies in treating NBL and other 
MYC-driven cancers.
