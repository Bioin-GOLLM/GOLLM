Ventricular trabeculation and compaction are two of the many essential steps for 
generating a functionally competent ventricular wall. A significant reduction in 
trabeculation is usually associated with ventricular compact zone deficiencies 
(hypoplastic wall), which commonly leads to embryonic heart failure and early 
embryonic lethality. In contrast, hypertrabeculation and lack of ventricular 
wall compaction (noncompaction) are closely related defects in cardiac 
embryogenesis associated with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), a 
genetically heterogenous disorder. Here we review recent findings through 
summarizing several genetically engineered mouse models that have defects in 
cardiac trabeculation and compaction.
