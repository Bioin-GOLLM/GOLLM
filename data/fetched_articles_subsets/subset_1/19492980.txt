Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the 
selective loss of both spinal and upper motor neurons. One strategy in treating 
ALS is to use stem cells to replace lost spinal motor neurons. However, 
transplanted stem cell-derived motor neurons may not survive when exposed to the 
harsh microenvironment in the spinal cord of ALS. In particular, dysfunctional 
astrocytes and overactivated microglia in ALS may limit the survival of motor 
neurons generated from cell replacement therapy. On the other hand, stem cells 
may provide large quantities of motor neurons that can be used for studying 
glia-mediated toxic mechanisms and potential therapies in ALS. Here we will 
review methods and molecular factors for directed differentiation of stem cells 
into spinal motor neurons, the potential uses of these models for dissecting the 
mechanisms underlying glia-induced motor neuron degeneration and screening for 
new therapeutics aimed at protecting motor neurons in ALS, as well as discuss 
challenges facing the development of motor neuron replacement-based cell 
therapies for recovery in ALS.
