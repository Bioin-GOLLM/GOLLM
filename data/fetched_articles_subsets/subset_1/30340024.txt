The highly intronic nature of protein coding genes in mammals necessitates a 
co-transcriptional splicing mechanism as revealed by mNET-seq analysis. 
Immunoprecipitation of MNase-digested chromatin with antibodies against RNA 
polymerase II (Pol II) shows that active spliceosomes (both snRNA and proteins) 
are complexed to Pol II S5P CTD during elongation and co-transcriptional 
splicing. Notably, elongating Pol II-spliceosome complexes form strong 
interactions with nascent transcripts, resulting in footprints of approximately 
60 nucleotides. Also, splicing intermediates formed by cleavage at the 5' splice 
site are associated with nearly all spliced exons. These spliceosome-bound 
intermediates are frequently ligated to upstream exons, implying a sequential, 
constitutive, and U12-dependent splicing process. Finally, lack of detectable 
spliced products connected to the Pol II active site in human HeLa or murine 
lymphoid cells suggests that splicing does not occur immediately following 3' 
splice site synthesis. Our results imply that most mammalian splicing requires 
exon definition for completion.
