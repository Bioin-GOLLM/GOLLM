The biological function of TRIM39, a member of TRIM family, remains largely 
unexplored in cancer, especially in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we 
show that TRIM39 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal 
tissues and associated with poor prognosis in CRC. Functional studies 
demonstrate that TRIM39 deficiency restrains CRC progression in vitro and in 
vivo. Our results further find that TRIM39 is a positive regulator of 
autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Mechanistically, TRIM39 interacts with Rab7 and 
promotes its activity via inhibiting its ubiquitination at lysine 191 residue. 
Depletion of TRIM39 inhibits CRC progression and autophagic flux in a Rab7 
activity-dependent manner. Moreover, TRIM39 deficiency suppresses CRC 
progression through inhibiting autophagic degradation of p53. Thus, our findings 
uncover the roles as well as the relevant mechanisms of TRIM39 in CRC and 
establish a functional relationship between autophagy and CRC progression, which 
may provide promising approaches for the treatment of CRC.
