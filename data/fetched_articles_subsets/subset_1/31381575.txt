The S-phase checkpoint plays an essential role in regulation of the 
ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity to maintain the dNTP pools. How 
eukaryotic cells respond appropriately to different levels of replication 
threats remains elusive. Here, we have identified that a conserved GSK-3 kinase 
Mck1 cooperates with Dun1 in regulating this process. Deleting MCK1 sensitizes 
dun1Δ to hydroxyurea (HU) reminiscent of mec1Δ or rad53Δ. While Mck1 is 
downstream of Rad53, it does not participate in the post-translational 
regulation of RNR as Dun1 does. Mck1 phosphorylates and releases the Crt1 
repressor from the promoters of DNA damage-inducible genes as RNR2-4 and HUG1. 
Hug1, an Rnr2 inhibitor normally silenced, is induced as a counterweight to 
excessive RNR. When cells suffer a more severe threat, Mck1 inhibits HUG1 
transcription. Consistently, only a combined deletion of HUG1 and CRT1, confers 
a dramatic boost of dNTP levels and the survival of mck1Δdun1Δ or mec1Δ cells 
assaulted by a lethal dose of HU. These findings reveal the division-of-labor 
between Mck1 and Dun1 at the S-phase checkpoint pathway to fine-tune dNTP 
homeostasis.
