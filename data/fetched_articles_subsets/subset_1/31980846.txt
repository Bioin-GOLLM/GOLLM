AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease affecting ~400,000 
people across the UK. It is likely that environmental factors trigger the 
disease process in genetically susceptible individuals. We assessed the 
associations between a wide range of environmental factors and childhood type 1 
diabetes incidence in England, using an agnostic, ecological environment-wide 
association study (EnWAS) approach, to generate hypotheses about environmental 
triggers.
METHODS: We undertook analyses at the local authority district (LAD) level using 
a national hospital episode statistics-based incident type 1 diabetes dataset 
comprising 13,948 individuals with diabetes aged 0-9Â years over the period April 
2000 to March 2011. We compiled LAD level estimates for a range of potential 
demographic and environmental risk factors including meteorological, land use 
and environmental pollution variables. The associations between type 1 diabetes 
incidence and risk factors were assessed via Poisson regression, disease mapping 
and ecological regression.
RESULTS: Case counts by LAD varied from 1 to 236 (median 33, interquartile range 
24-46). Overall type 1 diabetes incidence was 21.2 (95% CI 20.9, 21.6) per 
100,000 individuals. The EnWAS and disease mapping indicated that 15 out of 53 
demographic and environmental risk factors were significantly associated with 
diabetes incidence, after adjusting for multiple testing. These included air 
pollutants (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon 
monoxide; all inversely associated), as well as lead in soil, radon, outdoor 
light at night, overcrowding, population density and ethnicity. Disease mapping 
revealed spatial heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes risk. The ecological 
regression found an association between type 1 diabetes and the living 
environment domain of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (RR 0.995; 95% credible 
interval [CrI] 0.991, 0.998) and radon potential class (RR 1.044; 95% CrI 1.015, 
1.074).
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our analysis identifies a range of demographic and 
environmental factors associated with type 1 diabetes in children in England.
