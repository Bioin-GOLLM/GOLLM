Porto sinusoidal vascular liver disease (PSVD) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) 
are distinct vascular liver diseases characterized, respectively, by an 
intrahepatic and a prehepatic obstacle to the flow in the liver portal system. 
PVT may also occur as a complication of the natural history of PSVD, especially 
if a prothrombotic condition coexists. In other cases, it is associated to local 
and systemic pro-thrombotic conditions, even if its cause remains unknown in up 
to 25% despite an active search. In our opinion, the presence of PSVD should be 
suspected in patients with PVT especially in those with PVT "sine causa" and the 
active search of this condition should be included in their diagnostic work-out. 
However, sometimes the diagnosis of pre-existing PSVD is very hard. Biopsy 
cannot be fully discriminant as similar histological data have been described in 
both conditions. Liver stiffness may help as it has been shown to be higher in 
PSVD than in "pure" PVT, due to the presence of sclerosis in the portal venous 
radicles observable in PSVD patients. Nevertheless, comparing liver stiffness 
between PVT and PSVD has until now been restricted to very limited series of 
patients. In conclusion, even if it is still totally hypothetical, our point of 
view may have clinical consequences, especially when deciding to perform a liver 
biopsy in patients with a higher liver stiffness and suspending the 
anticoagulation in patients with PVT and no detectable prothrombotic factors.
