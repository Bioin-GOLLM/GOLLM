The combination of atazanavir (ATV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) with 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) has been used as a salvage 
regimen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. In this paper, 
we discuss two cases of HIV-positive patients who had long histories of 
virological failure following a heavy treatment of antiretroviral drugs, but 
then achieved virological suppression with double-boosted protease inhibitor 
(PI) regimens. In patients with multiple genotypic resistance to PIs and NRTIs, 
virological suppression can be achieved with a combination of ATV plus LPV/RTV 
with an NRTI backbone. The two cases in this report suggest that a combination 
of ATV plus LPV/RTV could be a useful salvage regimen for the subset of 
HIV-positive patients with limited treatment options.
