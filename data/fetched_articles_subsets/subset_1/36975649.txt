Presently, skin burns are considered one of the main public health problems and 
lack therapeutic options. In recent years, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have 
been widely studied, playing an increasingly important role in wound healing due 
to their antibacterial activity. This work is focused on the production and 
characterization of AgNPs loaded in a Pluronic® F127 hydrogel, as well as 
assessing its antimicrobial and wound-healing potential. Pluronic® F127 has been 
extensively explored for therapeutic applications mainly due to its appealing 
properties. The developed AgNPs had an average size of 48.04 ± 14.87 nm (when 
prepared by method C) and a negative surface charge. Macroscopically, the AgNPs 
solution presented a translucent yellow coloration with a characteristic 
absorption peak at 407 nm. Microscopically, the AgNPs presented a multiform 
morphology with small sizes (~50 nm). Skin permeation studies revealed that no 
AgNPs permeated the skin after 24 h. AgNPs further demonstrated antimicrobial 
activity against different bacterial species predominant in burns. A chemical 
burn model was developed to perform preliminary in vivo assays and the results 
showed that the performance of the developed AgNPs loaded in hydrogel, with 
smaller silver dose, was comparable with a commercial silver cream using higher 
doses. In conclusion, hydrogel-loaded AgNPs is potentially an important resource 
in the treatment of skin burns due to their proven efficacy by topical 
administration.
