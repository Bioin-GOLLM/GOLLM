Accurate prediction of lymph-node metastasis in cancers is pivotal for the next 
targeted clinical interventions that allow favorable prognosis for patients. 
Different molecular profiles (mRNA and non-coding RNAs) have been widely used to 
establish classifiers for cancer prediction (e.g., tumor origin, cancerous or 
non-cancerous state, cancer subtype). However, few studies focus on lymphatic 
metastasis evaluation using these profiles, and the performance of classifiers 
based on different profiles has also not been compared. Here, differentially 
expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs between lymph-node metastatic and 
non-metastatic groups were identified as molecular signatures to construct 
classifiers for lymphatic metastasis prediction in different cancers. With this 
similar feature selection strategy, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers 
based on different profiles were systematically compared in their prediction 
performance. For representative cancers (a total of nine types), these 
classifiers achieved comparative overall accuracies of 81.00% (67.96-92.19%), 
81.97% (70.83-95.24%), and 80.78% (69.61-90.00%) on independent mRNA, miRNA, and 
lncRNA datasets, with a small set of biomarkers (6, 12, and 4 on average). 
Therefore, our proposed feature selection strategies are economical and 
efficient to identify biomarkers that aid in developing competitive classifiers 
for predicting lymph-node metastasis in cancers. A user-friendly webserver was 
also deployed to help researchers in metastasis risk determination by submitting 
their expression profiles of different origins.
