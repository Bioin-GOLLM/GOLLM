BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a complex chronic inflammatory disease of 
the nasal mucosa, caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental 
factors. As evidence suggests that some genetic variants may increase 
susceptibility to both AR and asthma, the objective of this study was to 
identify asthma susceptibility variants associated with AR in the Chinese 
population.
METHODS: A cohort of 402 individuals with physician-diagnosed AR and 416 healthy 
controls were recruited from the Han Chinese population in Beijing. DNA was 
extracted from the peripheral blood and a total of 12 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) shown to be associated with asthma in Japanese subjects 
were selected for genotyping using the SequenomMassARRAY technology platform.
RESULTS: Analysis of frequency differences of allele between the AR patients and 
control subjects showed that the C allele of rs204993 in the pre-B-cell leukemia 
homeobox 2 (PBX2) gene from the 6p21.3 locus was significantly associated with 
AR (p = 0.0006, pcorrected = 0.0340). Genotype analysis further confirmed the 
difference in distribution of this variant between AR patients and controls in 
the both the dominant (pT/C+C/C vs T/T = 7.37×10(-5) ) and co-dominant (pT/C vs 
T/T = 1.98 × 10(-4) , pC/C vs T/T = 0.004) models.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the PBX2 gene in the 6p21.3 asthma 
susceptibility locus may be associated with increased risk for both AR and 
asthma in Chinese subjects.
