Malassezia includes yeasts belong to the subphylum Ustilaginomycotina within the 
Basidiomycota. Malassezia yeasts are commonly found as commensals on human and 
animal skin. Nevertheless, Malassezia species are also associated with several 
skin disorders, such as dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, atopic eczema, 
pityriasis versicolor, and folliculitis. More recently, associations of 
Malassezia with Crohn's disease, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and cystic 
fibrosis pulmonary exacerbation have been reported. The increasing availability 
of genomic and molecular tools have played a crucial role in understanding the 
genetic basis of Malassezia commensalism and pathogenicity. In the present 
review we report genomics advances in Malassezia highlighting unique features 
that potentially impacted Malassezia biology and host adaptation. Furthermore, 
we describe the recently developed protocols for Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens-mediated transformation in Malassezia, and their applications for 
random insertional mutagenesis or targeted gene replacement strategies.
