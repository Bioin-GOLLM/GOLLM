V-domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) is an inhibitory 
immune-checkpoint molecule that suppresses CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation when 
expressed on antigen-presenting cells. Vsir -/- mice developed loss of 
peripheral tolerance and multi-organ chronic inflammatory phenotypes. Vsir -/- 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were hyper-responsive towards self- and foreign antigens. 
Whether or not VISTA regulates innate immunity is unknown. Using a murine model 
of psoriasis induced by TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ), we show that VISTA 
deficiency exacerbated psoriasiform inflammation. Enhanced TLR7 signaling in 
Vsir -/- dendritic cells (DCs) led to the hyper-activation of Erk1/2 and Jnk1/2, 
and augmented the production of IL-23. IL-23, in turn, promoted the expression 
of IL-17A in both TCRγδ+ T cells and CD4+ Th17 cells. Furthermore, VISTA 
regulates the peripheral homeostasis of CD27- γδ T cells and their activation 
upon TCR-mediated or cytokine-mediated stimulation. IL-17A-producing CD27- γδ T 
cells were expanded in the Vsir -/- mice and amplified the inflammatory cascade. 
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that VISTA critically regulates the 
inflammatory responses mediated by DCs and IL-17-producing TCRγδ+ and CD4+ Th17 
T cells following TLR7 stimulation. Our finding provides a rationale for 
therapeutically enhancing VISTA-mediated pathways to benefit the treatment of 
autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
