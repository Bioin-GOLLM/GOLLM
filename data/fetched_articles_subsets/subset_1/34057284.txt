INTRODUCTION: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for neurofibrillary tau 
allows investigation of the in vivo spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathology. We evaluated the suitability of 18 F-MK-6240 in a 
clinical sample and determined the relationships among 18 F-MK-6240 binding, 
age, cognition, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based AD biomarkers.
METHODS: Participants (n = 101, 72 ± 9 years, 52% women) underwent amyloid PET, 
tau PET, structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 
neuropsychological evaluation. Twenty-one participants had lumbar puncture for 
CSF measurement of amyloid beta (Aβ)42 , tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau).
RESULTS: 18 F-MK-6240 recapitulated Braak staging and correlated with CSF tau 
and p-tau, normalized to Aβ42 . 18 F-MK-6240 negatively correlated with age 
across Braak regions in amyloid-positive participants, consistent with greater 
tau pathology in earlier onset AD. Domain-specific, regional patterns of 18 
F-MK-6240 binding were associated with reduced memory, executive, and language 
performance, but only in amyloid-positive participants.
DISCUSSION: 18 F-MK-6240 can approximate Braak staging across the AD continuum 
and provide region-dependent insights into biomarker-based AD models.
