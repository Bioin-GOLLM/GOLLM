Primary ciliary dyskinesia, with or without situs abnormalities, is a rare lung 
disease that can lead to an irreversible lung damage that may progress to 
respiratory failure. Lung transplant can be considered in end-stage disease. 
This study describes the outcomes of the largest lung transplant population for 
PCD and for PCD with situs abnormalities, also identified as Kartagener's 
syndrome. Retrospectively collected data of 36 patients who underwent lung 
transplantation for PCD from 1995 to 2020 with or without SA as part of the 
European Society of Thoracic Surgeons Lung Transplantation Working Group on rare 
diseases. Primary outcomes of interest included survival and freedom from 
chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Secondary outcomes included primary graft 
dysfunction within 72 h and the rate of rejection ≥A2 within the first year. 
Among PCD recipients with and without SA, the mean overall and CLAD-free 
survival were 5.9 and 5.2 years with no significant differences between groups 
in terms of time to CLAD (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.27-3.14, p = 0.894) or mortality 
(HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.14-1.43, p = 0.178). Postoperative rates of PGD were 
comparable between groups; rejection grades ≥A2 on first biopsy or within the 
first year was more common in patients with SA. This study provides a valuable 
insight on international practices of lung transplantation in patients with PCD. 
Lung transplantation is an acceptable treatment option in this population.
