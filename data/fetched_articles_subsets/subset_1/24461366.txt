The molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) remains poorly understood. Using basal forebrain cholinergic neurons 
(BFCNs) as a model and immunohistochemistry, we have demonstrated significant 
age-related loss of the calcium-binding protein calbindin-D(28K) (CB) from BFCN, 
which was associated with tangle formation and degeneration in AD. Here, we 
determined alterations in RNA and protein for CB and the Ca(2+)-responsive 
proteins Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI), growth-associated 
protein-43 (GAP43), and calpain in the BF. We observed progressive 
downregulation of CB and CaMKI RNA in laser-captured BFCN in the normal-aged-AD 
continuum. We also detected progressive loss of CB, CaMKIδ, and GAP43 proteins 
in BF homogenates in aging and AD. Activated μ-calpain, a calcium-sensitive 
protease that degrades CaMKI and GAP43, was significantly increased in the 
normal aged BF and was 10 times higher in AD BF. Overactivation of μ-calpain was 
confirmed using proteolytic fragments of its substrate spectrin. Substantial 
age- and AD-related alterations in Ca(2+)-sensing proteins most likely 
contribute to selective vulnerability of BFCN to degeneration in AD.
