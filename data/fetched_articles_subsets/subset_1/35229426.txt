Plant immune responses must be tightly controlled for proper allocation of 
resources for growth and development. In plants, endogenous signaling peptides 
regulate developmental and growth-related processes. Recent research indicates 
that some of these peptides also have regulatory functions in the control of 
plant immune responses. This classifies these peptides as phytocytokines as they 
show analogies with metazoan cytokines. However, the mechanistic basis for 
phytocytokine-mediated regulation of plant immunity remains largely elusive. 
Here, we identify GOLVEN2 (GLV2) peptides as phytocytokines in Arabidopsis 
thaliana. GLV2 signaling enhances sensitivity of plants to elicitation with 
immunogenic bacterial elicitors and contributes to resistance against virulent 
bacterial pathogens. GLV2 is perceived by ROOT MERISTEM GROWTH FACTOR 1 
INSENSITIVE (RGI) receptors. RGI mutants show reduced elicitor sensitivity and 
enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection. RGI3 forms ligand-induced 
complexes with the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE 2 
(FLS2), suggesting that RGIs are part of PRR signaling platforms. GLV2-RGI 
signaling promotes PRR abundance independent of transcriptional regulation and 
controls plant immunity via a previously undescribed mechanism of phytocytokine 
activity.
