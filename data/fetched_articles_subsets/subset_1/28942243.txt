Chemoresistance remains a major drawback to osteosarcoma treatment. ZBTB7A, a 
member of the POK transcription repressor family, was shown to play an important 
role in tumorigenesis. However, the effect of ZBTB7A on osteosarcoma 
chemoresistance is completely unknown. In this study, we found that ZBTB7A is 
increased in cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cells and that elevated ZBTB7A 
inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis by repressing LINC00473 expression. Further 
mechanistic studies revealed that ZBTB7A directly binds to the promoter and 
suppresses the transcription of LINC00473. Additionally, our data indicate that 
LINC00473 interacts with the transcript factor C/EBPβ, facilitating its binding 
to the promoter of IL24, leading to decrease chemoresistance. Thus, these 
findings indicate that the ZBTB7A-mediated LINC00473-C/EBPβ-IL24 pathway is a 
promising novel target for overcoming cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma.
