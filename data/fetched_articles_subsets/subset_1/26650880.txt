BACKGROUND: Mendelian Randomization (MR) studies have reported that type 2 
diabetes (T2D) was not associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). We adopted a 
modified, mechanism-specific MR design to explore this surprising result.
METHODS: Using inverse-variance weighted MR analysis, we evaluated the 
association between T2D and AD using data from 39 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with T2D in DIAbetes Genetics 
Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) and the corresponding associations of 
each SNP with AD risk obtained from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's 
Project (IGAP, n=17,008 AD cases and n=37,154 controls). We evaluated 
mechanism-specific genetic subscores, including β-cell function, insulin 
sensitivity, and adiposity, and repeated analyses in 8501 Health and Retirement 
Study participants for replication and model validation.
RESULTS: In IGAP, the overall T2D polygenic score did not predict AD [odds ratio 
(OR) for the T2D polygenic score=1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96, 1.06] 
but the insulin sensitivity polygenic score predicted higher AD risk (OR=1.17; 
95% CI, 1.02, 1.34). In the Health and Retirement Study, polygenic scores were 
associated with T2D risk; the associations between insulin sensitivity genetic 
polygenic score and cognitive phenotypes were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from polygenic scores suggests that insulin sensitivity 
specifically may affect AD risk, more than T2D overall.
