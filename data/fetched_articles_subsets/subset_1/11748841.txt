Adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) causes primary adrenal insufficiency due to 
the failure of development of the adrenal cortex. Clinical and pedigree data 
indicate that the condition is genetically heterogeneous. The predominant 
adrenal hypoplasia congenita locus, however, is the NR0B1 gene, at Xp21, 
encoding the protein DAX1. In this article, we present a compendium of published 
NR0B1 mutations and polymorphisms, and discuss them in the contexts of known 
biology and clinical applicability. The recent descriptions of patients with 
primary adrenal insufficiency due to mutations of NR5A1, which encodes SF1, are 
also discussed.
