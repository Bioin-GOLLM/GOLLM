RATIONALE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal 
neurodegenerative disease. However, the misdiagnosis of ALS always occurs 
because of atypical clinical manifestations. Since mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide 
dismutase 1 (SOD1) have been implicated as causative and account for 20% of fALS 
cases, early genetic sequencing of suspected individuals in ALS pedigrees could 
be helpful.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report a Chinese family spanning three generations 
with fALS. A heterozygous c.125G>A (p.Gly42Asp) missense mutation in exon 2 of 
SOD1 gene was detected in our proband as well as her 2 siblings and next 
generation. Phenotypic diversity was also reported among symptomatic 
individuals.
DIAGNOSES: Peripheral blood samples from the proband were collected and sent for 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing of the SOD1 gene at 
Sanvalley Diagnostics. The other 11 members in the studied family then underwent 
locus verification.
INTERVENTIONS: Butylphthalide, Vitamin B12, Coenzyme Q10 and mouse nerve growth 
factor is given to the symptomatic members.
OUTCOMES: The symptoms of our proband was not improved by treatments at a late 
stage. She passed away the fourth year of the disease due to respiratory 
failure. Two siblings of the proband were given active treatments once verified 
as carrier. Their symptoms are still limited to limb weakness.
LESSONS: This study suggests genetic sequencing is a powerful tool for the 
diagnosis of familial ALS. Phenotypic heterogeneity exists among G41D-mutated 
individuals, which further highlights the importance of genomic strategies for 
early diagnosis.
