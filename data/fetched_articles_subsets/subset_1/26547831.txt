The family of Shank scaffolding molecules (comprising Shank1, 2 and 3) are core 
components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) in neuronal synapses. Shanks link 
surface receptors to other scaffolding molecules within the PSD, as well as to 
the actin cytoskeleton. However, determining the function of Shank proteins in 
neurons has been complicated because the different Shank isoforms share a very 
high degree of sequence and domain homology. Therefore, to control Shank content 
while minimizing potential compensatory effects, a miRNA-based knockdown 
strategy was developed to reduce the expression of all synaptically targeted 
Shank isoforms simultaneously in rat hippocampal neurons. Using this approach, a 
strong (>75%) reduction in total Shank protein levels was achieved at individual 
dendritic spines, prompting an approximately 40% decrease in mushroom spine 
density. Furthermore, Shank knockdown reduced spine actin levels and increased 
sensitivity to the actin depolymerizing agent Latrunculin A. A SHANK2 mutant 
lacking the proline-rich cortactin-binding motif (SHANK2-ΔPRO) was unable to 
rescue these defects. Furthermore, Shank knockdown reduced cortactin levels in 
spines and increased the mobility of spine cortactin as measured by 
single-molecule tracking photoactivated localization microscopy, suggesting that 
Shank proteins recruit and stabilize cortactin at the synapse. Furthermore, it 
was found that Shank knockdown significantly reduced spontaneous remodelling of 
synapse morphology that could not be rescued by the SHANK2-ΔPRO mutant. It was 
concluded that Shank proteins are key intermediates between the synapse and the 
spine interior that, via cortactin, permit the actin cytoskeleton to dynamically 
regulate synapse morphology and function.
