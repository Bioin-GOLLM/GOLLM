Cell death is a fundamental physiological process in all living organisms. Its 
roles extend from embryonic development, organ maintenance, and aging to the 
coordination of immune responses and autoimmunity. In recent years, our 
understanding of the mechanisms orchestrating cellular death and its 
consequences on immunity and homeostasis has increased substantially. Different 
modalities of what has become known as 'programmed cell death' have been 
described, and some key players in these processes have been identified. We have 
learned more about the intricacies that fine tune the activity of common players 
and ultimately shape the different types of cell death. These studies have 
highlighted the complex mechanisms tipping the balance between different cell 
fates. Here, we summarize the latest discoveries in the three most well 
understood modalities of cell death, namely, apoptosis, necroptosis, and 
pyroptosis, highlighting common and unique pathways and their effect on the 
surrounding cells and the organism as a whole.
