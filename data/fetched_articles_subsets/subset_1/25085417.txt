Monoubiquitylation of histone H2B on Lys123 (H2BK123ub1) plays a multifaceted 
role in diverse DNA-templated processes, yet the mechanistic details by which 
this modification is regulated are not fully elucidated. Here we show in yeast 
that H2BK123ub1 is regulated in part through the protein stability of the E3 
ubiquitin ligase Bre1. We found that Bre1 stability is controlled by the Rtf1 
subunit of the polymerase-associated factor (PAF) complex and through the 
ability of Bre1 to catalyze H2BK123ub1. Using a domain in Rtf1 that stabilizes 
Bre1, we show that inappropriate Bre1 levels lead to defects in gene regulation. 
Collectively, these data uncover a novel quality control mechanism used by the 
cell to maintain proper Bre1 and H2BK123ub1 levels, thereby ensuring proper 
control of gene expression.
