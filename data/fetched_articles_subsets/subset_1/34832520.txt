In 2021 the scientific community's efforts have been focused on solving the 
back-breaking challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, but sexually transmitted 
infections (STI) are still one of the most common global health problems. 
Syphilis is a systemic disease caused by the spirochaete Treponema pallidum (TP) 
and is one of the oldest known diseases. Its incidence has increased in the last 
few years and syphilis still remains a contemporary plague that continues to 
afflict millions of people worldwide. Despite research improvements, syphilis 
pathogenesis is not completely clear; clinical presentation is very 
heterogeneous and the diagnosis can sometimes be difficult. Furthermore, few 
therapeutic options are available, and a vaccine has not been found yet. In this 
review, we describe the most recent evidence concerning the clinical 
manifestation, diagnosis, treatment and vaccine prospectives for this disease.
