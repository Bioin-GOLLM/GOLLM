INTRODUCTION: Local anesthetic infusion techniques have been reported to reduce 
opiate requirements and pain scores following different kinds of surgery, 
including orthopedic surgery, inguinal hernia, and Cesarean surgery in women.
METHODS: PRF-108 and PRF-110 formulations were applied to the wound space in an 
incisional model in pigs to test the hypothesis that these formulations have 
better and longer analgesic effects than the commercially available ropivacaine 
solution (Naropin(Â®), AstraZeneca).
RESULTS: The data show significantly better analgesic activity with PRF-108 and 
PRF-110 compared to ropivacaine. The duration of the analgesic efficacy of 
PRF-108 and PRF-110 was at least five times longer than that was measured 
following treatment with ropivacaine. The data further suggest that active 
clearance from the injection site (the wound) is much slower for PRF-108 and 
PRF-110 than for the commercial ropivacaine solution.
CONCLUSION: Assessing the local concentration of PRF compounds and commercially 
available ropivacaine solution suggests that active clearance from the injection 
site (the wound) is much slower for PRF-108 and PRF-110 than for ropivacaine.
