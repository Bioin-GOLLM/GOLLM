BACKGROUND: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC), an inherited and rare disease prevalent 
in males, is clinically manifested by reticulate hyperpigmentation, nail 
dystrophy, and leukoplakia. DC is associated with the increased risk of 
malignancy and other potentially lethal complications such as bone marrow 
failure, as well as lung and liver diseases. Mutations in 19 genes were found to 
be correlated with DC. Herein, we report a 12-year-old boy carrying a de novo 
mutation in TINF2 gene.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on DNA sample of the 
proband, and the variant was investigated in the family by Sanger sequencing. 
Population and bioinformatics analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The NM_ 001099274.3(TINF2): c.844C>T (p.Arg282Cys) mutation was found 
by WES.
CONCLUSION: There was no history of the disease in the family, and the variant 
was classified as a de novo mutation.
