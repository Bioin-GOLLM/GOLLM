Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) constitute a group of disorders identified 
by an overproduction of cells derived from myeloid lineage. The majority of MPNs 
have an identifiable driver mutation responsible for cytokine-independent 
proliferative signalling. The acquisition of coexisting mutations in chromatin 
modifiers, spliceosome complex components, DNA methylation modifiers, tumour 
suppressors and transcriptional regulators have been identified as major 
pathways for disease progression and leukemic transformation. They also confer 
different sensitivities to therapeutic options. This review will explore the 
molecular basis of MPN pathogenesis and specifically examine the impact of 
coexisting mutations on disease biology and therapeutic options.
