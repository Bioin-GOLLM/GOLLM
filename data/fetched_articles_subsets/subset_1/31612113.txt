microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by modulating the translation of 
protein-coding RNAs. Their aberrant expression is involved in various human 
diseases, including cancer. Here, we summarize the experimental pieces of 
evidence that proved how dysregulated miRNA expression can lead to RAS (HRAS, 
KRAS, or NRAS) activation irrespective of their oncogenic mutations. These 
findings revealed relevant pathogenic mechanisms as well as mechanisms of 
resistance to target therapies. Based on this knowledge, potential approaches 
for the control of RAS oncogenic activation can be envisioned.
