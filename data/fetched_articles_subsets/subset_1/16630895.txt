Proteins of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family are remarkable in 
their ability to bind an extremely diverse range of protein and lipoprotein 
ligands, yet the basis for ligand recognition is poorly understood. Here, we 
report the 1.26 A X-ray structure of a complex between a two-module region of 
the ligand binding domain of the LDLR and the third domain of RAP, an escort 
protein for LDLR family members. The RAP domain forms a three-helix bundle with 
two docking sites, one for each LDLR module. The mode of recognition at each 
site is virtually identical: three conserved, calcium-coordinating acidic 
residues from each LDLR module encircle a lysine side chain protruding from the 
second helix of RAP. This metal-dependent mode of electrostatic recognition, 
together with avidity effects resulting from the use of multiple sites, 
represents a general binding strategy likely to apply in the binding of other 
basic ligands to LDLR family proteins.
