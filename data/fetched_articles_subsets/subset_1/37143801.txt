Saccharides displayed on the cell surface of pathogens play critical roles in 
many activities such as adhesion, recognition and pathogenesis, as well as in 
prokaryotic development. In this work, we report the synthesis of molecularly 
imprinted nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) against pathogen surface monosaccharides 
using an innovative solid-phase approach. These nanoMIPs can serve as robust and 
selective artificial lectins specific to one particular monosaccharide. The 
evaluation of their binding capabilities has been implemented against bacterial 
cells (E. coli and S. pneumoniae) as model pathogens. The nanoMIPs were produced 
against two different monosaccharides: mannose (Man), which is present mainly on 
the surface of Gram-negative bacteria, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) exposed 
on the surface of the majority of bacteria. Herein, we assessed the potential 
use of nanoMIPs for pathogen cell imaging and detection via flow cytometry and 
confocal microscopy.
