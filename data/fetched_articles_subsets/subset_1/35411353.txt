Heart disease is the leading cause of death globally, and delivery of 
therapeutic cargo (e.g., particles loaded with proteins, drugs, or genes and 
cells) through direct injection into the myocardium is a promising clinical 
intervention. However, retention of deliverables to the contracting myocardium 
is low, with as much as 60-90% of payload being lost within 24 hr. 
Commercially-available injectable hydrogels, including Matrigel, have been 
hypothesized to increase payload retention but have not yielded significant 
improvements in quantified analyses. Here, we assess a recombinant hydrogel 
composed of chemically modified hyaluronan and elastin-like protein (HELP) as an 
alternative injectable carrier to increase cargo retention. HELP is crosslinked 
using dynamic covalent bonds, and tuning the hyaluronan chemistry significantly 
alters hydrogel mechanical properties including stiffness, stress relaxation 
rate, and ease of injectability through a needle or catheter. These materials 
can be injected even after complete crosslinking, extending the time window for 
surgical delivery. We show that HELP gels significantly improve in vivo 
retention of microsphere cargo compared to Matrigel, both 1 day and 7 days 
post-injection directly into the rat myocardium. These data suggest that HELP 
gels may assist with the clinical translation of therapeutic cargo designed for 
delivery into the contracting myocardium by preventing acute cargo loss.
