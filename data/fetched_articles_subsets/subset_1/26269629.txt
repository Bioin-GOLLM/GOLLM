Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major movement disorder characterized by the loss 
of dopamine neurons and formation of Lewy bodies. Clinical and pathological 
evidence indicates that multiple brain regions are affected in PD in a 
spatiotemporal manner and are associated with a variety of motor and nonmotor 
symptoms, including disturbances in mood, executive function, and memory. The 
common PD-associated gene for leucine-rich repeat kinase, leucine-rich repeat 
kinase 2 (LRRK2), is highly expressed in brain regions that are involved with 
nonmotor functions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, but whether mutant 
LRRK2 contributes to neuronal dysfunction in these regions is unknown. Here, we 
use bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse models of LRRK2 to explore 
potential nonmotor mechanisms of PD. Through electrophysiological analysis of 
the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in dorsal hippocampus, we find that 
overexpression of LRRK2-G2019S increases basal synaptic efficiency through a 
postsynaptic mechanism, and disrupts long-term depression. Furthermore, these 
effects of the G2019S mutation are age dependent and can be normalized by acute 
inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type 
LRRK2 has no effect under the same conditions, suggesting a specific phenotype 
for the G2019S mutation. These results identify a pathogenic function of LRRK2 
in the hippocampus that may contribute to nonmotor symptoms of PD.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Parkinson's disease (PD) is among the most common 
neurological diseases and is best known for its adverse effects on brain regions 
that control motor function, resulting in tremor, rigidity, and gait 
abnormalities. Less well appreciated are the psychiatric symptoms experienced by 
many PD patients, including depression and memory loss, which do not respond 
well to currently available treatments for PD. Here, we describe functional 
effects of a common PD-linked mutation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 in the 
mouse hippocampus, an area of the brain that is responsible for encoding and 
retaining memories. By providing a potential mechanism for some of the cognitive 
symptoms produced by this mutation, our findings may lead to novel approaches 
for the treatment of nonmotor symptoms of PD.
