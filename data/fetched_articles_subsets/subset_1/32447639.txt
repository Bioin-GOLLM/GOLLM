Bimatoprost implant (Durystaâ„¢), developed by Allergan, is a sustained-release 
drug delivery system containing bimatoprost, a prostaglandin analogue with 
ocular hypotensive activity. The implant, administered intracamerally, involves 
the use of a biodegradable, solid polymer drug delivery system for slow, 
sustained drug release, designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) over a 4- 
to 6-months period. In March 2020, bimatoprost implant received its first 
approval, in the USA, for use to reduce IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma 
(OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). Allergan's clinical development programme 
for bimatoprost implant is ongoing. This article summarizes the milestones in 
the development of bimatoprost implant leading to this first approval for use in 
the reduction of IOP in patients with OAG or OHT.
