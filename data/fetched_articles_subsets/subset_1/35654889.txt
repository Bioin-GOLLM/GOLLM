Lactic acidosis has been reported in solid tumor microenvironment (TME) 
including glioblastoma (GBM). In TME, several signaling molecules, growth 
factors and metabolites have been identified to induce resistance to 
chemotherapy and to sustain immune escape. In the early phases of the disease, 
microglia infiltrates TME, contributing to tumorigenesis rather than 
counteracting its growth. Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 6 (IGFBP6) 
is expressed during tumor development, and it is involved in migration, 
immune-escape and inflammation, thus providing an attractive target for GBM 
therapy. Here, we aimed at investigating the crosstalk between lactate 
metabolism and IGFBP6 in TME and GBM progression. Our results show that 
microglia exposed to lactate or IGFBP6 significantly increased the 
Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression together with genes involved in 
mitochondrial metabolism. We, also, observed an increase in the M2 markers and a 
reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels, suggesting a role of 
lactate/IGFBP6 metabolism in immune-escape activation. GBM cells exposed to 
lactate also showed increased levels of IGFBP6 and vice-versa. Such a phenomenon 
was coupled with a IGFBP6-mediated sonic hedgehog (SHH) ignaling increase. We, 
finally, tested our hypothesis in a GBM zebrafish animal model, where we 
observed an increase in microglia cells and igfbp6 gene expression after lactate 
exposure. Our results were confirmed by the analysis of human transcriptomes 
datasets and immunohistochemical assay from human GBM biopsies, suggesting the 
existence of a lactate/IGFBP6 crosstalk in microglial cells, so that IGFBP6 
expression is regulated by lactate production in GBM cells and in turn modulates 
microglia polarization.
