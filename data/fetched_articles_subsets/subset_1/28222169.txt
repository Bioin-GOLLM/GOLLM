In tissue engineering, an ideal scaffold attracts and supports cells thus 
providing them with the necessary mechanical support and architecture as they 
reconstruct new tissue in vitro and in vivo. This manuscript details a novel 
matrix derived from decellularized Wharton's jelly (WJ) obtained from human 
umbilical cord for use as a scaffold for tissue engineering application. This 
decellularized Wharton's jelly matrix (DWJM) contained 0.66 ± 0.12 μg/mg 
sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and was abundant in hyaluronic acid, and 
completely devoid of cells. Mass spectroscopy revealed the presence of collagen 
types II, VI and XII, fibronectin-I, and lumican I. When seeded onto DWJM, WJ 
mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs), successfully attached to, and penetrated the 
porous matrix resulting in a slower rate of cell proliferation. Gene expression 
analysis of WJ and bone marrow (BM) MSCs cultured on DWJM demonstrated decreased 
expression of proliferation genes with no clear pattern of differentiation. When 
this matrix was implanted into a murine calvarial defect model with, green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled osteocytes, the osteocytes were observed to 
migrate into the matrix as early as 24 hours. They were also identified in the 
matrix up to 14 days after transplantation. Together with these findings, we 
conclude that DWJM can be used as a 3D porous, bioactive and biocompatible 
scaffold for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.

performed research studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies 
(Bayer-Schering, Celgene, GSK, Mundipharma, Novartis, Purdue, Sanofi-Aventis,
