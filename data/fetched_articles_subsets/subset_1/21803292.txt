Opposing activities of acetyltransferases and deacetylases help regulate energy 
balance. Mice heterozygous for the acetyltransferase CREB binding protein (CBP) 
are lean and insulin sensitized, but how CBP regulates energy homeostasis is 
unclear. In one model, the main CBP interaction with the glucagon-responsive 
factor CREB is not limiting for liver gluconeogenesis, whereas a second model 
posits that Ser436 in the CH1 (TAZ1) domain of CBP is required for insulin and 
the antidiabetic drug metformin to inhibit CREB-mediated liver gluconeogenesis. 
Here we show that conditional knockout of CBP in liver does not decrease fasting 
blood glucose or gluconeogenic gene expression, consistent with the first model. 
However, mice in which the CBP CH1 domain structure is disrupted by deleting 
residues 342-393 (ΔCH1) are lean and insulin sensitized, as are p300ΔCH1 
mutants. CBP(ΔCH1/ΔCH1) mice remain metformin responsive. An intact CH1 domain 
is thus necessary for normal energy storage, but not for the blood 
glucose-lowering actions of insulin and metformin.
