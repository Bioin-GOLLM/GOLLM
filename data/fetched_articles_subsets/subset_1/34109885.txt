Large numbers of mink have been infected with SARS-CoV2 containing the spike 
protein Y453F mutation in Europe, causing zoonosis concerns. To evaluate the 
genetic characteristics of the U.S. and Canadian mink-derived SARS-CoV2 
sequences, we analyzed all animal-derived (977) and all Canadian (19,529) and 
U.S. (173,277) SARS-CoV2 sequences deposited in GISAID from December 2019 to 
March 12, 2021, and identified 2 dominant novel variants, the N501T-G142D 
variant and N501T-G142D-F486L variant, in the U.S. mink-derived SARS-CoV2 
sequences. These variants were not found in mink from Canada or other countries. 
The Y453F mutation was not identified in the mink-derived sequences in the 
United States and Canada. The N501T mutation occurred 2â€‰mo earlier in humans 
than in mink in the United States, and the novel N501T-G142D and 
N501T-G142D-F486L variants were found in humans prior to mink. Our results 
suggest that the novel SARS-CoV2 variants may have evolved during human 
infection and were then transmitted to mink populations in the United States.
