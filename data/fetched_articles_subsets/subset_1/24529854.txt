BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene are associated 
with the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in different populations. However, the 
genetic susceptibility to TB in Han Chinese living in Taiwan is still unknown. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the polymorphisms of the IFN-γ 
gene are associated with TB in Han Taiwanese.
METHODS: A total of 200 TB patients and 202 age-matched non-TB individuals were 
enrolled. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) and rs2430561 (+874) 
of IFN-γ were selected from a public database. The genotypes were determined 
using polymerase chain reaction assays.
RESULTS: Three IFN-γ polymorphisms in intron 3, rs1861494 and rs2069718, and 
rs2430561 in interon 1 were strongly associated with TB. The C carrier (CT+TT) 
of rs1861494, TT homozygous of rs2069718, and AA homozygous of rs2430561 were 
risk genotypes for susceptibility to TB.
CONCLUSION: The IFN-γ polymorphisms, rs1861494, rs2069718, and rs2430561, may 
confer the risk of TB in Han Taiwanese.
