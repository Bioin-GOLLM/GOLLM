In this proof-of-concept study, the antioxidant activity of phytocannabinoids, 
namely cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), were investigated 
using an in vitro system of differentiated human neuronal SY-SH5Y cells. The 
oxidative stress was induced by hydrogen peroxide, as reactive oxygen species 
(ROS). Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathological conditions were mimicked in 
vitro by treating the differentiated neuronal cells with amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42) 
in the presence of Cu(II). We showed that THC had a high potency to combat 
oxidative stress in both in vitro models, while CBD did not show a remarkable 
antioxidant activity. The cannabis extracts also exhibited a significant 
antioxidant activity, which depended on the ratio of the THC and CBD. However, 
our results did not suggest any antagonist effect of the CBD on the antioxidant 
activity of THC. The effect of cannabis extracts on the cell viability of 
differentiated human neuronal SY-SH5Y cells was also investigated, which 
emphasized the differences between the bioactivity of cannabis extracts due to 
their composition. Our preliminary results demonstrated that cannabis extracts 
and phytocannabinoids have a promising potential as antioxidants, which can be 
further investigated to develop novel pharmaceuticals targeting oxidative stress 
therapy.
