INTRODUCTION: We conducted a meta-analysis to dissect the association between 
PIK3CA mutations (exon 9 and exon 20) and resistance to anti-epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) in KRAS wild-type 
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 11 previously published studies, 864 cancer patients 
were treated with cetuximab or panitumumab-based therapy. Primary outcomes 
included objective response (complete response + partial response vs. stable 
disease + progressive disease), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS). We calculated the odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the risk or hazard. We found consistent 
and clinically substantial risk or hazard for objective response, PFS, and OS in 
the cetuximab or panitumumab-treated mCRC patients.
RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations as a whole were associated with reduced response and 
poor PFS and OS in KRAS wild-type mCRC patients (objective response: OR = 0.42 
and 95% CI 0.23-0.75; PFS: HR = 1.54 and 95% CI 1.13-2.09; and OS: HR = 1.4 and 
95% CI 1.02-1.91). PIK3CA exon 9 mutations had no effect, whereas exon 20 
mutations were associated with a worse outcome compared with wild types, with an 
OR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.05-0.93).
CONCLUSIONS: PIK3CA mutations as a whole might be useful prognostic factors for 
assessing clinical outcomes of anti-EGFR MoAb-based chemotherapies in KRAS 
wild-type mCRC patients. In particular, PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were 
significantly associated with lack of response.
