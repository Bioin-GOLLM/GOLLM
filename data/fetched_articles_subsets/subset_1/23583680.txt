The identification of endogenous targets remains an important challenge in 
understanding microRNA (miRNA) function. Past approaches using in silico methods 
and reporter constructs lack biological context that may enhance or inhibit 
target recognition. To address these limitations, several labs have utilized 
crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of Argonaute (Ago) proteins to 
identify miRNA targets. Recently, the Ule Lab introduced individual-nucleotide 
resolution CLIP (iCLIP) to increase the sensitivity of identifying protein-RNA 
interaction sites. Here we adapt the iCLIP protocol for use in Caenorhabditis 
elegans to identify endogenous sites targeted by the worm Argonaute (ALG-1) 
primarily responsible for miRNA function.
