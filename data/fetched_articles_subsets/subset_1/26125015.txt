Protein glycosylation is an important epigenetic modifying process affecting 
expression, localization, and function of numerous proteins required for normal 
immune function. Recessive germline mutations in genes responsible for protein 
glycosylation processes result in congenital disorders of glycosylation and can 
have profound immunologic consequences. Genetic mutations in immune signaling 
pathways that affect glycosylation sites have also been shown to cause disease. 
Sugar supplementation and in vivo alteration of glycans by medication holds 
therapeutic promise for some of these disorders. Further understanding of how 
changes in glycosylation alter immunity may provide novel treatment approaches 
for allergic disease, immune dysregulation, and immunodeficiency in the future.
