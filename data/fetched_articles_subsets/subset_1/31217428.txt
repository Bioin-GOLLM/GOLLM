The MUSASHI (MSI) family of RNA binding proteins (MSI1 and MSI2) contribute to a 
wide spectrum of cancers including acute myeloid leukemia. We find that the 
small molecule Ro 08-2750 (Ro) binds directly and selectively to MSI2 and 
competes for its RNA binding in biochemical assays. Ro treatment in mouse and 
human myeloid leukemia cells results in an increase in differentiation and 
apoptosis, inhibition of known MSI-targets, and a shared global gene expression 
signature similar to shRNA depletion of MSI2. Ro demonstrates in vivo inhibition 
of c-MYC and reduces disease burden in a murine AML leukemia model. Thus, we 
identify a small molecule that targets MSI's oncogenic activity. Our study 
provides a framework for targeting RNA binding proteins in cancer.
