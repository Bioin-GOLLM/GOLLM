The -168A-G polymorphism has been shown to influence transcription of the MHC2TA 
gene and has been implicated in several inflammatory/autoimmune disorders. 
Attempts to reproduce these findings have been inconclusive. We investigated the 
role of this promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in 440 multiple 
sclerosis (MS), 293 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 74 juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(JIA) patients and 316 healthy controls from Northern Ireland. We also genotyped 
a non-synonymous SNP in exon 11, +1614G/C. There was no significant difference 
in the -168G allele frequencies and carriage rates in the separate RA, JIA, or 
MS collections compared with the control group [odds ratio (OR) = 1.1, 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) = 0.86-1.44; OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.75-1.68; OR = 1.1, 
95% CI = 0.84-1.35, respectively]. Assessment of the common phenotype (chronic 
inflammatory disease; n = 807 vs 316 controls) was negative as well. Carriage of 
+1614C was protective against JIA (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.3-1.0) and showed a 
similar trend in RA and MS (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.5-1.0; OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 
0.6-1.0, respectively). The common phenotype (chronic inflammatory disease) was 
also significant (OR = 0.7, 95% CI = 0.6-1.0).
