The actinomycete strain HSN-02 was isolated from the soil of a mining field in 
the Sandur region, Bellary, Karnataka, India. According to the morphological, 
cultural, physiological, and biochemical characteristics and the 16S rDNA 
sequence analysis, the strain HSN-02 was identified as Amycolatopsis sp. The 
antimicrobial activity strain HSN-02 presented stable and moderate inhibitory 
activity against human pathogens. In pot experiments in the greenhouse, the 
development of Cercospora leaf spot was markedly suppressed by treatment with 
the purified compound from the strain HSN-02, and the control efficacy was 45.04 
Â± 1.30% in Septoria lycopersici-infected tomato plants. A prominent compound was 
obtained from the fermentation broth of the strain HSN-02 using column 
chromatography and HPLC. The chemical structural analyses using UV, FTIR, 
HR-ESI-MS, and NMR confirmed that the compound produced by the strain HSN-02 is 
7-hydroxyflavone. This investigation showed the role which the actinomycete 
strain can play in controlling leaf spots caused by S. lycopersici to reduce 
treatments with chemical fungicides.
