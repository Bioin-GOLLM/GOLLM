Conventional 3D printing technologies typically rely on open-loop, 
calibrate-then-print operation procedures. An alternative approach is adaptive 
3D printing, which is a closed-loop method that combines real-time feedback 
control and direct ink writing of functional materials in order to fabricate 
devices on moving freeform surfaces. Here, it is demonstrated that the changes 
of states in the 3D printing workspace in terms of the geometries and motions of 
target surfaces can be perceived by an integrated robotic system aided by 
computer vision. A hybrid fabrication procedure combining 3D printing of 
electrical connects with automatic pick-and-placing of surface-mounted 
electronic components yields functional electronic devices on a free-moving 
human hand. Using this same approach, cell-laden hydrogels are also printed on 
live mice, creating a model for future studies of wound-healing diseases. This 
adaptive 3D printing method may lead to new forms of smart manufacturing 
technologies for directly printed wearable devices on the body and for advanced 
medical treatments.
