Mutation of the atlastin gene (SPG3A) is responsible for approximately 10% of 
autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP) cases. The goal of 
this study was to identify novel disease causing atlastin mutations. Atlastin 
nucleotide variations were detected by direct sequencing of all 14 exons in 70 
autosomal dominant (AD), 16 single sibship and 14 sporadic spastic paraplegia 
patients. Six mis-sense mutations (four of which were novel) were identified in 
six unrelated AD-HSP kindreds in exons 4, 7 and 8 of the atlastin gene. One 
kindred with a novel mutation showed variability in clinical phenotype and age 
of onset. Mutations are predicted to decrease GTPase activity, cause 
morphological abnormalities of the endoplasmic reticulum and prevent maturation 
of the Golgi complex resulting in impaired vesicle trafficking. Our study 
significantly adds to the spectrum of mutations and clinical phenotype of SPG3A. 
We advocate that all spastin mutation negative AD-HSP kindreds should be 
screened for pathogenic atlastin mutations regardless of age of onset or 
phenotypic complexity.
