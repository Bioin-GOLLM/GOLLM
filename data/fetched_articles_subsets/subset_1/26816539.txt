BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring kinase-domain mutations 
in epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) has been observed to be sensitive to 
ionizing radiation (IR). We explore Rad51-dependent homologous recombination 
(HR) DNA repair in regulating radiosensitivity in two NSCLC cell lines with 
different EGFR mutation status.
METHODS: NSCLC cell lines, wild-type EGFR A549 and mutant EGFR H820 with an 
in-frame deletion in exon 19 of EGFR (ΔE746-E750), were cultured. 
Radiosensitivity was estimated by colony forming assay. Rad51 expression was 
evaluated by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction and Western-blot. 
Lentiviral small hairpin ribonucleic acid-Rad51 and ΔE746-E750 deletion mutant 
EGFR were constructed and transfected into cells. Flowcytometry assay was used 
to analyze DNA double strand breaks, cell cycle alterations, and apoptosis.
RESULTS: A549 had a higher survival factor (SF)2 (0.66 vs. 0.44) and lower α/β 
value (4.07 vs. 9.01). Compared with the A549 cell, the H820 cell exhibited 
defective arrest in the S-phase, a higher rate of G2/M accumulation, early 
apoptosis, and residual γ-H2AX. Downregulated Rad51 expression decreased SF2 
(0.42 vs. 0.31) and increased the α/β ratio (7.51 vs. 10.5), G2/M accumulation, 
early apoptosis, and γ-H2AX in two cell lines. H820 had a low IR-induced Rad51 
expression and nuclear translocation. Exogenous expression of the ΔE746-E750 
deletion mutant EGFR caused the A549 cell to become more radiosensitive.
CONCLUSIONS: An EGFR mutated NSCLC cell line is sensitive to IR , which is 
correlated with reduced IR-induced Rad51 expression and nuclear translocation. 
The signaling pathway of EGFR maintaining Rad51 protein levels maybe a novel 
lung cancer therapeutic target to overcome radioresistance.
