Astroglia are a diverse group of cells in the central nervous system. They are 
of the ectodermal, neuroepithelial origin and vary in morphology and function, 
yet, they can be collectively defined as cells having principle function to 
maintain homeostasis of the central nervous system at all levels of 
organisation, including homeostasis of ions, pH and neurotransmitters; supplying 
neurones with metabolic substrates; supporting oligodendrocytes and axons; 
regulating synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and formation and maintenance of the 
blood-brain barrier; contributing to operation of the glymphatic system; and 
regulation of systemic homeostasis being central chemosensors for oxygen, CO2 
and Na+. Their basic physiological features show a lack of electrical 
excitability (inapt to produce action potentials), but display instead a rather 
active excitability based on variations in cytosolic concentrations of Ca2+ and 
Na+. It is expression of neurotransmitter receptors, pumps and transporters at 
their plasmalemma, along with transports on the endoplasmic reticulum and 
mitochondria that exquisitely regulate the cytosolic levels of these ions, the 
fluctuation of which underlies most, if not all, astroglial homeostatic 
functions.
