For several histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs), RNA binding has been 
already shown to be a functionally relevant feature, but detailed information on 
the RNA interactome of these proteins is not always known. Of the six human KMT2 
proteins responsible for the methylation of the H3K4 residue, two-SETD1A and 
SETD1B-contain RNA recognition domains (RRMs). Here we investigated the RNA 
binding capacity of SETD1A and identified a broad range of interacting RNAs 
within HEK293T cells. Our analysis revealed that similar to yeast Set1, SETD1A 
is also capable of binding several coding and non-coding RNAs, including RNA 
species related to RNA processing. We also show direct RNA binding activity of 
the individual RRM domain in vitro, which is in contrast with the RRM domain 
found in yeast Set1. Structural modeling revealed important details on the 
possible RNA recognition mode of SETD1A and highlighted some fundamental 
differences between SETD1A and Set1, explaining the differences in the RNA 
binding capacity of their respective RRMs.
