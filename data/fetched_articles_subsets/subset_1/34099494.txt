Leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors 4, 5, and 6 
(LGR4/5/6) play critical roles in development and cancer. The widely accepted 
mechanism is that these proteins, together with their R-spondin ligands, 
stabilize Wnt receptors, thus potentiating Wnt signaling. Here we show that LGR4 
enhanced breast cancer cell metastasis even when Wnt signaling was deactivated 
pharmacologically or genetically. Furthermore, LGR4 mutants that cannot 
potentiate Wnt signaling nevertheless promoted breast cancer cell migration and 
invasion in vitro and breast cancer metastasis in vivo. Multiomic screening 
identified EGFR as a crucial mediator of LGR4 activity in cancer progression. 
Mechanistically, LGR4 interacted with EGFR and blocked EGFR ubiquitination and 
degradation, resulting in persistent EGFR activation. Together, these data 
uncover a Wnt-independent LGR4-EGFR signaling axis with broad implications for 
cancer progression and targeted therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates a 
Wnt-independent mechanism by which LGR4 promotes cancer metastasis.See related 
commentary by Stevens and Williams, p. 4397.
