PURPOSE: To determine the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
of defensin 1B and toll-like receptor 4 with contact lens keratitis 
susceptibility and severity, and to understand the factors that influence study 
participation.
DESIGN: Retrospective, case-control study.
PARTICIPANTS: Ninety cases of keratitis and 185 controls recruited from studies 
conducted at Moorfields Eye Hospital and throughout Australia from 2003 to 2005 
were analyzed for genetic associations. The reasons for participation of a 
subset of 146 participants from 1 site were also investigated.
METHODS: Buccal swab samples were collected on Whatman FTA cards and mailed by 
post for analysis. DEFB1 (rs1799946, -52, rs1800972, -44, and rs11362, -20) and 
TLR4 (rs4986790, D299G) SNPs were screened by pyrosequencing and analyzed using 
a regression model for susceptibility (sterile, microbial keratitis [MK], 
controls) and severity. Study participation was investigated for age, gender, 
condition, and phone follow-up also using regression analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative risk of developing contact lens-related 
keratitis and more severe forms of the disease based on genetic profiles.
RESULTS: Carriers of risk alleles of DEFB1 -52 and -20 showed a trend toward 
increased susceptibility to keratitis (-52: odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.99-2.11; P = 0.051; -20: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 
0.95-1.98; P = 0.088). A DEFB1 promoter haplotype (G-G-A) had a tendency toward 
decreased susceptibility of MK (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45-1.03; P = 0.062) and 
reduced severity (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.30-1.07; P = 0.066). The TLR4 D299G was 
not associated with type and severity of keratitis. Older age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 
1.05-1.08) and follow-up phone call (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.5) were independent 
predictors of study participation.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in DEFB1 that may lead to decreased protein 
expression of hBD-1 exhibits a tendency toward increased susceptibility and 
severity of contact lens-related keratitis. Investigation of these and other hBD 
genes that play important roles in animal models in a larger sample size is 
warranted. The approach of requesting samples from retrospective case series was 
generally feasible, although significant resources, including repeat phone 
calls, are required. More targeted strategies to recruit younger individuals to 
participate in genetic studies may be useful.
