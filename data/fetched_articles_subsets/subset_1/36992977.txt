Maternal nutrition during gestation has important effects on gene 
expression-mediated metabolic programming in offspring. To evaluate the effect 
of a protein-restricted maternal diet during gestation, pancreatic islets from 
male progeny of Wistar rats were studied at postnatal days (PND) 36 (juveniles) 
and 90 (young adults). The expression of key genes involved in β-cell function 
and the DNA methylation pattern of the regulatory regions of two such genes, 
Pdx1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1) and MafA (musculoaponeurotic 
fibrosarcoma oncogene family, protein A), were investigated. Gene expression 
analysis in the pancreatic islets of restricted offspring showed significant 
differences compared with the control group at PND 36 (P < 0.05). The insulin 1 
and 2 (Ins1 and Ins2), Glut2 (glucose transporter 2), Pdx1, MafA, and Atf2 
(activating transcription factor 2), genes were upregulated, while glucokinase 
(Gck) and NeuroD1 (neuronal differentiation 1) were downregulated. Additionally, 
we studied whether the gene expression differences in Pdx1 and MafA between 
control and restricted offspring were associated with differential DNA 
methylation status in their regulatory regions. A decrease in the DNA 
methylation levels was found in the 5' flanking region between nucleotides -8118 
to -7750 of the MafA regulatory region in restricted offspring compared with 
control pancreatic islets. In conclusion, low protein availability during 
gestation causes the upregulation of MafA gene expression in pancreatic β-cells 
in the male juvenile offspring at least in part through DNA hypomethylation. 
This process may contribute to developmental dysregulation of β-cell function 
and influence the long-term health of the offspring.
