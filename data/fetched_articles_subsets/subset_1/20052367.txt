Cystinuria is an inherited renal and intestinal disease characterized by 
defective amino acids reabsorption and cystine urolithiasis. It is unusually 
associated with neurologic symptoms. Mutations in two genes, SLC3A1 and SLC7A9, 
have been identified in cystinuric patients. This report presents a 13-yr-old 
boy with cystinuria who manifested difficulty in walking, ataxia, and mental 
retardation. Somatosensory evoked potential of posterior tibial nerve 
stimulation showed the central conduction dysfunction through the posterior 
column of spinal cord. He was diagnosed non-type I cystinuria by urinary amino 
acid analysis and oral cystine loading test. We screened him and his family for 
gene mutation by direct sequencing of SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes. In this patient, 
we identified new missence mutation G173R in SLC7A9 gene.
