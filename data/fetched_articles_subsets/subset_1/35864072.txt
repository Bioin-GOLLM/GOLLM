In recent years, the field of malaria research has made substantial progress in 
the areas of antimalarial drug resistance and discovery. These efforts are 
essential to combatting the devastating impact of malaria, which, in 2020, 
resulted in an estimated 241 million cases and 627 000 deaths. Recent advances 
in this area were presented at a Keystone Symposium entitled ‘Malaria: 
Confronting Challenges from Drug Discovery to Treatment’, held in person in 
Breckenridge, Colorado, in April 2022. Herein, we present a summary of the 
proceedings of this vibrant scientific exchange, which brought together a superb 
group of faculty, postdocs, and students from around the globe.
