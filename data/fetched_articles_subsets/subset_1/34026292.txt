INTRODUCTION: A population-specific genomic reference is important for research 
and clinical practice, yet it remains unavailable for Han Chinese (HC) in 
Taiwan.
OBJECTIVES: We report the first whole genome sequencing (WGS) database of HC 
(1000 Taiwanese genome (1KTW-WGS)) and demonstrate several applications to 
cardiovascular medicine.
METHODS: Whole genomes of 997 HC were sequenced to at least 30X depth. A total 
of 20,117 relatively healthy HC individuals were genotyped using a customized 
Axiom GWAS array. We performed a genome-wide genotype imputation technique using 
IMPUTE2.
RESULTS: We identified 26.7 million single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 4.2 
million insertions-deletions. Of the SNVs, 16.1% were novel relative to dbSNP 
(build 152), and 34.2% were novel relative to gnomAD. A total of 18,450 healthy 
HC individuals were genotyped using a customized Genome-Wide Association Study 
(GWAS) array. We identified hypertension-associated variants and developed a 
hypertension prediction model based on the correlation between the WGS data and 
GWAS data (combined clinical and genetic models, AUC 0.887), and also identified 
3 novel hyperlipidemia-associated variants. Each individual carried an average 
of 16.42 (SD = 3.72) disease-causing variants. Additionally, we established an 
online SCN5A (an important cardiac gene) database that can be used to explore 
racial differences. Finally, pharmacogenetics studies identified HC 
population-specific SNVs in genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC1) involved in drug 
metabolism and blood clotting.
CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates the benefits of constructing a 
population-specific genomic reference database for precision medicine.
