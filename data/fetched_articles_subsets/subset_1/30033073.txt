Mutations in TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) have been linked to amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis. Some TBK1 variants are nonsense and are predicted to cause 
disease through haploinsufficiency; however, many other mutations are missense 
with unknown functional effects. We exome sequenced 699 familial amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis patients and identified 16 TBK1 novel or extremely rare 
protein-changing variants. We characterized a subset of these: p.G217R, p.R357X, 
and p.C471Y. Here, we show that the p.R357X and p.G217R both abolish the ability 
of TBK1 to phosphorylate 2 of its kinase targets, IRF3 and optineurin, and to 
undergo phosphorylation. They both inhibit binding to optineurin and the 
p.G217R, within the TBK1 kinase domain, reduces homodimerization, essential for 
TBK1 activation and function. Finally, we show that the proportion of TBK1 that 
is active (phosphorylated) is reduced in 5 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived 
from patients harboring heterozygous missense or in-frame deletion TBK1 
mutations. We conclude that missense mutations in functional domains of TBK1 
impair the binding and phosphorylation of its normal targets, implicating a 
common loss of function mechanism, analogous to truncation mutations.
