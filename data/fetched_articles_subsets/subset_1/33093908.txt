The identified mutations in the G elongation factor mitochondrial 1 (GFM1) gene 
have been associated with heterogeneous clinical features of an early-onset 
mitochondrial disease in only 25 families. The present study reports the case of 
two siblings with a novel GFM1 variant and their clinical and laboratory 
presentations, which included progressive hepatic encephalopathy, failure to 
thrive and persistent lactic acidemia. Both histological changes and diminished 
expression of the GFM1 protein were observed in the liver and kidney tissues of 
the index patient. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing technologies were used to 
diagnose the index patient with defective GFM1 using amniocentesis at 32 weeks' 
gestation. Heterozygous mutations in the GFM1 gene were identified in both 
siblings: A novel mutation, C1576T in exon 13 inherited from their asymptomatic 
mother, resulting in a premature stop codon at amino acid position 526 and the 
previously reported G688A mutation on the boundary between exon 5 and intron 
5-6, inherited from their asymptomatic father. In conclusion, the present study 
reports two siblings carrying a novel GFM1 variant with a rare fatal 
mitochondrial disease.
