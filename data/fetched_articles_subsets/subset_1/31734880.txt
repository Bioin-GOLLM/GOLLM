A growing body of evidence indicates that pathological forms of amyloid beta 
(Aβ) peptide contribute to neuronal degeneration and synaptic loss in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the impact of exogenous 
Aβ1-42 oligomers (AβO) and endogenously liberated Aβ peptides on transcription 
of genes for anti-oxidative and mitochondria-related proteins in cell lines 
(neuronal SH-SY5Y and microglial BV2) and in brain cortex of transgenic AD 
(Tg-AD) mice, respectively. Our results demonstrated significant AβO-evoked 
changes in transcription of genes in SH-SY5Y cells, where AβO enhanced 
expression of Sod1, Cat, mt-Nd1, Bcl2, and attenuated Sirt5, Sod2 and Sdha. In 
BV2 line, AβO increased the level of mRNA for Sod2, Dnm1l, Bcl2, and decreased 
for Gpx4, Sirt1, Sirt3, mt-Nd1, Sdha and Mfn2. Then, AβO enhanced free radicals 
level and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential only in SH-SY5Y cells, but 
reduced viability of both cell types. Inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 
and activator of sirtuin-1 more efficiently enhanced viability of SH-SY5Y than 
BV2 affected by AβO. Analysis of brain cortex of Tg-AD mice confirmed 
significant downregulation of Sirt1, Mfn1 and mt-Nd1 and upregulation of Dnm1l. 
In human AD brain, changes of microRNA pattern (miRNA-9, miRNA-34a, miRNA-146a 
and miRNA-155) seem to be responsible for decrease in Sirt1 expression. Overall, 
our results demonstrated a diverse response of neuronal and microglial cells to 
AβO toxicity. Alterations of genes encoding Sirt1, Mfn1 and Drp1 in an 
experimental model of AD suggest that modulation of mitochondria dynamics and 
Sirt1, including miRNA strategy, may be crucial for improvement of AD therapy.
