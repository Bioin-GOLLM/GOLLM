Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. It has 
two main pathological hallmarks: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. 
The APOE ε4 allele has been recognized as the strongest genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in several populations worldwide, yet the 
risk varies by region and ethnicity. The aims of this study were to describe 
APOE allele and genotype frequencies and examine the relationship between the 
APOE ε4 allele and LOAD risk in an Ecuadorian Mestizo population. We carried out 
a case-control study comprising 56 individuals clinically diagnosed with 
probable AD (≥65 years of age) and 58 unrelated healthy control subjects (≥65 
years of age). Genotyping was performed using the real-time PCR method. Our data 
showed that allelic and genotypic frequencies follow the trends observed in most 
worldwide populations. We also found a high-risk association between APOE ε4 
allele carriers and LOAD (OR = 7.286; 95% CI = 2.824-18.799; p < 0.001). 
Therefore, we concluded that APOE ε4 must be considered an important genetic 
risk factor for LOAD in the Ecuadorian Mestizo population. Additionally, we 
suggest that in mixed populations the effects of admixture and ethnic identity 
should be differentiated when evaluating genetic contributions to Alzheimer's 
disease risk.
