Recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA), in 
which the plasmin-sensitive peptide bond Lys158-Ile159 is destroyed by 
site-specific mutagenesis of Lys158 to Glu (rscu-PA-Glu158), is quantitatively 
converted to two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rtcu-PA-Glu158) by 
treatment with endoproteinase Glu-C (Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase). The 
catalytic efficiency (k2/Km) of rscu-PA-Glu158 for the activation of plasminogen 
is 20 times lower (0.0001 microM-1 s-1) than that of rscu-PA (0.002 microM-1 
s-1). In contrast, rtcu-PA-Glu158 has very similar properties to rtcu-PA 
obtained by digestion of rscu-PA with plasmin, including binding to 
benzamidine-Sepharose, catalytic efficiency for the activation of plasminogen 
(0.035 microM-1 s-1 versus 0.046 microM-1 s-1) and fibrinolytic activity in an 
in vitro plasma clot lysis system. It is concluded that the amino acid in 
position 158 is a main determinant of the functional properties of single-chain 
urokinase-type plasminogen activator but not of the two-chain form.
