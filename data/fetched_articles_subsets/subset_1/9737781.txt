Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) deficiency is a rare immunodeficiency 
disease involving a T-lymphocyte-dysfunction that is fatal unless bone marrow 
transplantation is successful. In this study we undertook genetic analysis of a 
patient with PNP deficiency. Sequencing of the PNP gene, which is located on 
chromosome 14ql3, of the patient led to the identification of three point 
mutations in exon 2 at amino acid positions 20 (His, silent mutation), 24 
(Arg-->termination codon) and 51 (Ser-->Gly). Intrafamilial sequence analysis of 
exon 2 revealed that both parents were heterozygous for the Arg24 and 
termination codon 24 alleles. Two of their three children had inherited 
different homozygous alleles, termination codon 24 for the patient, and Arg24 
for his healthy sibling. Transcriptional termination was suggested as the 
mechanism giving rise to the disorder in this case. A lack of PNP protein was 
also confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the patient's hemolysate. This could be 
the first report providing evidence of autosomal recessive inheritance in PNP 
deficiency by sequence-based analysis.
