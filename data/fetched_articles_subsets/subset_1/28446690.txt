As part of the global effort toward malaria eradication, phenotypic whole-cell 
screening revealed the 2-aminopyridine class of small molecules as a good 
starting point to develop new antimalarial drugs. Stemming from this series, we 
found that the derivative, MMV390048, lacked cross-resistance with current drugs 
used to treat malaria. This compound was efficacious against all Plasmodium life 
cycle stages, apart from late hypnozoites in the liver. Efficacy was shown in 
the humanized Plasmodium falciparum mouse model, and modest reductions in 
mouse-to-mouse transmission were achieved in the Plasmodium berghei mouse model. 
Experiments in monkeys revealed the ability of MMV390048 to be used for full 
chemoprotection. Although MMV390048 was not able to eliminate liver hypnozoites, 
it delayed relapse in a Plasmodium cynomolgi monkey model. Both genomic and 
chemoproteomic studies identified a kinase of the Plasmodium parasite, 
phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, as the molecular target of MMV390048. The ability 
of MMV390048 to block all life cycle stages of the malaria parasite suggests 
that this compound should be further developed and may contribute to malaria 
control and eradication as part of a single-dose combination treatment.
