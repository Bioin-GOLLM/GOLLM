Many antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and 
interfering with protein biosynthesis. Macrolides represent one of the most 
successful classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. The main clinically 
relevant mechanism of resistance to macrolides is dimethylation of the 23S rRNA 
nucleotide A2058, located in the drug-binding site, a reaction catalyzed by 
Erm-type rRNA methyltransferases. Here, we present the crystal structure of the 
Erm-dimethylated 70S ribosome at 2.4 Å resolution, together with the structures 
of unmethylated 70S ribosome functional complexes alone or in combination with 
macrolides. Altogether, our structural data do not support previous models and, 
instead, suggest a principally new explanation of how A2058 dimethylation 
confers resistance to macrolides. Moreover, high-resolution structures of two 
macrolide antibiotics bound to the unmodified ribosome reveal a previously 
unknown role of the desosamine moiety in drug binding, laying a foundation for 
the rational knowledge-based design of macrolides that can overcome Erm-mediated 
resistance.
