The ultrarare hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver cancer. HB 
risk is related to a few rare syndromes, and the molecular bases remain elusive 
for most cases. We investigated the burden of rare damaging germline variants in 
30 Brazilian patients with HB and the presence of additional clinical signs. A 
high frequency of prematurity (20%) and birth defects (37%), especially 
craniofacial (17%, including craniosynostosis) and kidney (7%) anomalies, was 
observed. Putative pathogenic or likely pathogenic monoallelic germline variants 
mapped to 10 cancer predisposition genes (CPGs: APC, CHEK2, DROSHA, ERCC5, FAH, 
MSH2, MUTYH, RPS19, TGFBR2 and VHL) were detected in 33% of the patients, only 
40% of them with a family history of cancer. These findings showed a 
predominance of CPGs with a known link to gastrointestinal/colorectal and renal 
cancer risk. A remarkable feature was an enrichment of rare damaging variants 
affecting different classes of DNA repair genes, particularly those known as 
Fanconi anemia genes. Moreover, several potentially deleterious variants mapped 
to genes impacting liver functions were disclosed. To our knowledge, this is the 
largest assessment of rare germline variants in HB patients to date, 
contributing to elucidate the genetic architecture of HB risk.
