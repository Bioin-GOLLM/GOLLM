To determine the risk factors for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and construct a 
risk model for predicting HF in patients with DCM, We enrolled a total of 2122 
patients, excluding those who did not meet the requirements. A total of 913 
patients were included in the analysis (611 males and 302 females) from October 
2012 to May 2020, and data on demographic characteristics, blood biochemical 
markers, and cardiac ultrasound results were collected. Patients were strictly 
screened for DCM based on the diagnostic criteria. First, these patients were 
evaluated using propensity score matching (PSM). Next, unconditional logistic 
regression was used to assess HF risk. Furthermore, receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to determine diagnostic 
efficiency, and a nomogram was developed to predict HF. Finally, the 
Kaplan‒Meier survival curve was plotted. Of the initial 2122 patients, the 
ejection fraction (EF) in males was worse. We included 913 patients after the 
final DCM diagnosis. The results showed that the levels of NT-proBNP, WBC, PLT, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and 
the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 
CRP/lymphocyte ratio (CLR) were higher in males than in females 
(P < 0.001-0.009). The nomogram showed that factors such as sex, WBC, 
neutrophils, PLR, and CLR could predict the risk of worsening cardiac function 
in patients with DCM before and after PSM (P < 0.05). The ROC curve showed that 
CLR with an 85.6% area demonstrated higher diagnostic efficacy than the NLR 
(77.0%) and PLR (76.6%, P < 0.05). Survival analysis showed a higher mortality 
risk in females with higher CLR levels (P < 0.001-0.009). However, high CLR 
levels indicated a higher mortality risk (P < 0.001) compared to sex. Male EF is 
lower in DCM patients. CLR could predict the risk of declined cardiac function 
in patients with DCM. The mortality in females with higher CLR levels was 
highest; however, the exact mechanism should be investigated.
