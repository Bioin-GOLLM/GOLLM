In the title mol-ecule, C(19)H(19)ClN(4)OS, the 1,2,4-triazole ring forms 
dihedral angles of 86.0 (2) and 65.6 (2)° with the phenyl and chloro-phenyl 
rings, respectively. In the crystal, inter-molecular N-H⋯S and N-H⋯O hydrogen 
bonds link mol-ecules into centrosymmetric dimers, which are further linked into 
chains in [001] via weak C-H⋯π inter-actions.
