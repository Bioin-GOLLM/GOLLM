Mutations in TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal paralytic 
disease characterized by degeneration and premature death of motor neurons. The 
contribution of mutant TDP-43-mediated damage within motor neurons was evaluated 
using mice expressing a conditional allele of an ALS-causing TDP-43 mutant 
(Q331K) whose broad expression throughout the central nervous system mimics 
endogenous TDP-43. TDP-43Q331K mice develop age- and mutant-dependent motor 
deficits from degeneration and death of motor neurons. Cre-recombinase-mediated 
excision of the TDP-43Q331K gene from motor neurons is shown to delay onset of 
motor symptoms and appearance of TDP-43-mediated aberrant nuclear morphology, 
and abrogate subsequent death of motor neurons. However, reduction of mutant 
TDP-43 selectively in motor neurons did not prevent age-dependent degeneration 
of axons and neuromuscular junction loss, nor did it attenuate astrogliosis or 
microgliosis. Thus, disease mechanism is non-cell autonomous with mutant TDP-43 
expressed in motor neurons determining disease onset but progression defined by 
mutant acting within other cell types.
