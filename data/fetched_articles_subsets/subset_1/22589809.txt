The distorted octa-hedral geometry about the Sn(IV) atom in the title compound, 
[Sn(C(6)H(5))(2)(C(14)H(19)N(4)S)Cl], is defined by the N,N,S-tridentate Schiff 
base ligand, two mutually trans ipso-C atoms of the Sn-bound phenyl groups, and 
the Cl atom which is trans to the azo N atom. The two five-membered chelate 
rings and pyridyl ring are almost coplanar with the dihedral angle between the 
outer five-membered chelate and pyridine rings being 5.39 (8)°. Centrosymmetric 
dimers feature in the crystal packing mediated by N-H⋯S hydrogen bonds, leading 
to eight-membered {⋯HNCS}(2) synthons. The dimeric aggregates are connected into 
a three-dimensional architecture by C-H⋯Cl and C-H⋯π inter-actions, as well as 
π-π inter-actions occurring between centrosymmetrically related pyridine rings 
[centroid-centroid distance = 3.6322 (13) Å].
