BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis imperfecta type I (OI-I) is a rare genetic disorder 
characterized by skeletal deformity, bone fragility, blue sclerae, 
dentinogenesis imperfecta, and hearing loss. The current study aimed to confirm 
the clinical diagnosis and genetic cause of OI-I in a four-generation Chinese 
family.
METHODS: Clinical investigation and pedigree analysis were conducted to 
characterize the phenotypic manifestations of a Chinese family with OI-I. 
Follow-up audiometry and imaging tests were used to evaluate the postoperative 
outcomes of stapes surgery in the proband with otosclerosis. Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the pathogenic gene 
variants and for cosegregating analysis.
RESULTS: We described in detail the clinical features of the collected family 
with autosomal dominant OI-I, and firstly identified a pathogenic splicing 
variant (c.2344-1G>T) in intron 33 of COL1A1 in a Chinese family. The molecular 
analysis suggested that the mutation might cause splice site changes that result 
in a loss of gene function. The proband, who suffered from otosclerosis and 
presented two-side middle-severe conductive hearing loss, benefitted 
significantly from successive bilateral middle ear surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of OI-I in a Chinese family was established by 
clinical and genetic investigation. A heterozygous pathogenic splicing variant 
in COL1A1 was directly responsible for the bone fragility and hearing loss of 
this family. Otosclerosis surgery should be suggested to rehabilitate conductive 
hearing impairment in OI patients.
