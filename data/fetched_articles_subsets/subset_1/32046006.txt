Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases 
and a widespread form of dementia. Aggregated forms of the amyloid β-peptide 
(Aβ) are identified as a toxic species responsible for neuronal damage in AD. 
Extensive research has been conducted to reveal the aggregation mechanism of Aβ. 
However, the structure of pathological aggregates and the mechanism of 
aggregation are not well understood. Recently, experimental studies have 
confirmed that the α-sheet structure in Aβ drives aggregation and toxicity in 
AD. However, how the α-sheet structure is formed in Aβ and how it contributes to 
Aβ aggregation remains elusive. In the present study, molecular dynamics 
simulations suggest that Aβ adopts the α-strand conformation by peptide-plane 
flipping. Multiple α-strands interact through hydrogen bonding to form α-sheets. 
This structure acts as a nucleus that initiates and promotes aggregation and 
fibrillation of Aβ. Our findings are supported by previous experimental as well 
as theoretical studies. This study provides valuable structural insights for the 
design of anti-AD drugs exploiting the α-strand/α-sheet structure.
