Cryo-electron microscopy has become an essential tool to understand structure 
and function of biological samples. Especially for pathogens, such as 
disease-causing bacteria and viruses, insights gained by cryo-EM can aid in 
developing cures. However, due to the biosafety restrictions of pathogens, 
samples are often treated by chemical fixation to render the pathogen inert, 
affecting the ultrastructure of the sample. Alternatively, researchers use in 
vitro or ex vivo models, which are non-pathogenic but lack the complexity of the 
pathogen of interest. Here we show that ultraviolet-C (UVC) radiation applied at 
cryogenic temperatures can be used to eliminate or dramatically reduce the 
infectivity of Vibrio cholerae and the bacterial virus, the ICP1 bacteriophage. 
We show no discernable structural impact of this treatment of either sample 
using two cryo-EM methods: cryo-electron tomography followed by sub-tomogram 
averaging, and single particle analysis (SPA). Additionally, we applied the UVC 
irradiation to the protein apoferritin (ApoF), which is a widely used test 
sample for high-resolution SPA studies. The UVC-treated ApoF sample resulted in 
a 2.1 Å structure indistinguishable from an untreated published map. This 
research demonstrates that UVC treatment is an effective and inexpensive 
addition to the cryo-EM sample preparation toolbox.
