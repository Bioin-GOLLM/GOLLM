Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) is involved in multiple 
physiological and pathological processes. Several genetic variants of FGFR4 have 
been shown to be associated with tumor progression in many cancers. However, its 
association, such as genetic variants and expression levels, with lung cancer is 
controversial. The present study examined the relationship between four 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2011077 T/C, rs351855 G/A, rs7708357 
G/A, and rs1966265 A/G) of FGFR4 and the risk of lung adenocarcinoma with the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status in a Taiwanese cohort. 
The results demonstrated that FGFR4 rs2011077 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.348, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 0.136-0.891, p = 0.024), and rs351855 (OR = 0.296, 
95% CI = 0.116-0.751, p = 0.008) showed an inverse association with distant 
metastasis in wild-type EGFR lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, a database 
analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that the higher FGFR4 expression 
level was correlated with poor survival rates in wild-type EGFR lung 
adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, the data suggest that FGFR4 SNPs may help in 
identifying patient subgroups at low-risk for tumor metastasis, among carriers 
of lung adenocarcinoma bearing wild-type EGFR.
