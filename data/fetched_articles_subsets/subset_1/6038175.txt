Hemoglobin Gun Hill: deletion of five amino acid residues and impaired 
heme-globin binding.

Bradley TB Jr, Wohl RC, Rieder RF.

Hemoglobin Gun Hill, a new variant of adult hemoglobin, was found in a Caucasian 
and one of his three daughters. The abnormal hemoglobin had only half of the 
expected number of heme groups. Five amino acid residues appeared to be missing 
from the beta-globin chains. These residues occur in linear sequence in normal 
beta-chains in a region involved in heme-globin binding. A deletion of five 
amino acids in the beta-chains of hemoglobin Gun Hill is postulated. The most 
likely mechanism for the origin of such a hemoglobin variant would appear to be 
unequal crossing-over during meiosis.
