Genetic variation in seed protein composition, seed protein gene expression and 
predictions of seed protein physiochemical properties were documented in C. 
sativa and other Camelina species. Seed protein diversity was examined in six 
Camelina species (C. hispida, C. laxa, C. microcarpa, C. neglecta, C. rumelica 
and C. sativa). Differences were observed in seed protein electrophoretic 
profiles, total seed protein content and amino acid composition between the 
species. Genes encoding major seed proteins (cruciferins, napins, oleosins and 
vicilins) were catalogued for C. sativa and RNA-Seq analysis established the 
expression patterns of these and other genes in developing seed from anthesis 
through to maturation. Examination of 187 C. sativa accessions revealed limited 
variation in seed protein electrophoretic profiles, though sufficient to group 
the majority into classes based on high MW protein profiles corresponding to the 
cruciferin region. C. sativa possessed four distinct types of cruciferins, named 
CsCRA, CsCRB, CsCRC and CsCRD, which corresponded to orthologues in Arabidopsis 
thaliana with members of each type encoded by homeologous genes on the three C. 
sativa sub-genomes. Total protein content and amino acid composition varied only 
slightly; however, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CsCRA and CsCRB genes 
contributed > 95% of the cruciferin transcripts in most lines, whereas CsCRC 
genes were the most highly expressed cruciferin genes in others, including the 
type cultivar DH55. This was confirmed by proteomics analyses. Cruciferin is the 
most abundant seed protein and contributes the most to functionality. Modelling 
of the C. sativa cruciferins indicated that each type possesses different 
physiochemical attributes that were predicted to impart unique functional 
properties. As such, opportunities exist to create C. sativa cultivars with seed 
protein profiles tailored to specific technical applications.
