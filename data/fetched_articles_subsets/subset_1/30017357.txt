It is unknown what occurs if both mitochondrial division and fusion are 
completely blocked. Here, we introduced mitochondrial stasis by deleting two 
dynamin-related GTPases for division (Drp1) and fusion (Opa1) in livers. 
Mitochondrial stasis rescues liver damage and hypotrophy caused by the single 
knockout (KO). At the cellular level, mitochondrial stasis re-establishes 
mitochondrial size and rescues mitophagy defects caused by division deficiency. 
Using Drp1KO livers, we found that the autophagy adaptor protein 
p62/sequestosome-1-which is thought to function downstream of 
ubiquitination-promotes mitochondrial ubiquitination. p62 recruits two subunits 
of a cullin-RING ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, Keap1 and Rbx1, to mitochondria. 
Resembling Drp1KO, diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty livers enlarge mitochondria 
and accumulate mitophagy intermediates. Resembling Drp1Opa1KO, Opa1KO rescues 
liver damage in this disease model. Our data provide a new concept that 
mitochondrial stasis leads the spatial dimension of mitochondria to a stationary 
equilibrium and a new mechanism for mitochondrial ubiquitination in mitophagy.
