Replication Protein A (RPA) is a broadly conserved complex comprised of the 
RPA1, 2 and 3 subunits. RPA protects the exposed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 
during DNA replication and repair. Using structural modeling, we discover an 
inhibitor, JC-229, that targets RPA1 in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative 
parasite of African trypanosomiasis. The inhibitor is highly toxic to T. brucei 
cells, while mildly toxic to human cells. JC-229 treatment mimics the effects of 
TbRPA1 depletion, including DNA replication inhibition and DNA damage 
accumulation. In-vitro ssDNA-binding assays demonstrate that JC-229 inhibits the 
activity of TbRPA1, but not the human ortholog. Indeed, despite the high 
sequence identity with T. cruzi and Leishmania RPA1, JC-229 only impacts the 
ssDNA-binding activity of TbRPA1. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms that the 
DNA-Binding Domain A (DBD-A) in TbRPA1 contains a JC-229 binding pocket. Residue 
Serine 105 determines specific binding and inhibition of TbRPA1 but not T. cruzi 
and Leishmania RPA1. Our data suggest a path toward developing and testing 
highly specific inhibitors for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis.
