3-Hydroxyisobutyryl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydrolase deficiency (HIBCHD; MIM: #250620) 
is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by a defect in 
the HIBCH enzyme, resulting in a deficiency of the conversion of 
3-hydroxy-isobutyryl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-isobutyric acid, a critical step in valine 
catabolism. This neurodegenerative disease of infancy is associated with 
hypotonia, developmental delay, cerebral atrophy and lesions in the basal 
ganglia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we describe two 
unrelated patients with infantile-onset progressive neurodegenerative disease 
and mutations in HIBCH identified using whole exome sequencing (WES). In Case 1, 
WES revealed a novel homozygous variant in the HIBCH gene: c.808A>G 
(p.Ser270Gly). In Case 2, a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the HIBCH 
gene is described: c.808A>G (p.Ser270Gly) and c.173A>G (p. Asn58Ser). Parent 
analysis revealed that c.808A>G (p.Ser270Gly) was inherited from the father and 
c.173A>G (p. Asn58Ser) from the mother. These novel mutations were predicted as 
a disease-causing mutation. Plasma acylcarnitine analysis was normal in both 
patients. Physical examination showed similar features, such as axial hypotonia 
and spastic hypertonia in the legs. The first patient presented with 
difficult-to-treat seizures, while the second patient has not yet experienced 
documented seizures. In conclusion, our findings would widen the mutation 
spectrum of HIBCH deficiency and the phenotypic spectrum of the disease. The 
potential genotype-phenotype correlation would be profitable for the correct 
diagnosis, treatment and integral management of patients with HIBCH deficiency.
