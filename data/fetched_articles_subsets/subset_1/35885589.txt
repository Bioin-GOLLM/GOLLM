Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer mortality 
worldwide and the most prevalent cancer in Taiwan. The matrix metalloproteinase 
(MMP)-11 is a proteolytic enzyme of the MMP family which is involved in 
extracellular matrix degradation and tissue remodeling. In this study, we 
focused on the associations of MMP-11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
with CRC susceptibility and clinicopathological characteristics. The MMP-11 SNPs 
rs131451, rs738791, rs2267029, rs738792, and rs28382575 in 479 controls and 479 
patients with CRC were analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction. We 
found that the MMP-11 SNP rs738792 "TC + CC" genotype was significantly 
associated with perineural invasion in colon cancer patients after controlling 
for clinical parameters [OR (95% CI) = 1.783 (1.074-2.960); p = 0.025]. The 
MMP-11 rs131451 "TC + CC" genotypic variants were correlated with greater tumor 
T status [OR (95% CI):1.254 (1.025-1.534); p = 0.028] and perineural invasion 
[OR (95% CI):1.773 (1.027-3.062); p = 0.040) in male CRC patients. Furthermore, 
analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that MMP-11 levels were 
upregulated in colorectal carcinoma tissue compared with normal tissues and were 
correlated with advanced stage, larger tumor sizes, and lymph node metastasis. 
Moreover, the data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database exhibited 
that the MMP-11 rs738792 "CC" and "CT" genotypic variants have higher MMP-11 
expression than the "TT" genotype. In conclusion, our results have demonstrated 
that the MMP-11 SNPs rs738792 and rs131451 may have potential to provide 
biomarkers to evaluate CRC disease progression, and the MMP-11 rs131451 
polymorphism may shed light on sex discrepancy in CRC development and prognosis.
