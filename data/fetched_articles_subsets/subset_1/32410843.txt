The frequency of PIK3CA mutation and amplification was various and their 
clinical significances have not been clarified in Korean patients with invasive 
breast carcinoma (IBC). The study aimed to investigate the clinical and 
prognostic significances of PIK3CA mutation and amplification in IBC patients. 
DNA was isolated from paired normal and tumoral tissues in 128 IBC patients and 
the mutation and expression of PIK3CA gene were analyzed. PIK3CA mutation and 
expression was detected in 14.3% and 21.9% of IBC patients, respectively. And 
the level of PIK3CA expression was not different according to the presence of 
PIK3CA mutation (p = 0.775). PIK3CA mutation and expression were significantly 
associated with Luminal A type (p = 0.017 and p = 0.011, respectively). However, 
they did not have any clinical and prognostic values for IBC patients. This 
result suggested that alterations of PIK3CA pathway contribute to the 
pathogenesis of specific type of IBC.
