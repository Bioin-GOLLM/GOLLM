Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a rare type of non-Langerhans cell 
histiocytosis and is characterized by the diffuse histiocytic infiltration of 
multiple organs. Retroperitoneal ECD, especially with uterine involvement, is 
extremely rare. We report about a 73-year-old woman who presented with vaginal 
spotting for a month and experienced abdominal pain along with pus-like urine. 
Computed tomography revealed an irregular mass-like lesion in the uterus, 
possibly a uterine sarcoma, invading the ureter, rectosigmoid, and bladder. A 
tissue biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass revealed typical morphological and 
immunohistochemical features of ECD. However, clinical features, especially long 
bone involvement, did not coincide with ECD, and BRAF V600E gene mutation was 
not detected. We made a diagnosis of atypical retroperitoneal ECD mimicking 
uterine sarcoma with multiple organ involvement.
