Genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are extremely polymorphic and 
multiple CYP variants constitute clinically relevant biomarkers for the guidance 
of drug selection and dosing. We previously reported the distribution of the 
most relevant CYP alleles using population-scale sequencing data. Here, we 
update these findings by making use of the increasing wealth of data, 
incorporating whole exome and whole genome sequencing data from 141,614 
unrelated individuals across 12 human populations. We furthermore extend our 
previous studies by systematically considering also uncharacterized rare alleles 
and reveal that they contribute between 1.5% and 17.5% to the overall 
genetically encoded functional variability. By using established guidelines, we 
aggregate and translate the available sequencing data into population-specific 
patterns of metabolizer phenotypes. Combined, the presented data refine the 
worldwide landscape of ethnogeographic variability in CYP genes and aspire to 
provide a relevant resource for the optimization of population-specific 
genotyping strategies and precision public health.
