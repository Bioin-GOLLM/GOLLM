In Nepal, we tested 300 males for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
activity. Two subjects were G6PD deficient (0.67%). Compared with normal 
controls, G6PD activity was 12% and 26%, respectively. The hemoglobin 
concentration of these two subjects was normal. We extracted genomic DNA from 
whole blood and read all sequences of G6PD. Both subjects had the same 
replacement of 563C>T, which was classified as G6PD Mediterranean. The amino 
acid might change from Ser to Phe at codon 188. These subjects also had a 
replacement of 1311C>T, which caused no replacement of an amino acid. A similar 
replacement pattern of G6PD Mediterranean is described from persons living in 
Mediterranean countries and Middle East countries. However, G6PD Mediterranean 
found in India and Pakistan has no replacement at nucleotide 1311. Thus, these 
two subjects in Kathmandu, Nepal, would be closer to people in Middle East 
countries than people in India. This is the first study of molecular analysis 
for G6PD deficiency in Nepal.
