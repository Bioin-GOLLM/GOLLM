Social isolation during opioid withdrawal is a major contributor to the current 
opioid addiction crisis. We find that sociability deficits during protracted 
opioid withdrawal in mice require activation of kappa opioid receptors (KORs) in 
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) medial shell. Blockade of release from dynorphin 
(Pdyn)-expressing dorsal raphe neurons (DRPdyn), but not from NAcPdyn neurons, 
prevents these deficits in prosocial behaviors. Conversely, optogenetic 
activation of DRPdyn neurons reproduced NAc KOR-dependent decreases in 
sociability. Deletion of KORs from serotonin (5-HT) neurons, but not from NAc 
neurons or dopamine (DA) neurons, prevented sociability deficits during 
withdrawal. Finally, measurements with the genetically encoded GRAB5-HT sensor 
revealed that during withdrawal KORs block the NAc 5-HT release that normally 
occurs during social interactions. These results define a neuromodulatory 
mechanism that is engaged during protracted opioid withdrawal to induce 
maladaptive deficits in prosocial behaviors, which in humans contribute to 
relapse.
