The low-threshold L-type calcium channel Cav1.3 accelerates the pacemaker rate 
in the heart, but its functional role for the extended dynamic range of neuronal 
firing is still unresolved. Here, we show that Cav1.3 calcium channels act as 
unexpectedly simple, full-range linear amplifiers of firing rates for lateral 
dopamine substantia nigra (DA SN) neurons in mice. This means that they boost in 
vitro or in vivo firing frequencies between 2 and 50 hertz by about 30%. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant, low nanomolar 
concentrations of the L-type channel inhibitor isradipine selectively reduce the 
in vivo firing activity of these nigrostriatal DA SN neurons at therapeutic 
plasma concentrations. Thus, our study identifies the pacemaker function of 
neuronal Cav1.3 channels and provides direct evidence that repurposing 
dihydropyridines such as isradipine is feasible to selectively modulate the in 
vivo activity of highly vulnerable DA SN subpopulations in Parkinson's disease.
