The presence or absence of oxygen in the environment is a strong effector of 
cellular metabolism and physiology. Like many eukaryotes and some bacteria, 
Bacillus subtilis primarily utilizes oxygen during respiration to generate ATP. 
Despite the importance of oxygen for B. subtilis survival, we know little about 
how populations adapt to shifts in oxygen availability. Here, we find that when 
oxygen was depleted from stationary phase B. subtilis cultures, ∼90% of cells 
died while the remaining cells maintained colony-forming ability. We discover 
that production of the antimicrobial surfactin confers two oxygen-related 
fitness benefits: it increases aerobic growth yield by increasing oxygen 
diffusion, and it maintains viability during oxygen depletion by depolarizing 
the membrane. Strains unable to produce surfactin exhibited an ∼50-fold 
reduction in viability after oxygen depletion. Surfactin treatment of these 
cells led to membrane depolarization and reduced ATP production. Chemical and 
genetic perturbations that alter oxygen consumption or redox state support a 
model in which surfactin-mediated membrane depolarization maintains viability 
through slower oxygen consumption and/or a shift to a more reduced metabolic 
profile. These findings highlight the importance of membrane potential in 
regulating cell physiology and growth, and demonstrate that antimicrobials that 
depolarize cell membranes can benefit cells when the terminal electron acceptor 
in respiration is limiting. This foundational knowledge has deep implications 
for environmental microbiology, clinical anti-bacterial therapy, and industrial 
biotechnology.
