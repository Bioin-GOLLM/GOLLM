The authors performed analysis of the prion protein gene (PRNP) in 27 out of 109 
confirmed prion disease patients between 1994 and 2004. E200K mutation was found 
in 17 cases. Another 10 patients, lacking PRNP analysis, showed positive family 
history. The mean annual incidence (0.27/million) and proportion (25.6%) of 
genetic prion disease is unusually high in Hungary and might be related to the 
migration of ancestors from the Slovakian focus.
