BACKGROUND: Several articles suggest that DNA methylation levels in blood relate 
to Parkinson's disease (PD) but there is a need for a large-scale study that 
involves suitable population based controls. The purposes of the study were: (1) 
to study whether PD status is associated with DNA methylation levels in 
blood/saliva; (2) to study whether observed associations relate to blood cell 
types; and (3) to characterize genome-wide significant markers ("CpGs") and 
clusters of CpGs (co-methylation modules) in terms of biological pathways.
METHODS: In a population-based case control study of PD, we studied blood 
samples from 335 PD cases and 237 controls and saliva samples from another 128 
cases and 131 controls. DNA methylation data were generated from over 486,000 
CpGs using the Illumina Infinium array. We identified modules of CpGs (clusters) 
using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA).
RESULTS: Our cross-sectional analysis of blood identified 82 genome-wide 
significant CpGs (including cg02489202 in LARS2 p = 8.3 × 10-11 and cg04772575 
in ABCB9 p = 4.3 × 10-10). Three out of six PD related co-methylation modules in 
blood were significantly enriched with immune system related genes. Our analysis 
of saliva identified five significant CpGs. PD-related CpGs are located near 
genes that relate to mitochondrial function, neuronal projection, cytoskeleton 
organization, systemic immune response, and iron handling.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that: (1) PD status has a profound 
association with DNA methylation levels in blood and saliva; and (2) the most 
significant PD-related changes reflect changes in blood cell composition. 
Overall, this study highlights the role of the immune system in PD etiology but 
future research will need to address the causal structure of these 
relationships.
