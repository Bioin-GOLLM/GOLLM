Autophagy contributes to cellular homeostasis in the face of nutrient 
deprivation and other cellular stresses. Cell type-specific functions for 
autophagy are critical in maintaining homeostasis at both the tissue level and 
at the whole-organism level. Recent work has highlighted the ways in which human 
genetic variants modulate autophagy to alter epithelial and immune responses in 
inflammatory bowel disease.
