OBJECTIVES: Mutations in the GBA gene occur in 7% of patients with Parkinson 
disease (PD) and are a well-established susceptibility factor for PD, which is 
characterized by Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologic changes (LBDNCs). We 
sought to determine whether GBA influences risk of dementia with LBDNCs, 
Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (ADNCs), or both.
METHODS: We screened the entire GBA coding region for mutations in controls and 
in subjects with dementia and LBDNCs and no or low levels of ADNCs (pure 
dementia with Lewy bodies [pDLB]), LBDNCs and high-level ADNCs (LBD-AD), and 
high-level ADNCs but without LBDNCs (AD).
RESULTS: Among white subjects, pathogenic GBA mutations were identified in 6 of 
79 pDLB cases (7.6%), 8 of 222 LBD-AD cases (3.6%), 2 of 243 AD cases (0.8%), 
and 3 of 381 controls (0.8%). Subjects with pDLB and LBD-AD were more likely to 
carry mutations than controls (pDLB: odds ratio [OR] = 7.6; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.8-31.9; p = 0.006; LBD-AD: OR = 4.6; CI = 1.2-17.6; p = 
0.025), but there was no significant difference in frequencies between the AD 
and control groups (OR = 1.1; CI = 0.2-6.6; p = 0.92). There was a highly 
significant trend test across groups (χ(2)(1) = 19.3; p = 1.1 × 10(-5)), with 
the likelihood of carrying a GBA mutation increasing in the following direction: 
control/AD < LBD-AD < pDLB.
CONCLUSIONS: GBA is a susceptibility gene across the LBD spectrum, but not in 
AD, and appears to convey a higher risk for PD and pDLB than for LBD-AD. PD and 
pDLB might be more similar to one another in genetic determinants and 
pathophysiology than either disease is to LBD-AD.
