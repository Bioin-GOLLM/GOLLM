Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by symptoms of 
lymphopenia and multiorgan damage, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. 
To explore the function of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in COVID-19, 
we performed microarray analyses to comprehensively characterize the m6A 
epitranscriptome. The results revealed distinct global m6A profiles in severe 
and mild COVID-19 patients. Programmed cell death and inflammatory response were 
the major biological processes modulated by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Further, RBM15, a major m6A 
methyltransferase, was significantly elevated and positively correlated with 
disease severity. Silencing RBM15 drastically reduced lymphocyte death in vitro. 
Knockdown of RBM15 remarkably suppressed the expression levels of multitarget 
genes related to programmed cell death and inflammatory response. This study 
shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the m6A epitranscriptome of lymphocytes, 
particularly in the case of severe patients. RBM15 regulated host immune 
response to SARS-CoV-2 by elevating m6A modifications of multitarget genes. 
These findings indicate that RBM15 can serve as a target for the treatment of 
COVID-19.
