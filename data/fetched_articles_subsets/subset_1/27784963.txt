AIM: To evaluate the impact of the Glu167Lys (E167K) transmembrane 6 superfamily 
member 2 (TM6SF2) variant on the biochemical and morphologic expression of liver 
lesions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
co-infected patients.
METHODS: The study comprised 167 consecutive patients with HIV/HCV coinfection 
and biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis. A pathologist graded liver fibrosis and 
necroinflammation using the Ishak scoring system, and steatosis using Kleiner's 
scoring system. Patients were genotyped for TM6SF2 E167K (rs58542926) by 
real-time Polymerase chain reaction. The 167 patients, 35 therapy-naive and 132 
receiving ART, were prevalently males (73.6%), the median age was 40.7 years and 
the immunological condition good (median CD4+ cells/mm3 = 505.5).
RESULTS: The 17 patients with the TM6SF2 E167K variant, compared with the 150 
with TM6SF2-E/E, showed higher AST (P = 0.02) and alanine aminotransferase (P = 
0.02) and higher fibrosis score (3.1 ± 2.0 vs 2.3 ± 1.5, P = 0.05). In a 
multivariate analysis, TM6SF2 E167K was independently associated with severe 
fibrosis. The same analysis showed that HCV-genotype 3, present in 42.2% of 
patients was an independent predictor of severe steatosis. The association of 
TM6SF2 E167K with severe steatosis, absent for the whole group of 167 patients, 
was re-evaluated separately for HCV-genotype 3 and non-3 patients: No factor was 
independently associated with severe steatosis in the HCV-genotype-3 subgroup, 
whereas an independent association was observed between severe steatosis and 
TM6SF2 E167K in non-3 HCV genotypes. No association between the TM6SF2 E167K 
variant and severe liver necroinflammation was observed.
CONCLUSION: In HIV/HCV coinfection the TM6SF2 E167K variant is an independent 
predictor of severe fibrosis, but appears to be independently associated with 
severe steatosis only for patients with a non-3 HCV genotype.
