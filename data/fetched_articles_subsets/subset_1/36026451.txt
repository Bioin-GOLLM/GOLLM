How neurons can maintain cellular identity over an entire life span remains 
largely unknown. Here, we show that maintenance of identity in differentiated 
dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons is critically reliant on the Polycomb 
repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Deletion of the obligate PRC2 component, Eed, in 
these neurons resulted in global loss of H3K27me3, followed by a gradual 
activation of genes harboring both H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 modifications. Notably, 
H3K9me3 was lost at these PRC2 targets before gene activation. Neuronal survival 
was not compromised; instead, there was a reduction in subtype-specific gene 
expression and a progressive impairment of dopaminergic and serotonergic 
neuronal function, leading to behavioral deficits characteristic of Parkinson's 
disease and anxiety. Single-cell analysis revealed subtype-specific 
vulnerability to loss of PRC2 repression in dopamine neurons of the substantia 
nigra. Our study reveals that a PRC2-dependent nonpermissive chromatin state is 
essential to maintain the subtype identity and function of dopaminergic and 
serotonergic neurons.
