Mutations in the hedgehog (Hh) signaling are implicated in birth defects and 
cancers, including medulloblastoma (MB), one of the most malignant pediatric 
brain tumors. Current Hh inhibitors face the challenge of drug resistance and 
tumor relapse, urging new insights in the Hh pathway regulation. Our previous 
study revealed how PDE4D controls global levels of cAMP in the cytoplasm to 
positively regulate Hh signaling; in the present study, we found that a specific 
isoform PDE4D3 is tethered to the centrosome by Myomegalin (Mmg), a 
centrosome/Golgi-associated protein. Mmg loss dislocates PDE4D3 from the 
centrosome, leading to local PKA overactivation and inhibition of the Hh 
signaling, leaving other PKA-related pathways unaffected. Mmg loss suppresses 
the proliferation of granule neuron precursors and blocks the growth of MB in 
mouse model. Our findings specify a new regulatory mechanism of the Hh pathway 
and highlight an exciting therapeutic avenue for Hh-related cancers with reduced 
side effects.
