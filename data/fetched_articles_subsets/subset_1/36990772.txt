Outcomes of patients with histologic transformation (HT) of follicular lymphoma 
(FL) have been believed to be poor. The most common histologic subtype of 
transformation from FL is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which accounts 
for 90% of the cases, and the remaining 10% of the cases include classic Hodgkin 
lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma, B-acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma, and 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma-like lymphoma. Because the histologic criteria 
for the diagnosis of DLBCL transformed from FL are unclear, convenient 
histopathological criteria for HT are required. One of the proposed criteria of 
HT from our institute is the presence of diffuse architecture with a proportion 
of large lymphoma cells of ≥20%, and for challenging cases, Ki-67 index ≥50% is 
used as a reference. Patients with HT to non-DLBCL have poorer outcomes than 
those with HT to DLBCL; thus, rapid and accurate histologic diagnosis is 
desired. In this review, we discussed the recent literatures describing the 
histopathologic variety and proposal of definition of HT.
