PURPOSE: I-labeled human serum amyloid P component (SAP) is used clinically only 
in the UK for imaging visceral amyloidosis to assist with diagnosis, disease 
staging, and monitoring response to therapy. We compare a new amyloid-reactive 
probe, peptide p5, with SAP for imaging amyloidosis.
PROCEDURES: Dual-energy SPECT/CT images were acquired of (125)I-labeled SAP and 
(99m)Tc-labeled p5 in mice with systemic AA amyloidosis (n = 3). Twelve organs 
and tissues were harvested for radiotracer biodistribution assessment and for 
micro-autoradiographic analysis.
RESULTS: I-SAP and (99m)Tc-p5 localized equivalently in amyloid deposits in 
liver (∼10% injected dose (ID)/g) whereas (125)I-SAP was twofold higher in the 
spleen (∼20% ID/g; (99m)Tc-p5, ∼10% ID/g). In contrast, (99m)Tc-p5 was bound to 
pancreatic and intestinal amyloid approximately fivefold more efficiently as 
evidenced in biodistribution data.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiolabeled p5 is an effective amyloid-imaging radiotracer as 
compared to SAP in the murine model of amyloidosis and may be rapidly translated 
for imaging patients with visceral amyloidosis in the USA.
