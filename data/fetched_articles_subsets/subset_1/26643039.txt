Comprehensive identification of insertions/deletions (indels) across the full 
size spectrum from second generation sequencing is challenging due to the 
relatively short read length inherent in the technology. Different indel calling 
methods exist but are limited in detection to specific sizes with varying 
accuracy and resolution. We present ScanIndel, an integrated framework for 
detecting indels with multiple heuristics including gapped alignment, split 
reads and de novo assembly. Using simulation data, we demonstrate ScanIndel's 
superior sensitivity and specificity relative to several state-of-the-art indel 
callers across various coverage levels and indel sizes. ScanIndel yields higher 
predictive accuracy with lower computational cost compared with existing tools 
for both targeted resequencing data from tumor specimens and high coverage 
whole-genome sequencing data from the human NIST standard NA12878. Thus, we 
anticipate ScanIndel will improve indel analysis in both clinical and research 
settings. ScanIndel is implemented in Python, and is freely available for 
academic use at https://github.com/cauyrd/ScanIndel.
