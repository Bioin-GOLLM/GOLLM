BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness 
in elderly individuals in developed countries. The etiology and pathophysiology 
of age-related macular degeneration have not been elucidated yet. Knowing that 
the main pathological change of age-related macular degeneration is formation of 
drusen containing about 40% of lipids, there have been attempts to find 
associations between age-related macular degeneration and genes controlling 
lipid metabolism.
PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of CYP2C19 (G681A) Rs4244285 and CYP1A2 
(-163C>A) Rs762551 genotypes in patients with age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: The study enrolled 150 patients with early age-related macular 
degeneration and 296 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The genotyping of 
Rs4244285 and Rs762551 was carried out by using the real-time polymerase chain 
reaction method.
RESULTS: The CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 C/C genotype was more frequently detected 
in patients with age-related macular degeneration than in the control group 
(32.7% vs. 21.6%, p = 0.011) and was associated with an increased risk of 
developing early age-related macular degeneration (OR = 1.759, 95% CI: 
1.133-2.729; p = 0.012). The CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 C/A genotype was more 
frequently documented in the control group compared with patients with 
age-related macular degeneration (46.3% vs. 30.7%, p = 0.002) and was associated 
with a decreased risk of having age-related macular degeneration (OR = 0.580. 
95% CI: 0.362-0.929, p = 0.023) in the co-dominant model.
CONCLUSION: The study showed that the CYP1A2 (-163C>A) Rs762551 C/C genotype was 
associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration.
