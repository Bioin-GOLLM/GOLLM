OBJECTIVES: Inflammation plays a major role in psoriasis (Ps). The variation at 
several genes that encode components of the inflammatory pathways have been 
linked to the risk for Ps. Our objective was to examine the association between 
Ps and three polymorphisms at the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2.
METHODS: A total of 382 Ps patients and 500 healthy controls from Spain were 
genotyped for the CCR5-32bp deletion (DeltaCCR5), the rs1799988 (CCR5 promoter), 
and the CCR2-I64V (rs1799864) polymorphisms.
RESULTS: Allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and 
controls for any of the three polymorphisms. However, the frequency of the 
CCR2-64I carriers was significantly higher in the patients who developed 
arthritis (n=81) compared to patients without arthritis (p=0.0007).
CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that the genetic variation at the CCR2/CCR5 genes 
did not contribute to the risk for Ps, but CCR2 polymorphisms could modulate the 
risk for arthritis in patients with psoriasis.
