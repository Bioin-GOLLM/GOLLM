Gene expression signatures have been used to predict the outcome of chemotherapy 
for breast cancer. The nucleosome footprint of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) carries 
gene expression information of the original tissues and thus may be used to 
predict the response to chemotherapy. Here we carried out the nucleosome 
positioning on cfDNA from 85 breast cancer patients and 85 healthy individuals 
and two cancer cell lines T-47D and MDA-MB-231 using low-coverage whole-genome 
sequencing (LCWGS) method. The patients showed distinct nucleosome footprints at 
Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) compared with normal donors. In order to 
identify the footprints of cfDNA corresponding with the responses to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in patients, we mapped on nucleosome positions on cfDNA of patients 
with different responses: responders (pretreatment, n = 28; post-1 cycle, 
post-3/4 cycles, and post-8 cycles of treatment, n = 12) and nonresponders 
(pretreatment, n = 10; post-1 cycle, post-3/4 cycles, and post-8 cycles of 
treatment, n = 10). The coverage depth near TSSs in plasma cfDNA differed 
significantly between responders and nonresponders at pretreatment, and also 
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment cycles. We identified 232 TSSs with 
differential footprints at pretreatment and 321 after treatment and found 
enrichment in Gene Ontology terms such as cell growth inhibition, tumor 
suppressor, necrotic cell death, acute inflammatory response, T cell receptor 
signaling pathway, and positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor 
production. These results suggest that cfDNA nucleosome footprints may be used 
to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients 
and thus may provide help in decision making for individual patients.
