Standards of care for meningioma include surgical resection and radiotherapy 
whereas pharmacotherapy plays almost no role in this disease. We generated 
primary cultures from surgically removed meningiomas to explore the activity of 
a novel cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, TG02, in meningioma cell cultures. 
Tumor and cell cultures were characterized by mutation profiling and DNA 
methylation profiling. DNA methylation data were used to allot each sample to 
one out of six previously established meningioma methylation classes: benign 
(ben)-1, 2, 3, intermediate (int)-A, B, and malignant (mal). Four tumors 
assigned to the methylation class ben-2 showed the same class in culture whereas 
cultures from five non-ben-2 tumors showed a more malignant class in four 
patients. Cell cultures were uniformly sensitive to TG02 in the nanomolar range. 
Assignment of the cell cultures to a more malignant methylation class appeared 
to be more closely associated with TG02 sensitivity than assignment to a higher 
WHO grade of the primary tumors. Primary cell cultures from meningioma 
facilitate the investigation of the anti-meningioma activity of novel agents. 
TG02, an orally available cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, warrants 
further exploration.
