The start of 2022 was marked by the sudden surge in the detection of the viral 
disease - monkeypox. The recent and ongoing COVID-19 epidemic makes the 
re-emerging of viral zoonosis particularly worrisome. The rapid spread of the 
monkeypox virus has sparked concerns about the start of a new epidemic. In this 
review, I summarize the epidemiology, clinical signs, and symptoms, 
transmission, diagnosis, management, and prevention of the monkeypox virus. 
Clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for monkeypox in patients with 
high-risk factors presenting with new onset progressive rash. Patients with 
confirmed or suspected monkeypox infections need to be isolated until all the 
lesions have resolved.
