BACKGROUND: The purpose of this research was to investigate the association 
between alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) 
polymorphisms and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) survival.
METHODS: We genotyped ADH1B (rs1229984) and ALDH2 (rs671) single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) in 85 Japanese male patients with hypopharyngeal SCC. The 
independent prognostic values of ADH1B-ALDH2 genotypes were analyzed by 
univariate and multivariate proportional hazard Cox regression, taking 
well-known clinical risk factors into account.
RESULTS: Heavy drinkers with ALDH2*2 allele resulted in significantly worse 
overall survival (OS; P = .028) and disease-free survival (DFS; P = .029) 
compared with other patients. Heavy drinkers with ALDH2*2 allele remained 
statistically significant in multivariate analysis for OS and DFS, indicating 
independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio [HR] 2.251; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.018-4.975 and HR 2.261; 95% CI 1.021-5.006, respectively).
CONCLUSION: We conclude that heavy drinkers with the ALDH2*2 allele are 
associated with poor outcome in hypopharyngeal SCC.
