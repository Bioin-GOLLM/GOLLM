The c.825C>T single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs5443) of the guanine 
nucleotide-binding protein subunit β3 (GNB3) results in increased intracellular 
signal transduction via G-proteins. The present study investigated the effect of 
the GNB3 c.825C>T polymorphism on cardiovascular events among renal allograft 
recipients posttransplant. Our retrospective study involved 436 renal allograft 
recipients who were followed up for up to 8 years after transplant. The GNB3 
c.825C>T polymorphism was detected with restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The GNB3 TT genotype was detected in 43 
(10%) of 436 recipients. Death due to an acute cardiovascular event occurred 
more frequently among recipients with the TT genotype (4 [9%]) than among those 
with the CC/CT genotypes (7 [2%]; p = 0.003). The rates of myocardial infarction 
(MI)−free survival (p = 0.003) and acute peripheral artery occlusive disease 
(PAOD)−free survival (p = 0.004) were significantly lower among T-homozygous 
patients. A multivariate analysis showed that homozygous GNB3 c.825C>T 
polymorphism exerted only a mild effect for the occurrence of myocardial 
infarction (relative risk, 2.2; p = 0.065) or acute PAOD (relative risk, 2.4; p 
= 0.05) after renal transplant. Our results suggest that the homozygous GNB3 T 
allele exerts noticeable effects on the risk of MI and acute PAOD only in the 
presence of additional nonheritable risk factors.
