Alphaviruses are enveloped single stranded RNA viruses, which as gene therapy 
vectors provide high-level transient gene expression. Semliki Forest virus 
(SFV), Sindbis virus (SIN) and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus have 
been engineered as efficient replication-deficient and -competent expression 
vectors. Alphavirus vectors have frequently been used as vehicles for tumor 
vaccine generation. Moreover, SFV and SIN vectors have been applied for 
intratumoral injections in animals implanted with tumor xenografts. SIN vectors 
have demonstrated natural tumor targeting, which might permit systemic vector 
administration. Another approach for systemic delivery of SFV has been to 
encapsulate replication-deficient viral particles in liposomes, which can 
provide passive targeting to tumors and allow repeated administration without 
host immune responses. This approach has demonstrated safe delivery of 
encapsulated SFV particles to melanoma and kidney carcinoma patients in a phase 
I trial. Finally, the prominent neurotropism of alphaviruses make them 
attractive for the treatment of CNS-related diseases.
