BACKGROUNDPemphigus, a rare autoimmune bullous disease mediated by 
antidesmoglein autoantibodies, can be controlled with systemic medication like 
rituximab and high-dose systemic corticosteroids combined with 
immunosuppressants. However, some patients continue to experience chronically 
recurrent blisters in a specific area and require long-term maintenance systemic 
therapy.METHODSSkin with chronic blisters was obtained from patients with 
pemphigus. Immunologic properties of the skin were analyzed by 
immunofluorescence staining, bulk and single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing, and a 
highly multiplex imaging technique known as CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX). 
Functional analyses were performed by flow cytometry and bulk RNA-Seq using 
peripheral blood from healthy donors. Intralesional corticosteroid was injected 
into patient skin, and changes in chronically recurrent blisters were 
observed.RESULTSWe demonstrated the presence of skin tertiary lymphoid 
structures (TLSs) with desmoglein-specific B cells in chronic blisters from 
patients with pemphigus. In the skin TLSs, CD4+ T cells predominantly produced 
CXCL13. These clonally expanded CXCL13+CD4+ T cells exhibited features of 
activated Th1-like cells and downregulated genes associated with T cell 
receptor-mediated signaling. Tregs are in direct contact with CXCL13+CD4+ memory 
T cells and increased CXCL13 production of CD4+ T cells through IL-2 consumption 
and TGF-Î² stimulation. Finally, intralesional corticosteroid injection improved 
chronic blisters and reduced skin TLSs in patients with 
pemphigus.CONCLUSIONThrough this study we conclude that skin TLSs are associated 
with the persistence of chronically recurrent blisters in patients with 
pemphigus, and the microenvironmental network involving CXCL13+CD4+ T cells and 
Tregs within these structures plays an important role in CXCL13 production.TRIAL
