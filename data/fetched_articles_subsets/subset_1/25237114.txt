Genetic mapping studies in the mouse and other model organisms are used to 
search for genes underlying complex phenotypes. Traditional genetic mapping 
studies that employ single-generation crosses have poor mapping resolution and 
limit discovery to loci that are polymorphic between the two parental strains. 
Multiparent outbreeding populations address these shortcomings by increasing the 
density of recombination events and introducing allelic variants from multiple 
founder strains. However, multiparent crosses present new analytical challenges 
and require specialized software to take full advantage of these benefits. Each 
animal in an outbreeding population is genetically unique and must be genotyped 
using a high-density marker set; regression models for mapping must accommodate 
multiple founder alleles, and complex breeding designs give rise to polygenic 
covariance among related animals that must be accounted for in mapping analysis. 
The Diversity Outbred (DO) mice combine the genetic diversity of eight founder 
strains in a multigenerational breeding design that has been maintained for >16 
generations. The large population size and randomized mating ensure the 
long-term genetic stability of this population. We present a complete analytical 
pipeline for genetic mapping in DO mice, including algorithms for probabilistic 
reconstruction of founder haplotypes from genotyping array intensity data, and 
mapping methods that accommodate multiple founder haplotypes and account for 
relatedness among animals. Power analysis suggests that studies with as few as 
200 DO mice can detect loci with large effects, but loci that account for <5% of 
trait variance may require a sample size of up to 1000 animals. The methods 
described here are implemented in the freely available R package DOQTL.
