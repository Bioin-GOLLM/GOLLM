Inflammation is known to be necessary for promoting, sustaining, and tuning CD8+ 
T cell responses. Following experimental Leishmania donovani infection, the 
inflammatory response is mainly induced by the transcription factor IRF-5. IRF-5 
is responsible for the activation of several genes encoding key pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF. Here, we investigate the role of IRF-5-mediated 
inflammation in regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during L. 
donovani infection. Our data demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced 
by IRF-5 limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α in dendritic cells. 
Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells resulted into a higher frequency of 
short-lived effector cells (SLEC), enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and increased 
IL-12 expression by splenic DCs. Moreover, mice with a targeted depletion of 
HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden, 
suggesting that induction of HIF-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism 
adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections.
