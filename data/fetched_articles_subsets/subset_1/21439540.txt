Autosomal-recessive congenital ichthyoses represent a large and heterogeneous 
group of disorders of epidermal cornification. Recent data suggest that most of 
these disorders might result from defective lipid transport and metabolism. In 
the present study, we describe a late-onset form of recessive ichthyosis in a 
large consanguineous pedigree. By using a combination of homozygosity mapping 
and positional candidate-gene screening, we identified a 2 bp deletion in LIPN 
that segregated with the disease phenotype throughout the family. LIPN encodes 
one of six acid lipases known to be involved in triglyceride metabolism in 
mammals . LIPN was found to be exclusively expressed in the epidermis and to be 
strongly induced during keratinocyte differentiation.
