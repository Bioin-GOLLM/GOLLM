Indirect measurements have previously suggested that patients with classical 
phenylketonuria (PKU) do not convert significant amounts of phenylalanine to 
tyrosine. Low-dose continuous infusion techniques employing [2H5]phenylalanine 
and [2H2]tyrosine were used to quantitate in vivo phenylalanine hydroxylation in 
10 subjects with classical phenylketonuria, 2 with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), 
and 7 controls. Plasma phenylalanine concentration ranged from 523 to 1,540 
mumols/liter in PKU, 402 to 533 in HPA, and 49 to 54 in controls. Subjects with 
classical PKU hydroxylated mean +/- SD 4.8 +/- 2.2 mumols/kg per h (range 
0.9-8.4) of phenylalanine to tyrosine and those with HPA 4.4 and 5.3, 
respectively. These rates were substantial in comparison with those in controls 
(6.3 +/- 1.6, 3.2-8.2). The significant hydroxylation in PKU and HPA subjects is 
likely to result from induction of activity of tyrosine hydroxylase towards 
phenylalanine by the greatly elevated phenylalanine concentration. The presence 
of such activity in PKU suggests that therapy aimed at promotion of this usually 
latent hydroxylating capacity may be a future alternative to dietary treatment 
of PKU.
