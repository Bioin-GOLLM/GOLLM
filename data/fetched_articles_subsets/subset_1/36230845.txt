Overexpression of the neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTS1R), a peptide receptor 
located at the plasma membrane, has been reported for a variety of malignant 
tumors. Thus, targeting the NTS1R with 18F- or 68Ga-labeled ligands is 
considered a straightforward approach towards in vivo imaging of 
NTS1R-expressing tumors via positron emission tomography (PET). The development 
of suitable peptidic NTS1R PET ligands derived from neurotensin is challenging 
due to proteolytic degradation. In this study, we prepared a series of NTS1R PET 
ligands based on the C-terminal fragment of neurotensin (NT(8-13), 
Arg8-Arg9-Pro10-Tyr11-Ile12-Leu13) by attachment of the chelator 
1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) via an 
Nω-carbamoylated arginine side chain. Insertion of Ga3+ in the DOTA chelator 
gave potential PET ligands that were evaluated concerning NTS1R affinity (range 
of Ki values: 1.2-21 nM) and plasma stability. Four candidates were labeled with 
68Ga3+ and used for biodistribution studies in HT-29 tumor-bearing mice. 
[68Ga]UR-LS130 ([68Ga]56), containing an N-terminal methyl group and a 
β,β-dimethylated tyrosine instead of Tyr11, showed the highest in vivo stability 
and afforded a tumor-to-muscle ratio of 16 at 45 min p.i. Likewise, dynamic PET 
scans enabled a clear tumor visualization. The accumulation of [68Ga]56 in the 
tumor was NTS1R-mediated, as proven by blocking studies.
