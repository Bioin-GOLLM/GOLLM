Solubility is a property of central importance for the use of proteins in 
research in molecular and cell biology and in applications in biotechnology and 
medicine. Since experimental methods for measuring protein solubility are 
material intensive and time consuming, computational methods have recently 
emerged to enable the rapid and inexpensive screening of solubility for large 
libraries of proteins, as it is routinely required in development pipelines. 
Here, we describe the development of one such method to include in the 
predictions the effect of the pH on solubility. We illustrate the resulting 
pH-dependent predictions on a variety of antibodies and other proteins to 
demonstrate that these predictions achieve an accuracy comparable with that of 
experimental methods. We make this method publicly available at 
https://www-cohsoftware.ch.cam.ac.uk/index.php/camsolph, as the version 3.0 of 
CamSol.
