INTRODUCTION: Insulin resistance plays a major role in metabolic syndrome and is 
recognized as the most common risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD). Identifying predictors for insulin resistance could optimize screening 
and prevention.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the contribution of multiple single nucleotide 
polymorphisms across genes related to NAFLD and choline metabolism, in 
predicting insulin resistance in children with obesity.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-three children with obesity (73 girls), aged 7-18 
years, were evaluated within the NutriGen Study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT02837367). Insulin resistance was defined by Homeostatic 
Model Assessment for insulin-resistance cut-offs that accommodated pubertal and 
gender differences. Anthropometric, metabolic, intake-related variables, and 55 
single nucleotide polymorphisms related to NAFLD and choline metabolism were 
evaluated. Gene-gene interaction effects were assessed using Multiple Data 
Reduction Software.
RESULTS: Sixty percent (93/153) of participants showed insulin resistance (58.7% 
of boys, 63% of girls). Children with insulin resistance presented significantly 
higher values for standardized body mass index, triglycerides, transaminases and 
plasma choline when compared to those without insulin resistance. Out of 52 
single nucleotide polymorphisms analysed, the interaction between genotypes 
CHDH(rs12676) and PNPLA3(rs738409) predicted insulin resistance. The model 
presented a 6/10 cross-validation consistency and 0.58 testing accuracy. Plasma 
choline levels and alanine aminotransferase modulated the gene interaction 
effect, significantly improving the model.
CONCLUSION: The interaction between genotypes in CHDH and PNPLA3 genes, 
modulated by choline and alanine aminotransferase levels, predicted 
insulin-resistance status in children with obesity. If replicated in larger 
cohorts, these findings could help identify metabolic risk in children with 
obesity.
