SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic which has claimed more than 6.5 
million lives worldwide, devastating the economy and overwhelming healthcare 
systems globally. The development of new drug molecules and vaccines has played 
a critical role in managing the pandemic; however, new variants of concern still 
pose a significant threat as the current vaccines cannot prevent all infections. 
This situation calls for the collaboration of biomedical scientists and 
healthcare workers across the world. Repurposing approved drugs is an effective 
way of fast-tracking new treatments for recently emerged diseases. To this end, 
we have assembled and curated a database consisting of 7817 compounds from the 
Compounds Australia Open Drug collection. We developed a set of eight filters 
based on indicators of efficacy and safety that were applied sequentially to 
down-select drugs that showed promise for drug repurposing efforts against 
SARS-CoV-2. Considerable effort was made to evaluate approximately 14,000 assay 
data points for SARS-CoV-2 FDA/TGA-approved drugs and provide an average 
activity score for 3539 compounds. The filtering process identified 12 
FDA-approved molecules with established safety profiles that have plausible 
mechanisms for treating COVID-19 disease. The methodology developed in our study 
provides a template for prioritising drug candidates that can be repurposed for 
the safe, efficacious, and cost-effective treatment of COVID-19, long COVID, or 
any other future disease. We present our database in an easy-to-use interactive 
interface (CoviRx that was also developed to enable the scientific community to 
access to the data of over 7000 potential drugs and to implement alternative 
prioritisation and down-selection strategies.
