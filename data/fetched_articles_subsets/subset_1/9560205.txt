In several forms of beta-thalassemia, mutations in the second intron of the 
beta-globin gene create aberrant 5' splice sites and activate a common cryptic 
3' splice site upstream. As a result, the thalassemic beta-globin pre-mRNAs are 
spliced almost exclusively via the aberrant splice sites leading to a deficiency 
of correctly spliced beta-globin mRNA and, consequently, beta-globin. We have 
designed a series of vectors that express modified U7 snRNAs containing 
sequences antisense to either the aberrant 5' or 3' splice sites in the IVS2-705 
thalassemic pre-mRNA. Transient expression of modified U7 snRNAs in a HeLa cell 
line stably expressing the IVS2-705 beta-globin gene restored up to 65% of 
correct splicing in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner. Cell lines 
that stably coexpressed IVS2-705 pre-mRNA and appropriately modified U7 snRNA 
exhibited up to 55% of permanent restoration of correct splicing and expression 
of full-length beta-globin protein. This novel approach provides a potential 
alternative to gene replacement therapies.
