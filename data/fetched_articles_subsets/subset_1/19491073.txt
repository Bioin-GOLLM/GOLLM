OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a patient with multiple endocrine neoplasia 
type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome with con-comitant parathyroid carcinoma and a classic 
MEN1 germline mutation.
METHODS: We present the clinical findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, 
and surgical histopathologic features in a woman with MEN 1 syndrome and 
concomitant parathyroid carcinoma. We also review the literature regarding 
patients with similar clinical entities and the use of adjuvant radiotherapy for 
parathyroid carcinoma.
RESULTS: A 53-year-old woman presented with nausea and severe primary 
hyperparathyroidism. Computed tomography revealed parathyroid masses, shown 
later to be bilateral parathyroid carcinomas and adenomas. Magnetic resonance 
imaging demonstrated a pituitary macroadenoma, and gastrinomas were confirmed by 
computed tomography and a secretin stimulation test. She was successfully 
treated with total thyroidectomy, subtotal parathyroidectomy, and adjuvant 
radiotherapy. Genetic analysis revealed a classic MEN1 germline mutation.
CONCLUSION: This report describes a patient with parathyroid carcinoma occurring 
in conjunction with MEN 1, further characterizing this rare condition. In 
contrast to previously described patients, our patient is the first with a 
classic MEN1 germline mutation, confirming that parathyroid cancer can occur in 
association with classic MEN 1 genetics.
