Upon fertilization, embryos undergo chromatin reprogramming and genome 
activation; however, the mechanisms that regulate these processes are poorly 
understood. Here, we generated a triple mutant for Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b 
(NPS) in zebrafish and found that NPS pioneer chromatin opening at >50% of 
active enhancers. NPS regulate acetylation across core histones at enhancers and 
promoters, and their function in gene activation can be bypassed by recruiting 
histone acetyltransferase to individual genes. NPS pioneer chromatin opening 
individually, redundantly, or additively depending on sequence context, and we 
show that high nucleosome occupancy facilitates NPS pioneering activity. 
Nucleosome position varies based on the input of different transcription factors 
(TFs), providing a flexible platform to modulate pioneering activity. 
Altogether, our results illuminate the sequence of events during genome 
activation and offer a conceptual framework to understand how pioneer factors 
interpret the genome and integrate different TF inputs across cell types and 
developmental transitions.
