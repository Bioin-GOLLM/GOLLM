Peripheral artery occlusive disease is common among diabetes mellitus (DM) and 
end-stage renal disease patients, and tends to progress faster and lead to worse 
outcomes. This study compared the association of DM with the decline in 
ankle-brachial index (ABI) among patients on hemodialysis (HD). This was a 
longitudinal analysis of ABI in HD patients from 2009 to 2015. Medical records 
and yearly ABI values were obtained. A longitudinal mixed-model analysis was 
used to evaluate ABI changing trends while accounting for within-patients 
correlation. There were 296 patients on HD in the period of 2009-2015. In a 
6-year follow-up, those with DM had a more rapid ABI decline compared to non-DM 
patients (slopes: -0.014 vs. 0.010 per year, interaction p < 0.001). In DM 
patients, female sex, high pulse pressure, high triglyceride, low creatinine, 
and high uric acid were associated with a decrease in ABI. In non-DM patients, 
old age, high pulse pressure, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high 
uric acid were associated with a decreased in ABI. There were 49.6% of patients 
with a normal ABI experienced a decrease at least 0.1 of ABI from baseline, and 
35.3% had a final ABI < 0.9 in patients with a baseline ABI â‰¥ 0.9 (n = 232). In 
this study, DM patients on HD tend to develop a more rapid decline in ABI than 
non-DM patients on HD. Age, sex, pulse pressure, lipid profile, creatinine, and 
uric acid are associated with a decreased in ABI.
