Recently, mutations in WWOX have been identified in the setting of central 
nervous system (CNS) disorders, highlighting a previously unrevealed role of 
this gene in the normal development and function of the CNS. In this report, we 
add five patients from two seemingly unrelated families presenting with a 
primarily neurological phenotype. All the children were product of 
consanguineous marriages. Whole exome sequencing revealed the same homozygous 
mutation (NM_016373.3:c.606-1G>A) of WWOX in all five patients. All patients and 
carriers in the family share the same haplotype indicating the families are in 
fact related to one another. The clinical presentation included progressive 
microcephaly, early onset of spasticity in the first 3 months of life, 
intractable epilepsy, severe failure to thrive, and profound developmental 
delay. Retinopathy was observed in two patients. All five patients died before 
their third birthday. Neuroimaging showed extensive neurodegeneration 
characterized by periventricular white matter volume loss and atrophy of the 
corpus callosum. Additional degeneration selectively affecting the mediodorsal 
nucleus of the thalamus was observed in one patient. Our findings in five new 
patients affected by WWOX mutation with early infantile phenotype confirm the 
features of the disease represented by early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. 
We suggest that neuroimaging in these patients reveals a characteristic pattern 
of neurodegeneration in which the cerebellum is spared that could help with 
early diagnosis in the appropriate clinical setting.
