Aberrant regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling has a crucial role in the onset 
and progression of cancers, where the effects are not always predictable 
depending on tumor context. In melanoma, for example, models of the disease 
predict differing effects of the WNT/β-catenin pathway on metastatic 
progression. Understanding the processes that underpin the highly 
context-dependent nature of WNT/β-catenin signaling in tumors is essential to 
achieve maximal therapeutic benefit from WNT inhibitory compounds. In this 
study, we have found that expression of the tumor suppressor, phosphatase and 
tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), alters the invasive potential of 
melanoma cells in response to WNT/β-catenin signaling, correlating with 
differing metabolic profiles. This alters the bioenergetic potential and 
mitochondrial activity of melanoma cells, triggered through regulation of 
pro-survival autophagy. Thus, WNT/β-catenin signaling is a regulator of 
catabolic processes in cancer cells, which varies depending on the metabolic 
requirements of tumors.
