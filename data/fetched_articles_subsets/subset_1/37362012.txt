Microplastic pollution is becoming a major issue for human health due to the 
recent discovery of microplastics in most ecosystems. Here, we review the 
sources, formation, occurrence, toxicity and remediation methods of 
microplastics. We distinguish ocean-based and land-based sources of 
microplastics. Microplastics have been found in biological samples such as 
faeces, sputum, saliva, blood and placenta. Cancer, intestinal, pulmonary, 
cardiovascular, infectious and inflammatory diseases are induced or mediated by 
microplastics. Microplastic exposure during pregnancy and maternal period is 
also discussed. Remediation methods include coagulation, membrane bioreactors, 
sand filtration, adsorption, photocatalytic degradation, electrocoagulation and 
magnetic separation. Control strategies comprise reducing plastic usage, 
behavioural change, and using biodegradable plastics. Global plastic production 
has risen dramatically over the past 70 years to reach 359 million tonnes. China 
is the world's top producer, contributing 17.5% to global production, while 
Turkey generates the most plastic waste in the Mediterranean region, at 144 
tonnes per day. Microplastics comprise 75% of marine waste, with land-based 
sources responsible for 80-90% of pollution, while ocean-based sources account 
for only 10-20%. Microplastics induce toxic effects on humans and animals, such 
as cytotoxicity, immune response, oxidative stress, barrier attributes, and 
genotoxicity, even at minimal dosages of 10 μg/mL. Ingestion of microplastics by 
marine animals results in alterations in gastrointestinal tract physiology, 
immune system depression, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, differential gene 
expression, and growth inhibition. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of microplastics 
in the tissues of aquatic organisms can have adverse effects on the aquatic 
ecosystem, with potential transmission of microplastics to humans and birds. 
Changing individual behaviours and governmental actions, such as implementing 
bans, taxes, or pricing on plastic carrier bags, has significantly reduced 
plastic consumption to 8-85% in various countries worldwide. The microplastic 
minimisation approach follows an upside-down pyramid, starting with prevention, 
followed by reducing, reusing, recycling, recovering, and ending with disposal 
as the least preferable option.
