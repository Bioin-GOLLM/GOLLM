Despite the advancements in targeted therapy for BRAFV600E-mutated metastatic 
colorectal cancer (mCRC), the development of resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition 
limits the response rate and durability of the treatment. Better understanding 
of the resistance mechanisms to BRAF inhibitors will facilitate the design of 
novel pharmacological strategies for BRAF-mutated mCRC. The aim of this study 
was to identify novel protein candidates involved in acquired resistance to 
BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAFV600E-mutated colon cancer cells using an 
integrated proteomics approach. Bioinformatic analysis of obtained proteomics 
data indicated actin-cytoskeleton linker protein ezrin as a highly ranked 
protein significantly associated with vemurafenib resistance whose 
overexpression in the resistant cells was additionally confirmed at the gene and 
protein level. Ezrin inhibition by NSC305787 increased anti-proliferative and 
pro-apoptotic effects of vemurafenib in the resistant cells in an additive 
manner, which was accompanied by downregulation of CD44 expression and 
inhibition of AKT/c-Myc activities. We also detected an increased ezrin 
expression in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cells harbouring the BRAFV600E 
mutation. Importantly, ezrin inhibition potentiated anti-proliferative and 
pro-apoptotic effects of vemurafenib in the resistant melanoma cells in a 
synergistic manner. Altogether, our study suggests a role of ezrin in acquired 
resistance to vemurafenib in colon cancer and melanoma cells carrying the 
BRAFV600E mutation and supports further pre-clinical and clinical studies to 
explore the benefits of combined BRAF inhibitors and actin-targeting drugs as a 
potential therapeutic approach for BRAFV600E-mutated cancers.
