The enzymatic activities of CD39 and CD73 play strategic roles in calibrating 
the duration, magnitude, and chemical nature of purinergic signals delivered to 
immune cells through the conversion of ADP/ATP to AMP and AMP to adenosine, 
respectively. This drives a shift from an ATP-driven proinflammatory environment 
to an anti-inflammatory milieu induced by adenosine. The CD39/CD73 pathway 
changes dynamically with the pathophysiological context in which it is embedded. 
It is becoming increasingly appreciated that altering this catabolic machinery 
can change the course or dictate the outcome of several pathophysiological 
events, such as AIDS, autoimmune diseases, infections, atherosclerosis, 
ischemia-reperfusion injury, and cancer, suggesting these ectoenzymes are novel 
therapeutic targets for managing a variety of disorders.
