INTRODUCTION: Studies from selected candidate genes suggest that 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in glutathione metabolism, DNA 
repair, or inflammatory responses may affect overall survival (OS) in stages I 
to II or low-stage non-small cell lung cancer (LS-NSCLC); however, results are 
inconclusive. In this study, we took a systematic pathway-based approach to 
simultaneously evaluate the impact of genetic variation from these three 
pathways on OS after LS-NSCLC diagnosis.
METHODS: DNA from 647 patients with LS-NSCLC was genotyped for 480 SNPs 
(tag-SNPs) tagging 57 genes from the three candidate pathways. Associations of 
tag-SNPs with OS were assessed at the individual SNP and whole gene levels, 
adjusting for age, tumor stage, surgery type, and adjuvant therapy. The genotype 
combinations of the SNPs associated with OS were also estimated.
RESULTS: Among the 412 tag-SNPs that were successfully genotyped and passed 
quality assessments, 28 showed association with OS (p < 0.05). Two of the 28 
were estimated to have less than a 20% chance of being false positives 
(rs3768490 in GSTM5: p = 1.32 × 10, q = 0.06; rs1729786 in ABCC4: p = 9.25 × 10, 
q = 0.20). Gene-based analysis suggested that in addition to GSTM5 and ABCC4, 
variation in two other genes, PTGS2 and GSTA2, was also associated with OS.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe further evidence that variations in genes involved in 
the glutathione and inflammatory response pathways are associated with OS in 
patients with LS-NSCLC. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings and 
elucidate their functional mechanisms and clinical utility leading to improved 
survival for patients with lung cancer.
