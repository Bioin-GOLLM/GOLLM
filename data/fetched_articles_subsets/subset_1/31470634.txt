Dentin consists of inorganic hard tissue and organic dentin matrix components 
(DMCs). Various kinds of bioactive molecules are included in DMCs and some of 
them can be released after digestion by endogenous matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) in the caries region. Digested DMCs induced by MMP20 have been reported 
to promote pulpal wound healing processes, but the released critical molecules 
responsible for this phenomenon are unclear. Here, we identified protein S100-A7 
as a critical molecule for pulpal healing in digested DMCs by comprehensive 
proteomic approaches and following pulp capping experiments in rat molars. In 
addition, immunohistochemical results indicated the specific distribution of 
S100-A7 and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) as receptor for 
S100-A7 in the early stage of the pulpal healing process, and following 
accumulation of CD146-positive stem cells in wounded pulp. Our findings indicate 
that protein S100-A7 released from dentin by MMP20 might play a key role in 
dentin pulp regeneration.
