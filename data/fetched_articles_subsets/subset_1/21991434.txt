Prostate cancer is the second common cancer in men worldwide. The prevention of 
prostate cancer remains a challenge to researchers and clinicians. Here, we 
review the relationship of vitamin D and sunlight to prostate cancer risk. 
Ultraviolet radiation of the sunlight is the main stimulator for vitamin D 
production in humans. Vitamin D's antiprostate cancer activities may be involved 
in the actions through the pathways mediated by vitamin D metabolites, vitamin D 
metabolizing enzymes, vitamin D receptor (VDR), and VDR-regulated genes. 
Although laboratory studies including the use of animal models have shown that 
vitamin D has antiprostate cancer properties, whether it can effectively prevent 
the development and/or progression of prostate cancer in humans remains to be 
inconclusive and an intensively studied subject. This review will provide 
up-to-date information regarding the recent outcomes of laboratory and 
epidemiology studies on the effects of vitamin D on prostate cancer prevention.
