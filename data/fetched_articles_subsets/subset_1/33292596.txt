T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is one of the hematological 
malignancies. With the applications of chemotherapy regimens and allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the cure rate of T-ALL has been 
significantly improved. However, patients with relapsed and refractory T-ALL 
still lack effective treatment options. Gene mutations play an important role in 
T-ALL. The NOTCH1 gene mutation is the important one among these genetic 
mutations. Since the mutation of NOTCH1 gene is considered as a driving oncogene 
in T-ALL, targeting the NOTCH1 signaling patheway may be an effective option to 
overcome relapsed and refractory T-ALL. This review mainly summarizes the recent 
research advances of targeting on NOTCH1 signaling pathway in T-ALL.
