Exploring early embryonic gene expression is challenging due to the rate of 
development and the limited material available. Here, we present a protocol for 
ordering Drosophila embryos along a developmental pseudo-time trajectory and 
determining the sex of the embryos using RNA-seq data. We describe steps for 
sample collection, RNA isolation, RNA-seq, and RNA-seq data processing. We then 
detail the establishment of a continuous transcriptome dataset for assessing 
gene expression throughout early development and in a sex-specific manner. For 
complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to 
Pérez-Mojica et al.1.
