Hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disorder, obesity, and 
type 2 diabetes, is prevalent among Indians who are at high risk of these 
metabolic disorders. We evaluated association of common variants of genes 
involved in homocysteine metabolism or its levels with type 2 diabetes, obesity, 
and related traits in North Indians. We genotyped 90 variants in initial phase 
(2.115 subjects) and replicated top signals in an independent sample set (2.085 
subjects). The variant MTHFR-rs1801133 was the top signal for association with 
type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.78 (95%  CI = 0.67-0.92), P = 0.003) and was also 
associated with 2 h postload plasma glucose (P = 0.04), high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (P = 0.004), and total cholesterol (P = 0.01) in control subjects. 
These associations were neither replicated nor significant after meta-analysis. 
Studies involving a larger study population and different ethnic groups are 
required before ruling out the role of these important candidate genes in type 2 
diabetes, obesity, and related traits.
