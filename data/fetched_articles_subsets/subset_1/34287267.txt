In B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), the interaction between leukemic 
cells and the microenvironment promotes tumor cell survival. The Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib is one of the first-in-class molecules 
for the treatment of B-CLL patients; however, the emerging mechanisms of 
resistance to ibrutinib call for new therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the 
current study was to investigate the ability of ibrutinib plus the 
MDM2-inhibitor nutlin-3 to counteract the tumor microenvironment protective 
effect. We observed that primary B-CLL cells cultivated in microenvironment 
mimicking conditions were protected from apoptosis by the up-regulation of c-MYC 
and of p53. In the same setting, combined treatments with ibrutinib plus 
nutlin-3 led to significantly higher levels of apoptosis compared to the single 
treatments, counteracting the c-MYC up-regulation. Moreover, the combination 
induced high p53 levels and a significant dissipation of the mitochondrial 
membrane potential, together with BAX cleavage in the more active p18 form and 
phospho-BAD down-regulation, that are key components of the mitochondrial 
apoptotic pathway, enhancing the apoptosis level. Our findings propose a new 
therapeutic strategy to overcome the tumor microenvironment protection involved 
in B-CLL resistance to drugs, with possible clinical implications also for other 
hematologic and solid tumors for which ibrutinib is considered a therapeutic 
option.
