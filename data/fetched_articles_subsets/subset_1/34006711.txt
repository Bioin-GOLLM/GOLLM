Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine 
kinase the signaling of which is important for growth and progression of cancer. 
An exon 19 deletion mutation and an exon 21 L858R point mutation are frequently 
detected as EGFR mutations in patients with non‒small cell lung cancer. This 
review summarizes the differences in epidemiological, nonclinical, and clinical 
characteristics between the exon 19 deletion mutation and the exon 21 L858R 
point mutation.
