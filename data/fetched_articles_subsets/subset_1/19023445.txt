BACKGROUND: Mutations in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) 
cause Childhood Ataxia with CNS Hypomyelination (CACH), also known as Vanishing 
White Matter disease (VWM). The disease is manifested by loss of brain myelin 
upon physiological stress. In a previous study, we showed that fibroblasts 
isolated from CACH/VWM patients are hypersensitive to pharmacologically-induced 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Since brain cells from affected individuals 
are not available for research, we wished to assess the effect of eIF2B mutation 
on oligodendroglial-derived cells.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A rat oligodendroglial-derived cell line was 
used for a stable knock-down of eIF2B5 followed by stable expression of mutated 
eIF2B5(R195H) cDNA. In response to a pharmacological ER-stress agent, 
eIF2B5(R195H) expressing cells exhibited heightened ER-stress response 
demonstrated by hyper induction of ATF4, GADD34, Bip, PDIA1, PDIA3, PDIA4 and 
PDIA6 proteins. Moreover, even in the absence of a pharmacological stress agent, 
eIF2B5(R195H)-expressing cells exhibited high basal levels of ATF4, GADD34 and 
ER-associated Bip, PDIA1 and PDIA3.
SIGNIFICANCE: The data provide evidence that oligodendroglial-derived cells 
expressing a mutated eIF2B constantly use their stress response mechanism as an 
adaptation mean in order to survive. The current study is the first to 
demonstrate the effects of eIF2B5 mutation on ER homeostasis in 
oligodendroglial-derived cells.
