BACKGROUND: In developing countries, renal specialists are scarce and 
physician-to-patient contact time is limited. While conventional hospital-based, 
physician-oriented approach has been the main focus of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) care, a comprehensive multidisciplinary health care program (Integrated 
CKD Care) has been introduced as an alternate intervention to delay CKD 
progression in a community population. The main objective is to assess 
effectiveness of Integrated CKD Care in delaying CKD progression.
METHODS: We carried out a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial. 
Four hundred forty-two stage 3-4 CKD patients were enrolled. In addition to the 
standard treatments provided to both groups, the patients in the intervention 
group also received "Integrated CKD Care". This was delivered by a 
multidisciplinary team of hospital staff in conjunction with a community CKD 
care network (subdistrict healthcare officers and village health volunteers) to 
provide group counseling during each hospital visit and quarterly home visits to 
monitor compliance with the treatment. Duration of the study was 2 years. The 
primary outcome was difference of mean eGFR between the intervention and the 
control groups over the study period.
RESULTS: The mean difference of eGFR over time in the intervention group was 
significantly lower than the control group by 2.74 ml/min/1.73 m2 (95%CI 
0.60-4.50, p = 0.009). Seventy composite clinical endpoints were reported during 
the study period with significantly different incidences between the control and 
the intervention groups (119.1 versus 69.4 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio 
(HR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.4-0.9, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Integrated CKD Care can delay CKD progression in resource-limited 
settings.
