RNA methyltransferases (MTases) catalyse the transfer of a methyl group to their 
RNA substrates using most-often S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as cofactor. Only 
few RNA-bound MTases structures are currently available due to the difficulties 
in crystallising RNA:protein complexes. The lack of complex structures results 
in poorly understood RNA recognition patterns and methylation reaction 
mechanisms. On the contrary, many cofactor-bound MTase structures are available, 
resulting in well-understood protein:cofactor recognition, that can guide the 
design of bisubstrate analogues that mimic the state at which both the substrate 
and the cofactor is bound. Such bisubstrate analogues were recently synthesized 
for proteins monomethylating the N6-atom of adenine (m6A). These proteins 
include, amongst others, RlmJ in E. coli and METLL3:METT14 and METTL16 in human. 
As a proof-of-concept, we here test the ability of the bisubstrate analogues to 
mimic the substrate:cofactor bound state during catalysis by studying their 
binding to RlmJ using differential scanning fluorimetry, isothermal titration 
calorimetry and X-ray crystallography. We find that the methylated adenine base 
binds in the correct pocket, and thus these analogues could potentially be used 
broadly to study the RNA recognition and catalytic mechanism of m6A MTases. Two 
bisubstrate analogues bind RlmJ with micro-molar affinity, and could serve as 
starting scaffolds for inhibitor design against m6A RNA MTases. The same 
analogues cause changes in the melting temperature of the m1A RNA MTase, TrmK, 
indicating non-selective protein:compound complex formation. Thus, optimization 
of these molecular scaffolds for m6A RNA MTase inhibition should aim to increase 
selectivity, as well as affinity.
