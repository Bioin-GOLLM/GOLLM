Dopamine receptors control neural signals that modulates behavior. Dopamine 
plays an important role in normal attention; that is the reason for studying the 
genes of the dopaminergic system, mainly in connection with disorders of 
attention. DRD4 influences the postsynaptic action of dopamine and is implicated 
in many neurological processes, exhibits polymorphism and is one of the most 
studied genes in connection with psychiatric disorders. Associations were found 
with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), substance dependences, 
several specific personality traits, and reaction to stress. These findings have 
implications for pharmacogenetics. This article reviews the principle published 
associations of DRD4 variants with psychiatric disorders.
