PURPOSE: Cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) is required for retinal capillary 
degeneration in diabetic mice, a process mediated by the retinal endothelial 
cells (REC) death. However, CD40 activates prosurvival signals in endothelial 
cells. The purpose of this study was to identify a mechanism by which CD40 
triggers programmed cell death (PCD) of RECs and address this paradox.
METHODS: Human RECs and Müller cells were incubated with CD154 and 
L-N6-(1-Iminoethyl)lysine (L-Nil, nitric oxide synthase 2 inhibitor), α-lipoic 
acid (inhibitor of oxidative stress), anti-Fas ligand antibody, or A-438079 
(P2X7 adenosine triphosphate [ATP] receptor inhibitor). Programmed cell death 
was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or Hoechst/propidium 
iodide staining. Release of ATP was measured using a luciferase-based assay. 
Mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin. Expression of P2X7 was assessed by 
FACS, quantitative PCR, or immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Ligation of CD40 in primary RECs did not induce PCD. In contrast, in 
the presence of primary CD40+ Müller cells, CD40 stimulation caused PCD of RECs 
that was not impaired by L-Nil, α-lipoic acid, or anti-Fas ligand antibody. We 
found CD40 did not trigger TNF-α or IL-1β secretion. Primary Müller cells 
released extracellular ATP in response to CD40 ligation. Inhibition of P2X7 
(A-438079) impaired PCD of RECs; CD40 upregulated P2X7 in RECs, making them 
susceptible to ATP/P2X7-mediated PCD. Diabetic mice upregulated P2X7 in the 
retina and RECs in a CD40-dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Cluster of differentiation 40 induces PCD of RECs through a dual 
mechanism: ATP release by Müller cells and P2X7 upregulation in RECs. These 
findings are likely of in vivo relevance since CD40 upregulates P2X7 in RECs in 
diabetic mice and CD40 is known to be required for retinal capillary 
degeneration.
