BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing prevalence of Achromobacter xylosoxidans lung 
infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), its clinical pathogenicity 
remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects 
of this emerging bacterium on lung disease severity in CF children.
METHODS: This case-control retrospective study took place in two French 
paediatric CF centres. 45 cases infected by A. xylosoxidans were matched for 
age, sex, CFTR genotypes and pancreatic status to 45 never-infected controls. 
Clinical data were retrieved from clinical records over the 2 years before and 
after A. xylosoxidans initial infection.
RESULTS: At infection onset, lung function was lower in cases compared with 
controls (p=0.006). Over the 2 years prior to A. xylosoxidans acquisition, 
compared with controls, cases had more frequent pulmonary exacerbations 
(p=0.02), hospitalisations (p=0.05), and intravenous (p=0.03) and oral (p=0.001) 
antibiotic courses. In the 2 years following A. xylosoxidans infection, cases 
remained more severe with more frequent pulmonary exacerbations (p=0.0001), 
hospitalisations (p=0.0001), and intravenous (p=0.0001) and oral antibiotic 
courses (p=0.0001). Lung function decline tended to be faster in cases (-5.5% 
per year) compared with controls (-0.5% per year).
CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study demonstrates that A. xylosoxidans occurs 
more frequently in the patients with the worse lung disease. Further studies 
assessing the pathogenicity of this emerging pathogen and international 
treatment recommendations are warranted.
