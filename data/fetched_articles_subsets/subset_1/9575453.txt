In this pilot study the frequency of delta F508 mutation carriers, their 
geographic distribution, and the prevalence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Estonia 
were investigated. During the screening programme 7396 newborns were tested for 
delta F508 mutation and 88 were found to carry this deletion. The mean frequency 
of delta F508 mutation carriers in Estonia was thus estimated as 1 out of 84 
live births. In eight separate districts of Estonia the heterozygote frequencies 
differed significantly (p = 0.0369), with the highest incidence (1:36) on the 
Baltic Sea islands and western coastal region and with the lowest in south 
eastern parts of Estonia.
