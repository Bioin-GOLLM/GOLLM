RUNX1 encodes a RUNX family transcription factor (TF) and was recently 
identified as a novel mutated gene in human luminal breast cancers. We found 
that Runx1 is expressed in all subpopulations of murine mammary epithelial cells 
(MECs) except the secretory alveolar luminal cells. Conditional knockout of 
Runx1 in MECs by MMTV-Cre led to a decrease in luminal MECs, largely due to a 
profound reduction in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive mature luminal 
subpopulation, a phenotype that could be rescued by the loss of either Trp53 or 
Rb1. Mechanistically RUNX1 represses Elf5, a master regulatory TF gene for 
alveolar cells, and regulates mature luminal TF/co-factor genes (e.g., Foxa1 and 
Cited1) involved in the ER program. Collectively, our data identified a key 
regulator of the ER⁺ luminal lineage whose disruption may contribute to the 
development of ER⁺ luminal breast cancer when under the background of either 
TP53 or RB1 loss.
