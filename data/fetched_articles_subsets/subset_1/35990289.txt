OBJECTIVES: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal 
recessive diseases characterized by salt wasting or virilization. 21 hydroxylase 
deficiency (21-OHD) accounts for 90-95% of all cases of CAH and caused by the 
genetic defects of CYP21A2. Other forms include 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
deficiency, 11-β-hydroxylase deficiency (11β-OHD) (%5-8), 17-α-hydroxylase 
deficiency (17α-OHD), and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) defects 
(congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia) with mutations in HSD3B2, CYP11B1, 
CYP17A1, and STAR, respectively. Objectives: Herein, we aimed to present the 
clinical and genetic features of 64 patients with various types of CAH.
METHODS: Sixty-four patients with CAH, monitored in the Izmir Dr. Behcet Uz 
Children Hospital Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, were retrospectively 
analyzed for the clinical, laboratory, and genetic data.
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (87.5%) had 21-OHD and four patients (6.3%) had 
17α-OHD, three patients (4.7%) had 11β-OHD, and one patient (1.5%) had STAR 
defect. The most common presenting features in 21-OHD were ambiguous genitalia. 
Patients with 21-OHD were diagnosed earlier than the rare groups. 
Disease-causing variants of CYP21A2 were identified in 46 patients. The most 
common mutations were IVS2, Q318X, I172N, and large deletions. Three patients 
with 11β-OHD were presented with enlargement of penis and early pubic hair at 
the median presenting age of 26 months. 17α-OHD deficiency was detected in 4 
cases. Genetic analysis revealed two different homozygous CYP17A1 variants. The 
patient with STAR defect was presented with dehydration and cholestasis in 44 
days of the life. Genetic analysis of patient with STAR deficiency revealed a 
novel homozygous variant.
CONCLUSION: The current study reported a genotype-phenotype correlation 
consistent with literature data in CAH cases with 21-OHD. This study also 
reported novel homozygous variants in STAR and CYP17A1 genes that lead to rare 
types of CAH.
