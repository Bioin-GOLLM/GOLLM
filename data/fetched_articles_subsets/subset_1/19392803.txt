The novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Cw*0348 allele was identified by 
sequence-based typing in a Chinese family. This allele shows that the sequences 
of exons 1-3 of HLA-Cw*0348 are identical to those of HLA-Cw*030401 except for a 
nucleotide substitution that changes CCG to CTG at codon 57, resulting in an 
amino acid change from Pro to Leu in the protein, and this is a unique 
nucleotide change among the HLA-C alleles, suggesting a point mutation 
mechanism. The extended haplotype carrying the new allele was deduced from the 
family group typing and defined as A*110101, B*1301, Cw*0348, DRB1*0405, and 
DQB1*0402.
