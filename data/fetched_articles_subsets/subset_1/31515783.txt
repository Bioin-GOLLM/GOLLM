OBJECTIVE: To detect potential mutation in a Chinese pedigree affected with 
congenital limb malformations.
METHODS: Clinical data was collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral 
blood samples of family members. The zone of polarizing activity regulatory 
sequence (ZRS) were amplified by PCR and subjected to direct sequencing.
RESULTS: Among the 13 individuals in this pedigree, there were 4 PPD patients, 
who were characterized by varying degrees of deformity. The female patients 
suffered triphalangeal thumb and preaxial polydactyly, while the male patients 
only had preaxial polydactyly. Only one patient had foot involvement. TA 
heterogeneous mutations was discovered in the ZRS (105C>G) in all patients, the 
same mutation was not detected in 2 healthy family members.
CONCLUSION: The inheritance pattern of PPD was autosomal dominant inheritance. 
There was a significant variability of symptoms among family patients. The 
heterozygous mutation of the ZRS (105C>G) probably underlie the disease.
