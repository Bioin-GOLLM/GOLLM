BACKGROUND: Metabolic acidosis promotes cancer metastasis. No prospective 
studies have examined the association between dietary acid load and breast 
cancer recurrence among breast cancer survivors, who are susceptible to 
metabolic acidosis. Hyperglycemia promotes cancer progression and acid 
formation; however, researchers have not examined whether hyperglycemia can 
modify the association between dietary acid load and breast cancer recurrence.
METHODS: We studied 3081 early-stage breast cancer survivors enrolled in the 
Women's Healthy Eating and Living study who provided dietary information through 
24-h recalls at baseline and during follow-up and had measurements of hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) at baseline. We assessed dietary acid load using two common dietary 
acid load scores, potential renal acid load (PRAL) score and net endogenous acid 
production (NEAP) score.
RESULTS: After an average of 7.3 years of follow-up, dietary acid load was 
positively associated with recurrence when baseline HbA1c levels were ≥ 5.6% 
(median level) and ≥5.7% (pre-diabetic cut-point). In the stratum with HbA1c ≥ 
5.6%, comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of dietary acid load, the 
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio was 2.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
1.34-3.48) for PRAL and was 2.31 (95% CI 1.42-3.74) for NEAP. No associations 
were observed in the stratum with HbA1c levels were <5.6%. P-values for 
interactions were 0.01 for PRAL and 0.05 for NEAP.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated for the first time that even at or above 
normal to high HbA1c levels, dietary acid load was associated with increased 
risk of breast cancer recurrence among breast cancer survivors.
IMPACTS: Our study provides strong evidence for developing specific dietary acid 
load guidelines based on HbA1c levels.
