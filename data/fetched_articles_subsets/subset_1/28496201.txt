The clearance of apoptotic cells is an essential process for tissue homeostasis. 
To this end, cells undergoing apoptosis must display engulfment signals, such as 
'find-me' and 'eat-me' signals. Engulfment signals are recognized by multiple 
types of phagocytic machinery in phagocytes, leading to prompt clearance of 
apoptotic cells. In addition, apoptotic cells and phagocytes release tolerogenic 
signals to reduce immune responses against apoptotic cell-derived self-antigens. 
Here we discuss recent advances in our knowledge of engulfment signals, the 
phagocytic machinery and the signal transduction pathways for apoptotic cell 
engulfment.
