N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common mRNA modification and it plays a 
critical role in tumor progression, prognoses and therapeutic response. In 
recent years, more and more studies have shown that m6A modifications play an 
important role in bladder carcinogenesis and development. However, the 
regulatory mechanisms of m6A modifications are complex. Whether the m6A reading 
protein YTHDF1 is involved in the development of bladder cancer remains to be 
elucidated. The aims of this study were to determine the association between 
METTL3/YTHDF1 and bladder cancer cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance to 
explore the downstream target genes of METTL3/YTHDF1 and to explore the 
therapeutic implications for bladder cancer patients. The results showed that 
the reduced expression of METTL3/YTHDF1 could lead to decreased bladder cancer 
cell proliferation and cisplatin sensitivity. Meanwhile, overexpression of the 
downstream target gene, RPN2, could rescue the effect of reduced METTL3/YTHDF1 
expression on bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, this study proposes a novel 
METTL3/YTHDF1-RPN2-PI3K/AKT/mTOR regulatory axis that affects bladder cancer 
cell proliferation and cisplatin sensitivity.
