UBE2A-related X-linked intellectual disability is characterized by a distinctive 
facial phenotype (dense eyebrows and eyelashes, synophrys, hypertelorism, 
upslanted palpebral fissures, wide mouth, and thin lips), generalized hirsutism, 
hypoplastic genitalia, short stature, hypotonia, seizures, and severe 
intellectual disability. Five affected males in two families are described here 
and compared with the previously reported 17 males in eight families. The new 
cases are notable for the absence of nail dystrophy, previously considered a 
defining manifestation, and for the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia and 
adult-onset ataxia.
