Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) is a type II integral serine protease that 
is specifically expressed by activated fibroblasts. Cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor stroma have an abundant and stable expression of 
FAP, which plays an important role in promoting tumor growth, invasion, 
metastasis, and immunosuppression. For example, in females with a high incidence 
of breast cancer, CAFs account for 50-70% of the cells in the tumor's 
microenvironment. CAF overexpression of FAP promotes tumor development and 
metastasis by influencing extracellular matrix remodeling, intracellular 
signaling, angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and 
immunosuppression. This review discusses the basic biological characteristics of 
FAP and its applications in the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers. We 
review the emerging basic and clinical research data regarding the use of 
nanomaterials that target FAP.
