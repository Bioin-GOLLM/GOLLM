The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is the only known ubiquitin 
ligase for linear/Met1-linked ubiquitin chain formation. One of the LUBAC 
components, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL-1L), was recently shown 
to catalyse oxyester bond formation between ubiquitin and some substrates. 
However, oxyester bond formation in the context of LUBAC has not been directly 
observed. Here, we present the first 3D reconstruction of human LUBAC obtained 
by electron microscopy and report its generation of heterotypic ubiquitin chains 
containing linear linkages with oxyester-linked branches. We found that this 
event depends on HOIL-1L catalytic activity. By cross-linking mass spectrometry 
showing proximity between the catalytic RING-in-between-RING (RBR) domains, a 
coordinated ubiquitin relay mechanism between the HOIL-1-interacting protein 
(HOIP) and HOIL-1L ligases is suggested. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, these 
heterotypic chains were induced by TNF, which is reduced in cells expressing an 
HOIL-1L catalytic inactive mutant. In conclusion, we demonstrate that LUBAC 
assembles heterotypic ubiquitin chains by the concerted action of HOIP and 
HOIL-1L.
