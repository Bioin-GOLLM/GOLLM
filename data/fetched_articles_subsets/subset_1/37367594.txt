Candida auris, Candida blankii, and Kodamaea ohmeri have been regarded as 
emerging fungal pathogens that can cause infections with high mortality. For 
genotyping of C. auris, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on four 
locus sequences has been reported, while there is no typing scheme for C. 
blankii and K. ohmeri. In the present study, the existing MLST scheme of C. 
auris was modified by adding more locus types deduced from sequence data 
available in the GenBank database. Furthermore, MLST schemes of C. blankii and 
K. ohmeri were developed using the four cognate loci (ITS, RPB1, RPB2, D1/D2) 
and similar sequence regions to those of C. auris. These MLST schemes were 
applied to identify the ST (sequence type) of clinical isolates of C. auris (n = 
7), C. blankii (n = 9), and K. ohmeri (n = 6), derived from septicemia or 
otomycosis in Bangladesh in 2021. All the C. auris isolates were classified into 
a single ST (ST5) and clade I, having a Y132F substitution in ERG11p, which is 
associated with azole resistance. Similarly, all the C. blankii isolates 
belonged to a single type (ST1). In contrast, six K. ohmeri isolates were 
assigned to five types (ST1-ST5), suggesting its higher genetic diversity. These 
findings revealed the availability of MLST schemes for these three fungal 
species for understanding their clonal diversity among clinical isolates.
