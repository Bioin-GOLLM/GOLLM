BACKGROUND: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is one of the etiological 
pathogens implicated in the onset of periodontal disease. This pathogen produces 
cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that acts as a genotoxin to induce cell cycle 
arrest and cellular distension in cultured cell lines. Therefore, CDT is a 
possible virulence factor; however, the in vivo activity of CDT on periodontal 
tissue has not been explored. Here, CDT was topically applied into the rat molar 
gingival sulcus; and the periodontal tissue was histologically and 
immunohistochemically examined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant purified A. actinomycetemcomitans CDT was 
applied to gingival sulcus of male Wistar rats and tissue samples were 
immunohistochemmically examined.
RESULTS: One day after application, infiltration of neutrophils and dilation of 
blood vessels in the gingival connective tissue were found. At day three, 
desquamation and detachment of cells in the junctional epithelium was observed. 
This abrasion of junctional epithelium was not observed in rats treated with 
mutated CDT, in which a His274Ala mutation is present in the CdtB subunit. This 
indicates the tissue abrasion may be caused by the genotoxicity of CdtB. 
Expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker for 
proliferating cells, was significantly suppressed using CDT treatment in the 
junctional epithelium and gingival epithelium.
CONCLUSION: Using the rat model, these data suggest CDT intoxication induces 
cell cycle arrest and damage in periodontal epithelial cells in vivo.
