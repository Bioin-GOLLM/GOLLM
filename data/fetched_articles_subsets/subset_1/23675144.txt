The present study is aimed to determine the role of calcium signaling evoked by 
the oxygen radical, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the specific inhibitor of 
calcium reuptake thapsigargin on apoptosis in the human leukemia cell line 
HL-60. Our results show that treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 µM H2O2 and 1 µM 
thapsigargin induced a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium 
concentration ([Ca(2+)]c) due to calcium release from internal stores. These 
stimulatory effects on calcium signals were followed by activation of the 
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), as well as a time-dependent 
increase in caspase-9 and -3 activities. Our results also show that H2O2 and 
thapsigargin were able to increase the relative content of fragmented DNA and 
phosphatidylserine externalization, as detected by double-staining with 
propidium iodide (PI) and annexin-V-FITC, respectively. Treatment of cells with 
H2O2 or thapsigargin resulted in activation of the proapoptotic protein Bid. 
Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed active Bax was bound to 
Bid, which regulates Bid activity and promotes apoptosis. Our findings suggest 
that H2O2(-) and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis is dependent on rises in 
[Ca(2+)]c in human myeloid HL-60 cells.
