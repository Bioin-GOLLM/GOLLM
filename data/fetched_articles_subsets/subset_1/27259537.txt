Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of presumed hematopoietic 
origin showing morphologic and immunophenotypic evidence of histiocytic 
differentiation. Somatic mutation importance in the pathogenesis or disease 
progression of histiocytic sarcoma was largely unknown. To identify somatic 
mutations in histiocytic sarcoma, we studied 5 histiocytic sarcomas [3 female 
and 2 male patients; mean age 54.8 (20-72), anatomic sites include lymph node, 
uterus, and pleura] and matched normal tissues from each patient as germ line 
controls. Somatic mutations in 50 "Hotspot" oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes 
were examined using next generation sequencing. Three (out of five) histiocytic 
sarcoma cases carried somatic mutations in BRAF. Among them, G464V [variant 
frequency (VF) of 43.6 %] and G466R (VF of 29.6 %) located at the P loop 
potentially interfere with the hydrophobic interaction between P and activating 
loops and ultimately activation of BRAF. Also detected was BRAF somatic mutation 
N581S (VF of 7.4 %), which was located at the catalytic loop of BRAF kinase 
domain: its role in modifying kinase activity was unclear. A similar mutational 
analysis was also performed on nine acute monocytic/monoblastic leukemia cases, 
which did not identify any BRAF somatic mutations. Our study detected several 
BRAF mutations in histiocytic sarcomas, which may be important in understanding 
the tumorigenesis of this rare neoplasm and providing mechanisms for potential 
therapeutical opportunities.
