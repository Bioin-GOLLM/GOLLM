The breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) is involved in several 
important cellular pathways, including DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling 
and checkpoint activation. The BRCA1 tumor suppression function has been 
attributed to its role in homologous recombination damage repair. In this 
review, historical facts concerning BRCA1, together with recent research 
advances regarding our understanding of the BRCA1 interacting proteins that are 
involved in, homologous recombination (HR) double strand break (DBS) repair and 
how these interacting proteins maintain chromosomal integrity, are discussed. In 
addition, this review poses the questions as to what extent HR repair cannot be 
properly fulfilled when breast cancer related mutations in the BRCA1 gene occur 
and how the recent and excessive studied poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) 
inhibiting therapy approach links with the proposed tumor suppression function 
of the different BRCA1 domains.
