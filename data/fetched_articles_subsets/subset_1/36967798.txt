BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia and gout are risk factors of nephrolithiasis. However, 
it is unclear whether the ABCG2 gene contributes to the development of 
nephrolithiasis. We aimed to investigate the interaction between the ABCG2 
rs2231142 variant and incident nephrolithiasis in the Taiwanese population.
METHODS: A total of 120,267 adults aged 30-70 years were enrolled from the 
Taiwan Biobank data-base in this retrospective case-control study and genotyped 
for rs2231142. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported 
nephrolithiasis. The odds ratio (OR) of incident nephrolithiasis was analyzed by 
multivariable logistic regression models with adjustment for multifactorial 
confounding factors. Associations of the ABCG2 rs2231142 variant with serum uric 
acid levels, and the incident nephrolithiasis were explored.
RESULTS: The frequency of rs2231142 T allele was 53%, and 8,410 participants had 
nephrolithiasis. The multivariable-adjusted OR (95% confidence interval) of 
nephrolithiasis was 1.18 (1.09-1.28) and 1.12 (1.06-1.18) for TT and GT 
genotypes, respectively, compared with the GG genotype (p<0.001), specifically 
in the male population with hyperuricemia. Higher age, male sex, hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, smoking and overweight were 
independent risk factors for nephrolithiasis. In contrast, regular physical 
exercise is a protective factor against nephrolithiasis.
CONCLUSIONS: ABCG2 genetic variation is a significant risk of nephrolithiasis, 
independent of serum uric acid levels. For rs2231142 T allele carriers, our 
result provides evidence for precision healthcare to tackle hyperuricemia, 
comorbidities, smoking, and overweight, and recommend regular physical exercise 
for the prevention of nephrolithiasis.
