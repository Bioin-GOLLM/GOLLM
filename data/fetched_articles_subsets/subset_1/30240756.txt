Many xenobiotics can bind to off-target receptors and cause toxicity via the 
dysregulation of downstream transcription factors. Identification of subsequent 
off-target toxicity in these chemicals has often required extensive chemical 
testing in animal models. An alternative, integrated in vitro/in silico approach 
for predicting toxic off-target functional responses is presented to refine 
in vitro receptor identification and reduce the burden on in vivo testing. As 
part of the methodology, mathematical modeling is used to mechanistically 
describe processes that regulate transcriptional activity following 
receptor-ligand binding informed by transcription factor signaling assays. 
Critical reactions in the signaling cascade are identified to highlight 
potential perturbation points in the biochemical network that can guide and 
optimize additional in vitro testing. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
model provides information on the timing and localization of different levels of 
receptor activation informing whole-body toxic potential resulting from 
off-target binding.
