Maternal diet is an essential factor that directly and indirectly regulates 
fetal growth. Exposure to certain environmental conditions substantially impacts 
an individual's short- and long-term health. Adipose tissue dysfunction is a 
worldwide chronic disease caused by improper lipid build-up in adipose tissue 
leading to obesity. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to invent anti-obesity 
agents. As a keto-carotenoid, Astaxanthin (AsX) has been shown to have 
preventive effects against problems associated with obesity. A crucial role in 
the pathogenesis of obesity has been attributed to dietary polyunsaturated fatty 
acids. Adipose tissue plays a vital role in maintaining overall body 
homeostasis. Metabolic dysfunction of white adipocytes forms a critical step in 
the emergence of insulin resistance and related diseases. Here we aim to 
investigate the effect of AsX and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on 
the proteomic profile of perinatal undernutrition-induced adipose tissue 
dysfunction in adult life using a rat model. The LC-MS/MS quantitative 
proteomics enabled us to identify differentially expressed proteins in perinatal 
undernourished but AsX and DHA-supplemented animal models. Data are available 
via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD041772.This study explored biological 
roles, molecular functions of differentially expressed proteins, and pathways 
related to adipose tissue dysfunction induced by undernutrition and its 
effective modulation by AsX and DHA.
