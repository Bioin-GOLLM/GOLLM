Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 80% of lung cancer subtypes. 
Patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer may be considered for upfront 
surgical treatment. However, the overall 5-year survival rate is 59%. To improve 
survival, adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) was largely explored and showed an overall 
benefit of survival at 5 years < 7%. The evaluation of recurrence risk and 
subsequent need for ACT is only based on tumor stage (TNM classification); 
however, more than 25% of patients with stage IA/B tumors will relapse. 
Recently, adjuvant targeted therapy has been approved for EGFR-mutated resected 
NSCLC and trials are evaluating other targeted therapies and immunotherapies in 
adjuvant settings. Costs, treatment duration, emergence of resistant clones and 
side effects stress the need for a better selection of patients. The 
identification and validation of prognostic and theranostic markers to better 
stratify patients who could benefit from adjuvant therapies are needed. In this 
review, we report current validated clinical, pathological and molecular 
prognosis biomarkers that influence outcome in resected NSCLC, and we also 
describe molecular biomarkers under evaluation that could be available in daily 
practice to drive ACT in resected NSCLC.
