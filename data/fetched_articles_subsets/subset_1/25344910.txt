Radiation therapy is a staple treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, owing to 
the intrinsic radioresistance of pancreatic cancer cells, radiation therapy 
often fails to increase survival of pancreatic cancer patients. Radiation 
impedes cancer cells by inducing DNA damage, which can activate cell cycle 
checkpoints. Normal cells possess both a G1 and G2 checkpoint. However, cancer 
cells are often defective in G1 checkpoint due to mutations/alterations in key 
regulators of this checkpoint. Accordingly, our results show that normal 
pancreatic ductal cells respond to ionizing radiation (IR) with activation of 
both checkpoints whereas pancreatic cancer cells respond to IR with G2/M arrest 
only. Overexpression/hyperactivation of Rac1 GTPase is detected in the majority 
of pancreatic cancers. Rac1 plays important roles in survival and Ras-mediated 
transformation. Here, we show that Rac1 also plays a critical role in the 
response of pancreatic cancer cells to IR. Inhibition of Rac1 using specific 
inhibitor and dominant negative Rac1 mutant not only abrogates IR-induced G2 
checkpoint activation, but also increases radiosensitivity of pancreatic cancer 
cells through induction of apoptosis. These results implicate Rac1 signaling in 
the survival of pancreatic cancer cells following IR, raising the possibility 
that this pathway contributes to the intrinsic radioresistance of pancreatic 
cancer.
