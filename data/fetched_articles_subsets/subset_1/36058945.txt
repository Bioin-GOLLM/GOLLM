Advances in immune checkpoint and combination therapy have led to improvement in 
overall survival for patients with advanced melanoma. Improved understanding of 
the tumor, tumor microenvironment and tumor immune-evasion mechanisms has 
resulted in new approaches to targeting and harnessing the host immune response. 
Combination modalities with other immunotherapy agents, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy are also being explored to overcome resistance 
and to potentiate the immune response. In addition, novel approaches such as 
adoptive cell therapy, oncogenic viruses, vaccines and different strategies of 
drug administration including sequential, or combination treatment are being 
tested. Despite the progress in diagnosis of melanocytic lesions, correct 
classification of patients, selection of appropriate adjuvant and systemic 
theràapies, and prediction of response to therapy remain real challenges in 
melanoma. Improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment, tumor immunity 
and response to therapy has prompted extensive translational and clinical 
research in melanoma. There is a growing evidence that genomic and immune 
features of pre-treatment tumor biopsies may correlate with response in patients 
with melanoma and other cancers, but they have yet to be fully characterized and 
implemented clinically. Development of novel biomarker platforms may help to 
improve diagnostics and predictive accuracy for selection of patients for 
specific treatment. Overall, the future research efforts in melanoma 
therapeutics and translational research should focus on several aspects 
including: (a) developing robust biomarkers to predict efficacy of therapeutic 
modalities to guide clinical decision-making and optimize treatment regimens, 
(b) identifying mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to immune checkpoint 
inhibitors that are potentially actionable, (c) identifying biomarkers to 
predict therapy-induced adverse events, and (d) studying mechanism of actions of 
therapeutic agents and developing algorithms to optimize combination treatments. 
During the Melanoma Bridge meeting (December 2nd-4th, 2021, Naples, Italy) 
discussions focused on the currently approved systemic and local therapies for 
advanced melanoma and discussed novel biomarker strategies and advances in 
precision medicine as well as the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on management of 
melanoma patients.
