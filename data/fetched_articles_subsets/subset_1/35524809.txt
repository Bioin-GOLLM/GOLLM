PURPOSE: To investigate the associations of IMPDH and UGT1A9 polymorphisms with 
rejection in kidney transplant recipients taking mycophenolic acid (MPA).
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data, and the 
China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database were systematically searched 
for studies investigating the associations of IMPDH1, IMPDH2, and UGT1A9 
polymorphisms with rejection in kidney transplant recipients taking MPA. 
Associations were evaluated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and effect sizes (ESs) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the analysis, including a total of 2342 
kidney transplant recipients. The results showed that compared with the TC + CC 
variant genotypes, the TT genotype of IMPDH2 3757 T > C was significantly 
associated with a higher risk of rejection (ES = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.07-2.40, 
P = 0.021), while there was no significant association of the IMPDH2 3757 T > C 
polymorphism with acute rejection within 1 year in kidney transplant recipients 
(OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.79-2.80, P = 0.217; ES = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.88-2.36, 
P = 0.142). The GG genotypes of IMPDH1 125G > A and IMPDH1 106G > A were 
significantly associated with a higher risk of rejection (ES = 1.91, 95% 
CI = 1.11-3.28, P = 0.019) and acute rejection within 1 year (ES = 2.12, 95% 
CI = 1.45-3.10, P < 0.001) than the variant genotypes GA + AA. The TT genotype 
of UGT1A9 275 T > A showed a decreased risk of rejection compared with the 
variant genotypes TA + AA (ES = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.23-0.84, P = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: IMPDH1, IMPDH2, and UGT1A9 polymorphisms were associated with 
rejection in kidney transplant recipients, and the genetic backgrounds of 
patients should be considered when using MPA.
