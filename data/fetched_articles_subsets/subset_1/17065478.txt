PURPOSE: To identify the gene defect that causes blindness and the 
predisposition to embryonic death in the retinopathy globe enlarged (rge) 
chicken.
METHODS: Linkage analysis, with previously uncharacterized microsatellite 
markers from chicken chromosome 1, was performed on 138 progeny of an rge/+ and 
an rge/rge cross, and candidate genes were sequenced.
RESULTS: The rge locus was refined and the gene for guanine nucleotide-binding 
protein beta-3 (GNB3), which encodes a cone transducin beta subunit, was found 
to have a 3-bp deletion (D153del) that segregated with the rge phenotype. This 
mutation deleted a highly conserved aspartic acid residue in the third of seven 
WD domains in GNB3. In silico modeling suggested that this mutation destabilized 
the protein. Furthermore, a 70% reduction was found in immunoreactivity to 
anti-GNB3 in the rge-affected retina.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate the beta-subunit of cone transducin as the 
defective protein underlying the rge phenotype. Furthermore, GNB3 is 
ubiquitously expressed, and the c.825C-->T GNB3 splicing variant (MIM 139130) 
has been associated with hypertension, obesity, diabetes, low birth weight, 
coronary heart disease, and stroke in the human population. It therefore seems 
likely that the defect underlying these human diseases also causes reduced 
embryonic viability in the rge chicken, making it a powerful model for studying 
the pathology involved in these associations.
