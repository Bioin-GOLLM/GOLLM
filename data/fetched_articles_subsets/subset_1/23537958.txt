Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a birnavirus that causes 
immunosuppressive disease in chickens. The emergence of very virulent IBDV 
(vvIBDV) has brought new challenges for this disease. The molecular determinants 
for the high pathogenicity of vvIBDV are not fully understood. Previous studies 
focused mostly on the VP2 protein on segment A, but recent evidence suggests 
that segment B also plays an important role. Previously we identified eight 
amino acid changes in the VP1 protein of vvIBDV. In this study, we investigated 
effect of amino acids substitutions in VP1 on viral replication and 
pathogenicity. We identified a Valine to Isoleucine substitution at amino acid 
position 4 (V4I) of VP1 that attenuates viral pathogenicity and reduces viral 
replication in SPF chickens but increases viral replication in CEF cells. This 
study confirms that VP1 of segment B play an important role in viral replication 
and pathogenicity of vvIBDV.
