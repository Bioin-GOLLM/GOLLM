In this study we describe the development of peptidomimetic analogs of the 
potent vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor binding inhibitor, Leu(1) -Met(2) 
-Tyr(3) -Pro(4) -Thr(5) -Tyr(6) -Leu(7) -Lys(8) -OH 1, by incorporating furanoid 
sugar amino acids (SAAs) 2-4 into the molecule. The furanoid SAAs 2-4 were used 
as dipeptide isosteres to replace Tyr(3) -Pro(4) or Pro(4) -Thr(5) in sequence 
1. The resulting analogs 5-9 were tested for their anti-cancer activities in 
vitro, following the standard MTT assay on a panel of human cancer cell lines. 
One of the potent analogs, 6a was tested in vivo for tumor regression on primary 
colon tumor xenografted nude mice. Our experimental results suggest that many of 
these analogs show either retention or enhancement of biological activity.
