The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a master regulator of developmental 
cell-fate decisions, although the key target pathways are poorly characterized. 
Here, we interrogated the contribution of the SWI/SNF subunit and tumor 
suppressor SNF5 to the regulation of developmental pathways using conditional 
mouse and cell culture models. We find that loss of SNF5 phenocopies β-catenin 
hyperactivation and that SNF5 is essential for regulating Wnt/β-catenin pathway 
target expression. These data provide insight into chromatin-based mechanisms 
that underlie developmental regulation and elucidate the emerging theme that 
mutation of this tumor suppressor complex can activate developmental pathways by 
uncoupling them from upstream control.
