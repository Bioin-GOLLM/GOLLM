Mutations in human copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause an inherited 
form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inclusions enriched in pathogenic 
SOD1 accumulate in the spinal cords of transgenic mice expressing these 
proteins, but endogenous mouse SOD1 is not found as a component of these 
aggregates. In the accompanying paper, Karch and colleagues analyze aggregation 
propensities of human/mouse SOD1 chimeras in cell culture and identify two 
sequence elements in the human enzyme that seem to enhance its aggregation 
relative to the mouse enzyme. Here, we report the first structure of mouse SOD1 
along with those of SOD1 chimeras in which residues 1-80 come from human SOD1 
and residues 81-153 come from mouse SOD1 and vice versa. Taken together, the 
structural and cell-based data suggest a model in which residues Q42 and Q123 in 
mouse SOD1 modulate non-native SOD1-SOD1 intermolecular interactions at edge 
strands in the SOD1 Greek key β-barrel.
