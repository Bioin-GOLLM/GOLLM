Hippocampal "time cells" encode specific moments of temporally organized 
experiences that may support hippocampal functions for episodic memory. However, 
little is known about the reorganization of the temporal representation of time 
cells during changes in temporal structures of episodes. We investigated CA1 
neuronal activity during temporal bisection tasks, in which the sets of time 
intervals to be discriminated were designed to be extended or contracted across 
the blocks of trials. Assemblies of neurons encoded elapsed time during the 
interval, and the representation was scaled when the set of interval times was 
varied. Theta phase precession and theta sequences of time cells were also 
scalable, and the fine temporal relationships were preserved between pairs in 
theta cycles. Moreover, theta sequences reflected the rats' decisions on the 
basis of their time estimation. These findings demonstrate that scalable 
features of time cells may support the capability of flexible temporal 
representation for memory formation.
