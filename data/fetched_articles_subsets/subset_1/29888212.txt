Tuberculosis is a severe contagious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mtb). To develop new vaccines and medicine against TB, there is an urgent need 
to provide insights into the mechanisms by which Mtb induces tuberculosis. In 
this study, we found that secreted Mtb virulence factor MptpB significantly 
enhanced the survival of H37Rv in macrophages. MptpB suppressed the production 
of iNOS, the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β and IL-6, as well as the 
apoptosis of the macrophage in Mtb infected RAW264.7 cells. Mechanism 
investigation showed that MptpB simultaneously hampered the NF-κB and MAPK 
signal pathways, evidenced by its blocking of p65, IKKα, Erk1/2, and p38 
phosphorylation induced by Mtb infection. MptpB also inhibited host cell p53 
expression. The results demonstrated that MptpB contributed to the survival of 
H37Rv by inhibiting host inflammatory responses and apoptosis through impeding 
the NF-κB and MAPK signal pathways and p53 expression in the macrophage.
