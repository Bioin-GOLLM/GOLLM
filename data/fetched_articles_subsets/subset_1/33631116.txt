Point mutations within the histone H3.3 are frequent in aggressive childhood 
brain tumors known as pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs). Intriguingly, 
distinct mutations arise in discrete anatomical regions: H3.3-G34R within the 
forebrain and H3.3-K27M preferentially within the hindbrain. The reasons for 
this contrasting etiology are unknown. By engineering human fetal neural stem 
cell cultures from distinct brain regions, we demonstrate here that 
cell-intrinsic regional identity provides differential responsiveness to each 
mutant that mirrors the origins of pHGGs. Focusing on H3.3-G34R, we find that 
the oncohistone supports proliferation of forebrain cells while inducing a 
cytostatic response in the hindbrain. Mechanistically, H3.3-G34R does not impose 
widespread transcriptional or epigenetic changes but instead impairs recruitment 
of ZMYND11, a transcriptional repressor of highly expressed genes. We therefore 
propose that H3.3-G34R promotes tumorigenesis by focally stabilizing the 
expression of key progenitor genes, thereby locking initiating forebrain cells 
into their pre-existing immature state.
