Skp1 is an essential adaptor protein of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein complex and 
is able to stabilize the conformation of some ubiquitin E3 ligases. However, the 
role Skp1 plays during tumorigenesis remains unclear and Skp1-targeting agent is 
lacking. Here we showed that Skp1 was overexpressed in 36/64 (56.3%) of 
non-small cell lung cancers, and elevated Skp1 was associated with poor 
prognosis. By structure-based high-throughput virtual screening, we found some 
Skp1-targeting molecules including a natural compound 6-O-angeloylplenolin 
(6-OAP). 6-OAP bound Skp1 at sites critical to Skp1-Skp2 interaction, leading to 
dissociation and proteolysis of oncogenic E3 ligases NIPA, Skp2, and Î²-TRCP, and 
accumulation of their substrates Cyclin B1, P27 and E-Cadherin. 6-OAP induced 
prometaphase arrest and exerted potent anti-lung cancer activity in two murine 
models and showed low adverse effect. These results indicate that Skp1 is 
critical to lung cancer pathogenesis, and Skp1 inhibitor inactivates crucial 
oncogenic E3 ligases and exhibits significant therapeutic potentials.
