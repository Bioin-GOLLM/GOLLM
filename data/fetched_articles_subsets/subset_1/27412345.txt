OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the role of MMP-1 (-1607 
1G/2G; -519 A/G) and MMP-2 (-1306 C/T; -735 C/T) polymorphisms in the 
development and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 
Tunisian patients. We also evaluated the impact of these genetic variants on 
serum levels of the corresponding proteins.
METHODS: The study included 138 patients with COPD and 216 healthy controls. 
Pulmonary function was evaluated using body plethysmography, and COPD severity 
was determined based on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%). MMP-1 and MMP-2 
variants were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), while serum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and 
-2 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 
activity of MMP-2 was determined by gelatin zymography.
RESULTS: No significant associations were found between genetic variations in 
MMP-1 and MMP-2 variants and the risk of development of COPD. Additionally, no 
significant impact of the MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G; -519 A/G) and MMP-2 (-735 C/T) 
polymorphisms was observed on the respective protein levels and clinical 
parameters of the disease. Interestingly, a significant correlation was 
identified between the MMP-2 (-1306) C/T and disease severity [p = 0.01; 
Bonferroni corrected p value (p c) = 0.04]. Increased levels of MMP-2 were also 
identified in patients with the MMP-2 (-1306) CC genotype compared with those 
with CT and TT genotypes (105 [84.69-121.5] vs. 86.29 [80.99-92.62] ng/ml; 
p = 0.01, p c = 0.04). Additionally, MMP-2 activity was enhanced in patients 
carrying the CC genotype compared with those carrying the T variant (p = 0.01, p 
c = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, although MMP-1 (-1607 1G/2G; -519 A/G) and 
MMP-2 (-735 C/T) may not affect COPD risk and clinical parameters, the MMP-2 
(-1306C/T) variant was correlated to COPD severity. These findings could be 
related to alterations in the level and activity of MMP-2 in serum from patients 
carrying the (-1306) CC genotype.
