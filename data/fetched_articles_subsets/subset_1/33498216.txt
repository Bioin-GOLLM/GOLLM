Polyphenols represent a group of secondary metabolites of plants which have been 
analyzed as potent regulators of multiple biological processes, including cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy, among others. These natural compounds 
exhibit beneficial effects and protection against inflammation, oxidative 
stress, and related injuries including metabolic diseases, such as 
cardiovascular damage, obesity and diabetes, and neurodegeneration. This review 
aims to summarize the mechanisms of action of polyphenols in relation to the 
activation of autophagy, stimulation of mitochondrial function and antioxidant 
defenses, attenuation of oxidative stress, and reduction in cell apoptosis, 
which may be responsible of the health promoting properties of these compounds.
