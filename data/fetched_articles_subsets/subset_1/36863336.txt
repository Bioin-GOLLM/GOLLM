The transplanting islets to the liver approach suffers from an immediate 
posttransplant loss of islets of more than 50%, progressive graft dysfunction 
over time, and precludes recovery of grafts should there be serious 
complications such as the development of teratomas with grafts that are stem 
cell-derived islets (SC-islets). The omentum features an attractive extrahepatic 
alternative site for clinical islet transplantation. We explore an approach in 
which allogeneic islets are transplanted onto the omentum, which is 
bioengineered with a plasma-thrombin biodegradable matrix in three diabetic 
non-human primates (NHPs). Within 1 week posttransplant, each transplanted NHP 
achieves normoglycemia and insulin independence and remains stable until 
termination of the experiment. Success was achieved in each case with islets 
recovered from a single NHP donor. Histology demonstrates robust 
revascularization and reinnervation of the graft. This preclinical study can 
inform the development of strategies for β cell replacement including the use of 
SC-islets or other types of novel cells in clinical settings.
