PURPOSE: To report the outcome of unilateral small incision lenticule extraction 
(SMILE) in a patient with granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2).
METHODS: Slit-lamp photography and Fourier domain optical coherence tomography 
were used to document the clinical course and appearance of the corneas in a 
patient with genetically determined GCD2 who underwent unilateral SMILE in the 
right eye.
RESULTS: Slit-lamp examination of a 23-year-old woman revealed 2 faint opacities 
at the surgical interface approximately 2 months after the SMILE procedure had 
been performed on her right eye. Nine and 3 typical GCD2 deposits located 
immediately beneath the Bowman layer were observed in the right and left 
corneas, respectively. Over time, the deposits at the interface increased in 
size, density, and number in the right eye. Fourier domain optical coherence 
tomography performed 33 months after the SMILE procedure revealed deposits at 
the SMILE interface that were distinct from those located immediately beneath 
the Bowman layer. The severity of disease exacerbation was less in this patient 
than what is typically observed in others who have undergone laser-assisted in 
situ keratomileusis or photorefractive keratectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: SMILE is contraindicated in patients with GCD2, as are other 
corneal refractive surgical procedures. This case highlights the importance of 
genetic testing before the performance of refractive corneal 
procedures-especially for patients with corneal opacities on preoperative 
slit-lamp examination or a family history of corneal disease compatible with 
that of a corneal dystrophy.
