BACKGROUND: During the pandemic outbreak of the 2009 swine influenza 
(A(H1N1)pdm09), 32 fatal cases occurred in Norway and 19 of these were included 
in this study.
OBJECTIVES: We characterised pulmonary changes in these fatal Norwegian cases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Upon hospitalisation, detailed clinical information and 
specimens from the upper and lower respiratory pathways were collected. At 
post-mortem, lung tissue was collected, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. 
Immunohistochemical and light microscopic examination was performed to visualise 
the local expression of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and pyrosequencing of the non-fixed specimens allowed 
the identification of mutations in the influenza virus surface glycoprotein 
(haemagglutinin gene) particularly at position 222.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The overall course of illness lasted from 2 to 40 days 
(median 9 days). Diffused alveolar damage (DAD) was evident in 11 cases, 4 of 
which had no apparent underlying illness. Obesity was prominent in 12 cases, 
where three individuals were classified as otherwise healthy. The HA D222G 
mutation was detected in six cases, 3 of which had no underlying illness. 
Immunohistochemistry showed the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus to be prominent at the site 
of inflammation both in close proximity to and inside alveolar structures in the 
lung tissue. In addition to a possible role for the HA D222G mutation, our 
findings indicate that host factors and underlying conditions in the infected 
individuals are fundamental for disease outcome in many cases. This study 
increases our understanding of determinants for the clinical outcome of pandemic 
influenza, which could guide future treatment.
