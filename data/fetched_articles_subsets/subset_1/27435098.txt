Protein secretion and membrane insertion occur through the ubiquitous Sec 
machinery. In this system, insertion involves the targeting of translating 
ribosomes via the signal recognition particle and its cognate receptor to the 
SecY (bacteria and archaea)/Sec61 (eukaryotes) translocon. A common mechanism 
then guides nascent transmembrane helices (TMHs) through the Sec complex, 
mediated by associated membrane insertion factors. In bacteria, the membrane 
protein 'insertase' YidC ushers TMHs through a lateral gate of SecY to the 
bilayer. YidC is also thought to incorporate proteins into the membrane 
independently of SecYEG. Here, we show the bacterial holo-translocon (HTL) - a 
supercomplex of SecYEG-SecDF-YajC-YidC - is a bona fide resident of the 
Escherichia coli inner membrane. Moreover, when compared with SecYEG and YidC 
alone, the HTL is more effective at the insertion and assembly of a wide range 
of membrane protein substrates, including those hitherto thought to require only 
YidC.
