Canonical Wnt (Wingless/Integrated) signaling is crucial in bone development and 
the Wnt ligand can promote osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal 
progenitor cells. Calcitriol, an active vitamin D3, is used clinically for 
treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) patients. The bone effects of calcitriol in SHPT remains uncertain. We 
hypothesized that calcitriol improves bone mass by suppressing osteoclast 
activity, and simultaneously promoting Wnt ligand secretion. We designed a 
cross-sectional study in maintenance hemodialysis patients to explore the 
effects of calcitriol on different bone turnover markers and specifically 
emphasized the Wnt 10b levels. Then, we explored the source of Wnt 10b secretion 
by using osteoclasts and osteoblasts treated with calcitriol in cell culture 
studies. Finally, we explored the effects of calcitriol on bone 
microarchitectures in CKD mice, using the 5/6 nephrectomy CKD animal model with 
analysis using micro-computed tomography. Calcitriol promoted the growth of both 
trabecular and cortical bones in the CKD mice. Wnt 10b and Procollagen 1 
N-terminal Propeptide (P1NP) significantly increased, but Tartrate-resistant 
acid phosphatase 5b (Trap 5b) significantly decreased in the calcitriol-treated 
maintenance hemodialysis patients. Calcitriol enhanced Wnt 10b secretion from 
osteoclasts in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of SHPT with calcitriol 
improved the bone anabolism by inhibiting osteoclasts and promoting osteoblasts 
that might be achieved by increasing the Wnt 10b level.
