In this study, the separation properties of Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 
hollow fiber hemodialysis membranes were improved by optimizing membrane 
morphology and structure. The results showed that the PVDF membrane had better 
mechanical and separation properties than Fresenius Polysulfone High-Flux (F60S) 
membrane. The PVDF membrane tensile stress at break, tensile elongation and 
bursting pressure were 11.3 MPa, 395% and 0.625 MPa, respectively. 
Ultrafiltration (UF) flux of pure water reached 108.2 L∙h-1∙m-2 and rejection of 
Albumin from bovine serum was 82.3%. The PVDF dialyzers were prepared by 
centrifugal casting. The influences of membrane area and simulate fluid flow 
rate on dialysis performance were investigated. The results showed that the 
clearance rate of urea and Lysozyme (LZM) were improved with increasing membrane 
area and fluid flow rate while the rejection of albumin from bovine serum (BSA) 
had little influence. The high-flux PVDF dialyzer UF coefficient reached 62.6 
mL/h/mmHg. The PVDF dialyzer with membrane area 0.69 m2 has the highest 
clearance rate to LZM and urea. The clearance rate of LZM was 66.8% and urea was 
87.7%.
