The complex of sensory rhodopsin II (NpSRII) with its cognate transducer 
(NpHtrII) mediates negative phototaxis in halobacteria Natronomonas pharaonis. 
Upon light activation NpSRII triggers, by means of NpHtrII, a signal 
transduction chain homologous to the two component system in eubacterial 
chemotaxis. Here we report on the crystal structure of the ground state of the 
mutant NpSRII-D75N/NpHtrII complex in the space group I212121. Mutations of this 
aspartic acid in light-driven proton pumps dramatically modify or/and inhibit 
protein functions. However, in vivo studies show that the similar D75N mutation 
retains functionality of the NpSRII/NpHtrII complex. The structure provides the 
molecular basis for the explanation of the unexpected observation that the wild 
and the mutant complexes display identical physiological response on light 
excitation.
