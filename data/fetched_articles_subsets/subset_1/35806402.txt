There is evidence that the concomitance of psoriasis and obesity may originate 
from the interplay between multiple genetic pathways and involve gene−gene 
interactions. The aim of this study was to compare the genetic background 
related to obesity among psoriatic patients versus healthy controls by means of 
a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). A total of 972 psoriatic patients and a 
total of 5878 healthy donors were enrolled in this study. DNA samples were 
genotyped for over 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using Infinium 
CoreExome BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical analysis 
identified eleven signals (p < 1 × 10−5) associated with BMI across the study 
groups and revealed a varying effect size in each sub-cohort. Seven of the 
alternative alleles (rs1558902 in the FTO gene, rs696574 in the CALCRL gene, as 
well as rs10968110, rs4551082, rs4609724, rs9320269, and rs2338833,) are 
associated with increased BMI among all psoriatic patients and four (rs1556519 
in the ITLN2 gene, rs12972098 in the AC003006.7 gene, rs12676670 in the PAG1 
gene, and rs1321529) are associated with lower BMI. The results of our study may 
lead to further insights into the understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity 
among psoriatic patients.
