The product of the sopB gene on the Escherichia coli F-plasmid has been shown to 
silence genes in the vicinity of its binding region, sopC, when overexpressed. 
We searched for mutants defective in SopB-dependent silencing by screening for a 
plasmid incompatibility phenotype, in order to examine the relationship between 
gene silencing and the intracellular localization of SopB, as revealed by a 
green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SopB fusion. Nine new mutants were isolated. One 
of them, in which leucine 92 is replaced by proline, was completely compatible 
with a sopC-carrying plasmid and was defective in other silencing activities. 
When expressed as a GFP fusion protein, the L92P mutant was found to be 
uniformly distributed in the cell. This implies a link between silencing and 
SopB localization, supporting the view that a high local concentration of SopB 
drives non-specific DNA binding in segments of the plasmid adjacent to sopC. 
Despite the lack of apparent localization of GFP fluorescence, the mutant 
protein, like the wild-type SopB, was found mostly in the inner membrane 
fraction, indicating that the association with the inner membrane was retained.
