INTRODUCTION: RHPN2, a member of rhophilin family of rho-binding proteins, 
regulates actin cytoskeleton and vesicular trafficking, and promotes mesenchymal 
transformation in cancer. We have found that RHPN2 was significantly mutated in 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, the role of RHPN2 in lung cancer is not 
fully understood.
METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the expression of RHPN2 in 125 
patients with LUAD by qRT-PCR and correlated its expression with clinical 
characteristics. The effects of RHPN2 on the proliferation and invasion of lung 
cancer cells were determined by CCK-8 and in vitro transwell assays, clonogenic 
assay, and xenograft mouse model. The RhoA pull down assay and Western blotting 
were performed to elucidate the mechanism of RNPN2 in tumorigenesis of lung 
cancer.
RESULTS: RHPN2 was overexpressed in tumors from LUAD, and high levels of RHPN2 
were associated with poor prognosis of LUAD patients. RHPN2 was required for 
proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells. Intriguingly, overexpression of 
RHPN2 conferred the resistance to glutamine depletion in lung cancer cells. 
Mechanistic studies revealed that ectopic overexpression of RHPN2 promoted the 
stability of c-Myc protein via phosphorylation at Ser62 and increased c-Myc 
target glutamine synthetase (GS). Analysis of GS expression in clinical sample 
showed that the expression of GS was elevated in tumor cells. Kaplan-Meier 
analysis revealed that high levels of GS were significantly associated with 
worse overall survival time of the patients with LUAD.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this study suggested that RHPN2 was involved in 
tumorigenesis of lung cancer via modulating c-Myc stability and the expression 
of its target GS in lung adenocarcinoma, which links RHPN2 and glutamine 
metabolism.
