Ethnically specific data on genetic variation are crucial for understanding 
human biology and for clinical interpretation of variant pathogenicity. We 
analyzed data obtained by deep sequencing 1303 Korean whole exomes; the data 
were generated by three independent whole exome sequencing projects (named the 
KOEX study). The primary focus of this study was to comprehensively analyze the 
variant statistics, investigate secondary findings that may have clinical 
actionability, and identify loci that should be cautiously interpreted for 
pathogenicity. A total of 495 729 unique variants were identified at exonic 
regions, including 169 380 nonsynonymous variants and 4356 frameshift 
insertion/deletions. Among these, 76 607 were novel coding variants. On average, 
each individual had 7136 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants and 74 
frameshift insertion/deletions. We classified 13 pathogenic and 13 likely 
pathogenic variants in 56 genes that may have clinical actionability according 
to the guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and 
the Association for Molecular Pathology. The carrier frequency of these 26 
variants was 2.46% (95% confidence interval 1.73-3.46). To identify loci that 
require cautious interpretation in clinical sequencing, we identified 18 genes 
that are prone to sequencing errors, and 671 genes that are highly polymorphic 
and carry excess nonsynonymous variants. The catalog of identified variants, its 
annotation and frequency information are publicly available 
(http://koex.snu.ac.kr). These findings should be useful resources for 
investigating ethnically specific characteristics in human health and disease.
