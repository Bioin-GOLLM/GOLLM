The synthesis of compounds 6, 7a,b, 8a,b, 9a,b, and 10a,b where the amino -NH- 
group of JDTic (3) was replaced with an aromatic horizontal lineCH-, CH(2), O, 
S, or SO group was accomplished and used to further characterize the SAR of the 
compound 3 class of kappa opioid receptor antagonists. All of the compounds 
showed subnanomolar to low nanomolar K(e) values at the kappa opioid receptor. 
The most potent compound was 7a, where the amino -NH- group of 3 was replaced by 
a methylene (-CH(2)-) group. This compound had a K(e) = 0.18 nM and was 37- and 
248-fold selective for the kappa relative to the mu and delta opioid receptors, 
respectively. Similar to compound 3, compound 7a antagonized selective kappa 
agonist U50,488-induced diuresis after sc administration in rats. In contrast to 
3, where kappa antagonist activity lasted for three weeks, compound 7a did not 
show any kappa antagonist activity after one week.
