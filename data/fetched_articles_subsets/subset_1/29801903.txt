BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a movement disorder with high clinical and genetic 
heterogeneity. Molecular diagnosis is important for an accurate diagnosis of 
dystonia. Targeted gene capture sequencing has been an effective method for 
screening multiple candidate genes simultaneously. This method, however, has 
been rarely reported to be used with dystonia patients.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To assess the effectiveness of the targeted gene capture 
sequencing in dystonia, we performed custom target gene capture followed by 
next-generation sequencing in dystonia patients from China. Sanger sequencing 
was utilized to substantiate the findings. The effects of identified variants 
were classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics (ACMG) standards and guidelines.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients (34 female and 31 male) were recruited in this 
study. The mean age at onset was 22.7 ± 13.3 years ranging from 2 to 59 years. 
According to ACMG standards and guidelines, of 65 patients, 12 were identified 
with pathogenic variants (12/65, 18.5%) in gene TOR1A, PANK2 or ATP1A3, and 
another four were identified with likely-pathogenic variants (4/65, 6.2%) in 
gene PRRT2, GCH1 or THAP1. In total, 24.6% of patients in this cohort were 
detected to have a genetic cause of dystonia. Another four patients (4/65, 6.2%) 
were identified with variants which were considered to be VUS (Variants of 
Uncertain Significance) in gene SGCE, TH, ANO3 and ATP1A3 respectively. The most 
common detected gene was TOR1A, known to be causative for DYT1 (8/65, 12.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that targeted gene capture sequencing is an 
effective tool for identifying the genetic cause of heterogeneous dystonia 
patients.
