BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) consists of a clinically 
and neuropathologically heterogeneous group of syndromes affecting the frontal 
and temporal lobes of the brain. Mutations in microtubule-associated protein tau 
(MAPT), progranulin (PGRN) and charged multi-vesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) 
are associated with familial forms of the disease. The prevalence of these 
mutations varies between populations. The H1 haplotype of MAPT has been found to 
be closely associated with tauopathies and with sporadic FTLD. Our aim was to 
investigate MAPT mutations and haplotype frequencies in a clinical series of 
patients with FTLD in Northern Finland.
METHODS: MAPT exons 1, 2 and 9-13 were sequenced in 59 patients with FTLD, and 
MAPT haplotypes were analysed in these patients, 122 patients with early onset 
Alzheimer's disease (eoAD) and 198 healthy controls.
RESULTS: No pathogenic mutations were found. The H2 allele frequency was 11.0% 
(P = 0.028) in the FTLD patients, 9.8% (P = 0.029) in the eoAD patients and 5.3% 
in the controls. The H2 allele was especially clustered in patients with a 
positive family history (P = 0.011) but did not lower the age at onset of the 
disease. The ApoE4 allele frequency was significantly increased in the patients 
with eoAD and in those with FTLD.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that although pathogenic MAPT mutations are rare in 
Northern Finland, the MAPT H2 allele may be associated with increased risks of 
FTLD and eoAD in the Finnish population.
