Myostatin (GDF8) acts as a negative regulator of muscle growth. Mutations in the 
gene are responsible for the double muscling phenotype in several European 
cattle breeds. Here we describe the sequence of the upstream 5' region of the 
myostatin gene. The sequence analysis was carried out on three animals of nine 
European cattle breeds, with the aim to search for polymorphisms. A T/A 
polymorphism at -371 and a G/C polymorphism at -805 (relative to ATG) were 
found. PCR- RFLP was used to further screen 353 animals of the nine breeds 
studied and to assess the frequencies of the SNPs. The promoter region of the 
gene contains several binding sites for transcription factors found also in 
other myogenic genes. This may play an important role in the regulation of the 
protein and consequently on muscular development.
