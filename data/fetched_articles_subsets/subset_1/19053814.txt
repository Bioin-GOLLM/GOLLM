Incorporation of enediynes into anticancer drugs remains an intriguing yet 
elusive strategy for the design of therapeutically active agents. Density 
functional theory was used to locate reactants, products, and transition states 
along the Bergman cyclization pathways connecting enediynes to reactive 
para-biradicals. Sum method correction to low-level calculations confirmed 
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) as the method of choice in investigating enediynes. Herein 
described as MI:Sum, calculated reaction enthalpies differed from experiment by 
an average of 2.1 kcal x mol(-1) (mean unsigned error). A combination of strain 
energy released across the reaction coordinate and the critical intramolecular 
distance between reacting diynes explains reactivity differences. Where 
experimental and calculated barrier heights are in disagreement, higher level 
multireference treatment of the enediynes confirms lower level estimates. 
Previous work concerning the chemically reactive fragment of esperamcin, MTC, is 
expanded to our model system MTC2.
