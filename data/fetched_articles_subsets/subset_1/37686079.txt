Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid tumor 
malignancies in the world and represents roughly 90% of all primary malignancies 
of the liver. The most common risk factors for HCC include hepatitis B virus, 
hepatitis C virus, alcohol, and increasingly, fatty liver. Most HCC is diagnosed 
at advanced stages, excluding the possibility of curative resection, which 
leaves systemic therapy as the only treatment option. However, given the extreme 
mutational diversity and heterogenous nature of HCC, efforts to develop new 
targeted systemic therapies were largely unsuccessful until recently. HCC 
pathogenesis is thought to be a multistage process driven by a wide array of 
nonmutually exclusive driver mutations accompanied by many passenger mutations, 
with the average tumor possessing approximately 40 genomic aberrations. Over the 
past two decades, several efforts to categorize HCC prognostically and 
therapeutically according to different molecular subclassifications with the 
intent to guide treatment and identify drug targets have emerged, though, no 
single consensus has been reached. Recent breakthroughs in drug development have 
greatly expanded treatment options, but the ideal of uniting each patient's 
unique HCC with a targeted systemic therapy remains elusive.
