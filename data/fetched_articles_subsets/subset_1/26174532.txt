The therapeutic landscape for advanced melanoma has expanded in recent years. 
This expansion has largely been driven by investigational work in melanoma tumor 
biology and immunology that has been successfully translated to the clinical 
setting. Molecular evidence generated through benchside experimentation 
identified BRAF and MEK as key molecular targets in melanoma. This commentary 
will highlight this work and provide a rationale for the continued importance of 
translational work in the field of targeted melanoma therapies.
