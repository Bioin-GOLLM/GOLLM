RALA and RALB are highly homologous small G proteins belonging to the RAS 
superfamily. Like other small GTPases, the RALs are molecular switches that can 
be toggled between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states to regulate 
diverse and critical cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking, filopodia 
formation, mitochondrial fission, and cytokinesis. The RAL paralogs are 
activated and inactivated by a shared set of guanine nucleotide exchange factors 
(GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and utilize similar sets of 
downstream effectors. In addition to their important roles in normal cell 
biology, the RALs are known to be critical mediators of cancer cell survival, 
invasion, migration, and metastasis. However, despite their substantial 
similarities, the RALs often display striking functional disparities in cancer. 
RALA and RALB can have redundant, unique, or even antagonistic functions 
depending on cancer type. The molecular basis for these discrepancies remains an 
important unanswered question in the field of cancer biology. In this review we 
examine the functions of the RAL paralogs in normal cellular physiology and 
cancer biology with special consideration provided to situations where the roles 
of RALA and RALB are non-redundant.
