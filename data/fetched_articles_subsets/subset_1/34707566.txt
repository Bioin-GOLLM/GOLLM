OBJECTIVE: The current study was conducted to determine whether peak bone 
mineral density (BMD) and obesity phenotypes are associated with certain LGR4 
gene polymorphisms found in Chinese nuclear families with female children.
METHODS: A total of 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in and 
around the LGR4 gene were identified in 1,300 subjects who were members of 390 
Chinese nuclear families with female children. Then, BMD readings of the femoral 
neck, total hip, and lumbar spine as well as measurements of the total lean mass 
(TLM), total fat mass (TFM), and trunk fat mass were obtained via dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry. The quantitative transmission disequilibrium test was used 
to analyze the associations between specific SNPs and LGR4 haplotypes and peak 
BMD as well as between LGR4 haplotypes and TLM, percent lean mass, TFM, percent 
fat mass, trunk fat mass, and body mass index (BMI).
RESULTS: Here, rs7936621 was significantly associated with the BMD values for 
the total hip and lumbar spine, while rs10835171 and rs6484295 were associated 
with the trunk fat mass and BMI, respectively. Regarding the haplotypes, we 
found significant associations between GAA in block 2 and trunk fat mass and 
BMI, between AGCGT in block 3 and total hip BMD, between TGCTCC in block 5 and 
femoral neck BMD, and between TACTTC in block 5 and both lumbar spine and 
femoral neck BMD (all P-values < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Genetic variations of the LGR4 gene are related to peak BMD, BMI, 
and trunk fat mass.
