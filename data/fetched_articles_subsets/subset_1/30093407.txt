Molecular chaperones often possess functional modules that are specialized in 
assisting the formation of specific structural elements, such as a disulfide 
bridges and peptidyl-prolyl bonds in cis form, in the client protein. A 
ribosome-associated molecular chaperone trigger factor (TF), which has a 
peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domain, acts as a highly efficient 
catalyst in the folding process limited by peptidyl-prolyl isomerization. Herein 
we report a study on the mechanism through which TF recognizes the proline 
residue in the unfolded client protein during the cis/trans isomerization 
process. The solution structure of TF in complex with the client protein showed 
that TF recognizes the proline-aromatic motif located in the hydrophobic stretch 
of the unfolded client protein through its conserved hydrophobic cleft, which 
suggests that TF preferentially accelerates the isomerization of the 
peptidyl-prolyl bond that is eventually folded into the core of the protein in 
its native fold. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that TF exploits the 
backbone amide group of Ile195 to form an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the 
carbonyl oxygen of the amino acid residue preceding the proline residue at the 
transition state, which presumably stabilizes the transition state and thus 
accelerates the isomerization. The importance of such intermolecular 
hydrogen-bond formation during the catalysis was further corroborated by the 
activity assay and NMR relaxation analysis.
