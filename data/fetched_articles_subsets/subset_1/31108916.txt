Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) isoforms are cytokines involved in a 
variety of cellular processes, including myofiber repair and regulation of 
connective tissue formation. Activation of the TGF-β pathway contributes to 
pathologic fibrosis in most organs. Here, we have focused on examining the 
evidence demonstrating the involvement of TGF-β in the fibrosis of skeletal 
muscle particularly. The TGF-β pathway plays a role in different skeletal muscle 
myopathies, and TGF-β signaling is highly induced in these diseases. In this 
review, we discuss different molecular mechanisms of TGF-β-mediated skeletal 
muscle fibrosis and highlight different TGF-β-targeted treatments that target 
these relevant pathways.
