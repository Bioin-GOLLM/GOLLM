Non-urothelial carcinoma accounts for <5% of urinary bladder tumors, and primary 
bladder adenocarcinoma accounts for 0.5-2%, but the variant primary signet-ring 
cell is extremely rare. We present a rare case of a synchronous of dual primary 
malignancy from a rare variant of urinary bladder adenocarcinoma (signet-ring 
cell) with indolent prostate adenocarcinoma in a 61-year-old male. The patient 
presented with a rapidly progressive renal failure due to a non-dilated 
obstructive uropathy that formed a dilemma in the course of diagnosiswhich  was 
relieved transiently by a high-dose methylprednisolone. Primary signet-ring cell 
adenocarcinoma of the urinary bladder is a very rare malignancy manifests as a 
high-grade, high-stage lesion, which takes a vague course and has a poor 
prognosis. It is often managed with radical cystectomy due to its aggressive 
nature.
