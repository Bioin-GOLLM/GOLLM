The full length enteropeptidase or it's light chain have often used for the 
limited proteolysis of recombinant chimeric proteins incorporating the 
linker-(Asp)4Lys- to obtain the target protein. Any chimeric proteins were not 
cleaved by the full length enteropeptidase efficiently. The resistant to the 
hydrolysis chimeric protein IFN-(Asp)4Lys-HIV earlier was shown to be the 
competitive inhibitor (Ki = 3,4 x 10(-6) M) in relation to the low molecular 
substrate. In present study we were determined this chimeric protein competitive 
inhibited the same substrate hydrolysis by enteropeptidase light chain (Ki = 2,7 
x 10(-5) M). Comparison the Ki values for the substrate hydrolysis by full 
length enzyme and its light chain suggests that the enteropeptidase heavy chain 
may participate in chimeric protein binding.
