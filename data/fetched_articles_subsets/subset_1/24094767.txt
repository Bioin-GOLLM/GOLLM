BACKGROUND: Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to LDL 
receptors, leading to their degradation. Genetics studies have shown that 
loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 result in reduced plasma LDL cholesterol and 
decreased risk of coronary heart disease. We aimed to investigate the safety and 
efficacy of ALN-PCS, a small interfering RNA that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis, in 
healthy volunteers with raised cholesterol who were not on lipid-lowering 
treatment.
METHODS: We did a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 
dose-escalation study in healthy adult volunteers with serum LDL cholesterol of 
3·00 mmol/L or higher. Participants were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio by 
computer algorithm to receive one dose of intravenous ALN-PCS (with doses 
ranging from 0·015 to 0·400 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was safety 
and tolerability of ALN-PCS. Secondary endpoints were the pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of ALN-PCS and its pharmacodynamic effects on PCSK9 and LDL 
cholesterol. Study participants were masked to treatment assignment. Analysis 
was per protocol and we used ANCOVA to analyse pharmacodynamic endpoint data. 
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01437059.
FINDINGS: Of 32 participants, 24 were randomly allocated to receive a single 
dose of ALN-PCS (0·015 mg/kg [n=3], 0·045 mg/kg [n=3], 0·090 mg/kg [n=3], 0·150 
mg/kg [n=3], 0·250 mg/kg [n=6], or 0·400 mg/kg [n=6]) and eight to placebo. The 
proportions of patients affected by treatment-emergent adverse events were 
similar in the ALN-PCS and placebo groups (19 [79%] vs seven [88%]). ALN-PCS was 
rapidly distributed, with peak concentration and area under the curve (0 to last 
measurement) increasing in a roughly dose-proportional way across the dose range 
tested. In the group given 0·400 mg/kg of ALN-PCS, treatment resulted in a mean 
70% reduction in circulating PCSK9 plasma protein (p<0·0001) and a mean 40% 
reduction in LDL cholesterol from baseline relative to placebo (p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that inhibition of PCSK9 synthesis by RNA 
interference (RNAi) provides a potentially safe mechanism to reduce LDL 
cholesterol concentration in healthy individuals with raised cholesterol. These 
results support the further assessment of ALN-PCS in patients with 
hypercholesterolaemia, including those being treated with statins. This study is 
the first to show an RNAi drug being used to affect a clinically validated 
endpoint (ie, LDL cholesterol) in human beings.
