Despite the enormous public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), no 
disease-modifying treatment has yet been proven to be efficacious in humans. A 
rate-limiting step in the discovery of potential therapies for humans is the 
absence of efficient non-invasive methods of evaluating drugs in animal models 
of disease. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a non-invasive way to 
evaluate the animals at baseline, at the end of treatment, and serially to 
better understand treatment effects. In this study, MRS was assessed as 
potential outcome measure for detecting disease modification in a transgenic 
mouse model of AD. Passive immunization with two different antibodies, which 
have been previously shown to reduce plaque accumulation in transgenic AD mice, 
was used as intervention. Treatment effects were detected by MRS, and the most 
striking finding was attenuation of myo-inositol (mIns) increases in APP-PS1 
mice with both treatments. Additionally, a dose-dependent effect was observed 
with one of the treatments for mIns. MRS appears to be a valid in vivo measure 
of anti-Aβ therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. Because it is 
noninvasive, and can detect treatment effects, use of MRS-based endpoints could 
substantially accelerate drug discovery.
