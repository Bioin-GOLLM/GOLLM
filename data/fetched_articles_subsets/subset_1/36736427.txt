Fasciolosis is a worldwide parasitic disease of ruminants and an emerging human 
disease caused by the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. The cystatin superfamily of 
cysteine protease inhibitors is composed of distinct families of intracellular 
stefins and secreted true cystatins. FhCyLS-2 from F. hepatica is an unusual 
member of the superfamily, where our sequence and 3D structure analyses in this 
study revealed that it combines characteristics of both families. The protein 
architecture demonstrates its relationship to stefins, but FhCyLS-2 also 
contains the secretion signal peptide and disulfide bridges typical of true 
cystatins. The secretion status was confirmed by detecting the presence of 
FhCyLS-2 in excretory/secretory products, supported by immunolocalization. Our 
high-resolution crystal structure of FhCyLS-2 showed a distinct disulfide 
bridging pattern and functional reactive center. We determined that FhCyLS-2 is 
a broad specificity inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins from both the host and 
F. hepatica, suggesting a dual role in the regulation of exogenous and 
endogenous proteolysis. Based on phylogenetic analysis that identified several 
FhCyLS-2 homologues in liver/intestinal foodborne flukes, we propose a new group 
within the cystatin superfamily called cystatin-like stefins.
