Pellino1 has been shown to regulate proinflammatory genes by activating the 
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, 
which are important in the pathological development of lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced myocarditis. However, it is still unknown whether silencing 
Pellino1 (si-Pellino1) has a therapeutic effect on this disease. Here, we showed 
that silencing Pellino1 can be a potential protective strategy for abnormal 
myocardial energy metabolism in LPS-induced myocarditis. We used liquid 
chromatography electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to 
analyze samples from si-Pellino1 neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs) treated 
with LPS or left untreated. After normalization of the data, metabolite 
interaction analysis of matched KEGG pathway associations following si-Pellino1 
treatment was applied, accompanied by interaction analysis of gene and 
metabolite associations after this treatment. Moreover, we used western blot 
(WB) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses to determine the expression of 
genes involved in regulating cardiac energy and energy metabolism in different 
groups. LC-MS-based metabolic profiling analysis demonstrated that si-Pellino1 
treatment could alleviate or even reverse LPS-induced cellular damage by 
altering cardiomyocytes energy metabolism accompanied by changes in key genes 
(Cs, Cpt2, and Acadm) and metabolites (3-oxoocotanoyl-CoA, hydroxypyruvic acid, 
lauroyl-CoA, and NADPH) in NRCMs. Overall, our study unveiled the promising 
cardioprotective effect of silencing Pellino1 in LPS-induced myocarditis through 
fuel and energy metabolic regulation, which can also serve as biomarkers for 
this disease.
