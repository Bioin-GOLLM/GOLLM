Programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur during antigen receptor gene 
recombination, namely V(D)J recombination in developing B lymphocytes and class 
switch recombination (CSR) in mature B cells. Repair of these DSBs by classical 
end-joining (c-NHEJ) enables the generation of diverse BCR repertoires for 
efficient humoral immunity. Deletion of or mutation in c-NHEJ genes in mice and 
humans confer various degrees of primary immune deficiency and predisposition to 
lymphoid malignancies that often harbor oncogenic chromosomal translocations. In 
the absence of c-NHEJ, alternative end-joining (A-EJ) catalyzes robust CSR and 
to a much lesser extent, V(D)J recombination, but the mechanisms of A-EJ are 
only poorly defined. In this review, we introduce recent advances in the 
understanding of A-EJ in the context of V(D)J recombination and CSR with 
emphases on DSB end processing, DNA polymerases and ligases, and discuss the 
implications of A-EJ to lymphoid development and chromosomal translocations.
