The formation of cerebral senile plaques composed of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is a 
fundamental feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glial cells and more 
specifically microglia become reactive in the presence of Aβ. In a triple 
transgenic model of AD (3 × Tg-AD), we found a significant increase in activated 
microglia at 12 (by 111%) and 18 (by 88%) months of age when compared with 
non-transgenic (non-Tg) controls. This microglial activation correlated with Aβ 
plaque formation, and the activation in microglia was closely associated with Aβ 
plaques and smaller Aβ deposits. We also found a significant increase in the 
area density of resting microglia in 3 × Tg-AD animals both at plaque-free stage 
(at 9 months by 105%) and after the development of A plaques (at 12 months by 
54% and at 18 months by 131%). Our results show for the first time that the 
increase in the density of resting microglia precedes both plaque formation and 
activation of microglia by extracellular Aβ accumulation. We suggest that AD 
pathology triggers a complex microglial reaction: at the initial stages of the 
disease the number of resting microglia increases, as if in preparation for the 
ensuing activation in an attempt to fight the extracellular Aβ load that is 
characteristic of the terminal stages of the disease.
