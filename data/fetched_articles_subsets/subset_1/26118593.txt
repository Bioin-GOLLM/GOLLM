Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic cardiac disease. Gene mutation affects the 
structure or function of ion channels that are associated with a high risk of 
sudden death. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of KCNQ1, 
KCNH2, and SCN5A mutations in LQTS in a Taiwanese population. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from peripheral blood samples obtained from 5 patients with LQTS and 
the family members of 3 LQTS patients. High resolution melting (HRM) analysis 
and direct DNA sequencing were used to characterize the KCNQ1, KCNH2, and SCN5A 
genetic variations. HRM analysis was successfully optimized for 14 of the 16 
exons of the KCNQ1, 5 of the 15 exons of the KCNH2, and 23 of the 27 exons of 
the SCN5A. HRM and direct DNA sequencing was applied to the cohort of 5 cases 
and some of their family. The genetic testing revealed two pathogenic mutations 
(p.T309I in KCNQ1 and p.R744fs in KCNH2) and all of the mutational frequencies 
in KCNQ1 and KCNH2 were 20%. In the two patients who carry the pathogenic 
mutation presenting with recurrent syncope due to ventricular fibrillation, an 
implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. We also discovered 11 
polymorphisms in KCNQ1, 3 in KCNH2, and 5 in SCN5A. Two-fifths of cases (40%) 
presented with one of the three major LQTS-causing gene mutations.
