OBJECTIVE: Since there is a paucity of reference data in the literature to 
indicate the relationship between HbA1c, and 24 h mean blood glucose (MBG) from 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in Chinese populations, we described the 
above relationship in adult Chinese subjects with different glucose tolerance 
status.
METHODS: Seven-hundred-and-forty-two individuals without history of diabetes 
were included to the study at 11 hospitals in urban areas across China from 
2007-2009 and data of 673 subjects were included into the final analysis. Oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) classified the participants as nondiabetic 
subjects, including those with normal glucose regulation (NGR; n = 121) and 
impaired glucose regulation (IGR; n = 209), or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes 
(n = 343). All participants completed testing for HbA1c levels and wore a CGM 
system for three consecutive days. The 24 h MBG levels were calculated. Spearman 
correlations and linear regression analyses were applied to quantify the 
relationship between glucose markers.
RESULTS: The levels of HbA1c and 24 h MBG significantly increased with presence 
of glucose intolerance (NGR<IGR<type 2 diabetes; both, P<0.001). Analysis of the 
total population indicated that HbA1c was strongly correlated with 24 h MBG 
(r = 0.735). The correlation was also found to be significant for the subgroup 
of participants with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (r = 0.694, P<0.001). 
Linear regression analysis of the total study population yielded the following 
equation: 24 h MBG(mmol/L )= 1.198×HbA1c-0.582 (24 h 
MBG(mg/dL )= 21.564×HbA1c-10.476) (R(2)= 0.670, P<0.001). The model fit was not 
improved by application of exponential or quadratic modeling. When HbA1c was 
6.5%, the calculated 24 h MBG was 7.2 (6.4-8.1) mmol/L (130 (115-146) mg/dL); 
and when HbA1c was 7.0%, the 24 h MBG was 7.8 (6.9-8.7) mmol/L (140 (124-157) 
mg/dL).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provided the reference data of the relationship between 
HbA1c and CGM in Chinese subjects.
