Low level light therapy receives increasing interest in the fields of tissue 
regeneration and wound healing. Several in vivo studies demonstrated the 
positive effects of LLLT on angiogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the 
underlying properties in vitro by comparing the effects of light therapy by 
light emitting diodes of different wavelengths on endothelial cells in vitro. 
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with either 475 nm, 516 nm 
or 635 nm light. Control cells were not illuminated. 2D proliferation was 
quantified by manual counting. HUVEC migration was analyzed by performing a 2D 
wound scratch assay and a 3D bead assay. The influence of LLLT on early 
vasculogenic events was determined in a 3D fibrin co-culture model with 
adipose-derived stem cells. Stimulation with both red and green pulsed LED light 
significantly increased HUVEC proliferation and 3D migration. Moreover, HUVEC 
showed increased 2D migration potential with green light stimulation. The 
treatment with blue light was ineffective. Several parameters showed that green 
light was even more potent to stimulate proliferation and migration of 
endothelial cells than clinically well-established red light therapy. Further 
studies have to focus on intracellular mechanisms induced by different 
wavelengths in order to optimize this promising therapy in tissue regeneration.
