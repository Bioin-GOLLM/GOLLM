Human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ras proteins and their regulators GAP (GTPase 
activating protein)and GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) display 
structural similarities and are functionally interchangeable in vivo and in 
vitro, indicating that the molecular mechanism regulating Ras proteins has been 
conserved during evolution. As the only exceptions, the two S.cerevisiae GAPs, 
Ira1p and Ira2p, are strictly specific for yeast Ras proteins and cannot 
stimulate the GTPase of mammalian Ras. This study searches for the reasons for 
the different sensitivity to Ira2p of human H-ras p21 and yeast Ras2p. 
Construction of H-ras/Ras2p chimaeras showed that Gly18 of Ras2p (Ala11 of H-ras 
p21) is an important determinant for the specificity of Ira2p, revealing for the 
first time a function for this position. A second even more crucial determinant 
was found to be the 89-102 region of Ras2p (82-95 of H-ras p21) including the 
distal part of strand beta4, loop L6 and the proximal part of helix alpha3. It 
was possible to construct Ras2p's resistant to Ira2p but still sensitive to 
human p120-GAP and, conversely, a H-ras p21 sensitive to Ira2p. This work helps 
clarify specific aspects of the conserved molecular mechanism of interaction 
between Ras proteins and their negative GAP regulators.
