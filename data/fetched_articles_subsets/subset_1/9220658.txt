The distribution of variant hemoglobin in India has been related to various 
ethnic groups among other factors. beta-Thalassemia is the most frequent 
monogenic disorder in the country. Analysis of hemoglobin of 435 cases from 
Eastern India was performed by electrophoresis and by other quantitative 
methods. Analysis of the beta-globin gene of 112 cases used ARMS (amplification 
refractory mutation system)-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) techniques showing 
that IVS-1 nt 5 (G-->C) is the most prevalent mutation in populations from 
Eastern India. IVS-1 nt 5 (G-->C) interacts with the codon 26 (G-->A) mutation 
to produce E beta-thalassemia phenotype in the samples from West Bengal, India.
