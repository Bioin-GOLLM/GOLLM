BACKGROUND: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is a common 
arrhythmia. Growing evidence suggests that family aggregation and genetic 
factors are involved in AVNRT. However, in families with a history of AVNRT, 
disease-causing genes have not been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic contribution of familial AVNRT using a 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) approach.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 20 patients from nine families with a 
history of AVNRT and 100 control participants, and we systematically analyzed 
mutation profiles using WES. Gene-based burden analysis, integration of previous 
sporadic AVNRT data, pedigree-based co-segregation, protein-protein interaction 
network analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, and confirmation of animal 
phenotype were performed.
RESULTS: Among 95 related reference genes, seven candidate pathogenic genes have 
been identified both in sporadic and familial AVNRT, including CASQ2, AGXT, 
ANK2, SYNE2, ZFHX3, GJD3, and SCN4A. Among the 37 reference genes from sporadic 
AVNRT, five candidate pathogenic genes were identified in patients with both 
familial and sporadic AVNRT: LAMC1, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), COL4A3, NOS1, 
and ATP2C2. To identify the common pathogenic mechanisms in all AVNRT cases, 
five pathogenic genes were identified in patients with both familial and 
sporadic AVNRT: LAMC1, RYR2, COL4A3, NOS1, and ATP2C2. Considering the unique 
internal candidate pathogenic gene within pedigrees, three genes, TRDN, CASQ2, 
and WNK1, were likely to be the pathogenic genes in familial AVNRT. Notably, the 
core calcium-signaling pathway may be closely associated with the occurrence of 
AVNRT, including CASQ2, RYR2, TRDN, NOS1, ANK2, and ATP2C2.
CONCLUSION: Our pedigree-based studies demonstrate that RYR2 and related calcium 
signaling pathway play a critical role in the pathogenesis of familial AVNRT 
using the WES approach.
