Intrinsic resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in breast cancer remains an obstacle 
in the clinic, limiting its efficacy. However, the biological basis for 
intrinsic resistance is poorly understood. Here we performed a 
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function genetic profiling and identified TALDO1, 
which encodes the rate-limiting transaldolase (TA) enzyme in the non-oxidative 
pentose phosphate pathway, as essential for cellular survival following 
pharmacological HER2 blockade. Suppression of TA increases cell susceptibility 
to HER2 inhibition in two intrinsically resistant breast cancer cell lines with 
HER2 amplification. Mechanistically, TA depletion combined with HER2 inhibition 
significantly reduces cellular NADPH levels, resulting in excessive ROS 
production and deficient lipid and nucleotide synthesis. Importantly, higher TA 
expression correlates with poor response to HER2 inhibition in a breast cancer 
patient cohort. Together, these results pinpoint TA as a novel metabolic enzyme 
possessing synthetic lethality with HER2 inhibition that can potentially be 
exploited as a biomarker or target for combination therapy.
