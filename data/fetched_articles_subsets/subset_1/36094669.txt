BACKGROUND: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a measure of arterial stiffness. We 
investigated PWV and blood pressure (BP) to determine to what extent BP changes 
contribute to arterial stiffness, and secondly, to identify influencing factors 
on BP in children after kidney transplantation.
METHODS: Seventy children ≥ 2.5 years post-transplantation with at least two PWV 
measurements were included. Changes of systolic (Δ SBP) and diastolic BP (Δ DBP) 
were classified into "stable/decreasing," "1-10 mmHg increase," and " > 10 mmHg 
increase." Linear mixed modeling for PWV z-score (PWVz) adjusted either for Δ 
SBP or Δ DBP was performed. An extended dataset with monthly entries of BP, 
immunosuppression, and creatinine was obtained in 35 participants over a median 
of 74 months to perform linear mixed modeling for SBP and DBP.
RESULTS: PWVz increased with a rate of 0.11/year (95% CI 0.054 to 0.16). 
Compared to participants with stable BP, those with 1-10-mmHg SBP and DBP 
increase showed a higher PWVz of 0.59 (95% CI 0.046 to 1.13) and 0.86 (95% CI 
0.43 to 1.30), respectively. A > 10-mmHg BP increase was associated with an even 
higher PWVz (SBP β = 0.78, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.34; DBP β = 1.37, 95% CI 0.80 to 
1.94). Female sex and participants with lower eGFR showed higher PWVz. In the 
extended analysis, DBP was positively associated with cyclosporin A and 
everolimus trough levels.
CONCLUSIONS: A higher increase of PWV is seen in patients with greater BP 
increase, with higher cyclosporin A and everolimus trough levels associated with 
higher BP. This emphasizes the role of BP as a modifiable risk factor for the 
improvement of cardiovascular outcome after transplantation. A higher resolution 
version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.
