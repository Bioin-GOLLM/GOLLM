New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses are rodent-borne agents that cause 
severe human disease. The GP1 subunit of the surface glycoprotein mediates cell 
attachment through transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). We report the structure of 
Machupo virus (MACV) GP1 bound with human TfR1. Atomic details of the GP1-TfR1 
interface clarify the importance of TfR1 residues implicated in New World 
arenavirus host specificity. Analysis of sequence variation among New World 
arenavirus GP1s and their host-species receptors, in light of the molecular 
structure, indicates determinants of viral zoonotic transmission. Infectivities 
of pseudoviruses in cells expressing mutated TfR1 confirm that contacts at the 
tip of the TfR1 apical domain determine the capacity of human TfR1 to mediate 
infection by particular New World arenaviruses. We propose that New World 
arenaviruses that are pathogenic to humans fortuitously acquired affinity for 
human TfR1 during adaptation to TfR1 of their natural hosts.
