BACKGROUND: The aim of the present retrospective study was to analyze clinical 
outcome and risk factors associated with treatment outcomes according to KRAS 
status in patient with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with 
bevacizumab (bev) plus chemotherapy in the first-line setting.
METHODS: We performed observational study on 1622 patients with mCRC treated 
with bev plus oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and correlated 
treatment outcomes with KRAS mutation status. The primary endpoint was 
progression-free survival (PFS) and additionally overall survival (OS). Adverse 
events of bevacizumab and risk factors including location of metastases were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Mutation in KRAS was present in 40.6% of mCRC cases. The median PFS in 
patients with wild-type KRAS (wtKRAS) vs mutant KRAS was 11.5 vs 11.4 months, 
respectively. The median OS was 30.7 vs 28.4 months (p = 0.312). Patients with 
KRAS mutation had lung metastases more frequently than wtKRAS individuals (32.0% 
vs 23.8%; p = 0.001). We observed no difference in clinical outcome between 
hepatic and extrahepatic metastatic disease.
CONCLUSION: KRAS mutation does not interfere with clinical benefit from 
first-line treatment with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in mCRC patients.
