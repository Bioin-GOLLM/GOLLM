BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis contributes to high liver-related mortality 
globally. Systemic inflammation mediated by immune cells contributes to the 
progression of liver cirrhosis. Growing evidence shows that several pro- and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines might have an important role in liver cirrhosis.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between serum IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and 
IL-23 levels and severity of liver cirrhosis.
METHODS: This observational study was carried out at the Department of Internal 
Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara, Indonesia from March 2018 to August 2019. 
The severity of liver cirrhosis was assessed by using the Child-Pugh score. 
IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23 levels, hepatitis and renal function were measured 
in all study subjects. Independent t-test and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted 
to observe differences between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 78 liver cirrhosis patients were enrolled, mean age was 
50.6±11.4. Median serum IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23 levels were 
24.5(2.6-46.4)pg/ml, 2.1(0.4-9.3)pg/ml, 3.5(1.4-20.8)pg/ml and 
20.3(9.2-218)pg/ml, respectively. A higher IL-6 level was associated with more 
severe liver cirrhosis (p=0.001) and the presence of hepatic encephalopathy 
(p=0.018). Higher IL-23 level was found in patients with no hepatic 
encephalopathy (p=0.049). There was no association between serum cytokines 
levels and hepatitis viral infection status.
CONCLUSION: IL-6 is associated with the severity of liver cirrhosis.
