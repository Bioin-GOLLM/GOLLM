Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disease that originates from 
an expansion of CTG microsatellites in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK 
gene, thus leading to the expression of transcripts containing expanded CUG 
repeats (CUGexp). The pathophysiology is explained by a toxic RNA gain of 
function where CUGexp RNAs form nuclear aggregates that sequester and alter the 
function of MBNL splicing factors, triggering splicing misregulation linked to 
the DM1 symptoms. There is currently no cure for DM1, and most therapeutic 
strategies aim at eliminating CUGexp-DMPK transcripts. Here, we investigate a 
DMPK-promoter silencing strategy using CRISPR interference as a new alternative 
approach. Different sgRNAs targeting the DMPK promoter are evaluated in DM1 
patient muscle cells. The most effective guides allowed us to reduce the level 
of DMPK transcripts and CUGexp-RNA aggregates up to 80%. The CUGexp-DMPK 
repression corrects the overall transcriptome, including spliceopathy, and 
reverses a physiological parameter in DM1 muscle cells. Its action is specific 
and restricted to the DMPK gene, as confirmed by genome-wide expression 
analysis. Altogether, our findings highlight DMPK-promoter silencing by CRISPRi 
as a promising therapeutic approach for DM1.
