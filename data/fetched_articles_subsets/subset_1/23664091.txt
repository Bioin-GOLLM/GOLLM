Recent advances in sequencing technologies have revealed extensive intratumour 
heterogeneity (ITH) both within individual tumours and between primary and 
metastatic tumours for different cancer types. Such genetic diversity may have 
clinical implications for both cancer diagnosis and treatment with increasing 
evidence linking ITH and therapeutic resistance. Nonetheless, whilst limiting 
the activity of targeted agents, tumour genetic heterogeneity may provide a new 
therapeutic opportunity through generation of neo-antigens that could be 
recognised and targeted by the patient's own immune system in response to 
immune-modulatory therapies. Longitudinal genomic studies assessing tumour 
clonal architecture and its correlation with the underlying immune response to 
cancer in each particular patient are needed to follow tumour evolutionary 
dynamics over time and through therapy, in order to further understand the 
mechanisms behind drug resistance and to inform the development of new 
combinatorial therapeutic strategies.
