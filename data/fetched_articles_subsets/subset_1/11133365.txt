The periaxin gene (PRX) encodes two PDZ-domain proteins, L- and S-periaxin, that 
are required for maintenance of peripheral nerve myelin. Prx(-/-) mice develop a 
severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, despite apparently normal initial 
formation of myelin sheaths. We hypothesized that mutations in PRX could cause 
human peripheral myelinopathies. In accordance with this, we identified three 
unrelated Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy patients with recessive PRX mutations-two 
with compound heterozygous nonsense and frameshift mutations, and one with a 
homozygous frameshift mutation. We mapped PRX to 19q13.13-13.2, a region 
recently associated with a severe autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy 
in a Lebanese family (Delague et al. 2000) and syntenic to the location of Prx 
on murine chromosome 7 (Gillespie et al. 1997).
