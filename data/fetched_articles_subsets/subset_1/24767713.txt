The E318K mutation in the MITF gene has been associated with a high risk of 
melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer; the risk of other cancers 
has not been evaluated so far. Herein, we examined the possible association of 
E318K and a novel variant of the MITF gene, V320I, with the risk of cancers of 
different sites of origin in a Polish population. We assayed for the presence of 
the E318K and V320I missense mutations in 4,226 patients with one of six various 
cancers (melanoma or cancer of the kidney, lung, prostate, colon, or breast) and 
2,114 controls from Poland. The E318K mutation was detected in 4 of 2,114 
participants (0.19%) in the Polish control population, the V320I in 3 of 2,114 
participants (0.14%) in the control group. We found no statistically significant 
differences in the prevalence of the E318K and V320I variants among cases and 
controls. We found two carriers of the E318K variant among melanoma patients (P 
= 0.95), one carrier among breast cancer patients (P = 0.77), one carrier among 
colorectal cancer patients (P = 0.82), and one carrier among kidney cancer 
patients (P = 0.64). Our study demonstrates a lack of strong association of 
E318K and V320I with increased risk of melanoma or cancers of the kidney, 
breast, prostate, lung, or colon.
