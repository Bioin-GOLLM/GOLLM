A complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence was reconstructed from a 38,000 
year-old Neandertal individual with 8341 mtDNA sequences identified among 4.8 Gb 
of DNA generated from approximately 0.3 g of bone. Analysis of the assembled 
sequence unequivocally establishes that the Neandertal mtDNA falls outside the 
variation of extant human mtDNAs, and allows an estimate of the divergence date 
between the two mtDNA lineages of 660,000 +/- 140,000 years. Of the 13 proteins 
encoded in the mtDNA, subunit 2 of cytochrome c oxidase of the mitochondrial 
electron transport chain has experienced the largest number of amino acid 
substitutions in human ancestors since the separation from Neandertals. There is 
evidence that purifying selection in the Neandertal mtDNA was reduced compared 
with other primate lineages, suggesting that the effective population size of 
Neandertals was small.
