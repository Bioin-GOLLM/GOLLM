BACKGROUND: (V600) BRAF mutations drive approximately 50% of metastatic melanoma 
which can be therapeutically targeted by BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) and, based on 
resistance mechanisms, the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
(BRAFi + MEKi). Although the combination therapy has been shown to provide 
superior clinical benefits, acquired resistance is still prevalent and limits 
the overall survival benefits. Recent work has shown that oncogenic changes can 
lead to alterations in tumor cell metabolism rendering cells addicted to 
nutrients, such as the amino acid glutamine. Here, we evaluated whether melanoma 
cells with acquired resistance display glutamine dependence and whether 
glutamine metabolism can be a potential molecular target to treat resistant 
cells.
METHODS: Isogenic BRAFi sensitive parental (V600) BRAF mutant melanoma cell 
lines and resistant (derived by chronic treatment with vemurafenib) sub-lines 
were used to assess differences in the glutamine uptake and sensitivity to 
glutamine deprivation. To evaluate a broader range of resistance mechanisms, 
isogenic pairs where the sub-lines were resistant to BRAFi + MEKi were also 
studied. Since resistant cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to glutamine 
deficiency, we used glutaminase inhibitors BPTES [bis-2-(5 phenylacetamido-1, 2, 
4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulfide] and L-L-DON (6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) to 
treat MAPK pathway inhibitor (MAPKi) resistant cell populations both in vitro 
and in vivo.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that MAPKi-acquired resistant cells uptook greater 
amounts of glutamine and have increased sensitivity to glutamine deprivation 
than their MAPKi-sensitive counterparts. In addition, it was found that both 
BPTES and L-DON were more effective at decreasing cell survival of 
MAPKi-resistant sub-lines than parental cell populations in vitro. We also 
showed that mutant NRAS was critical for glutamine addiction in mutant NRAS 
driven resistance. When tested in vivo, we found that xenografts derived from 
resistant cells were more sensitive to BPTES or L-DON treatment than those 
derived from parental cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study is a proof-of-concept for the potential of targeting 
glutamine metabolism as an alternative strategy to suppress acquired 
MAPKi-resistance in melanoma.
