The incidence of congenital heart defects is higher in infants with mutation of 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. The MTHFR C677T gene decreases 
the bioavailability of folate and increases plasma homocysteine, a risk factor 
for thrombosis. There have been no reported cases in the literature on the 
clinical implications of this procoagulable state in the setting of cyanotic 
heart disease, which itself has prothrombotic predisposition. Two patients with 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome developed postoperative thrombotic 
complications, both were homozygous for MTHFR C677T. We present these cases and 
highlight the implications of MTHFR mutation in the management of complex 
congenital heart disease.
