It has been suggested that ephrin-B proteins have receptor-like roles in the 
control of axon pathfinding by repulsion, although it is largely unknown how the 
reverse signals are coupled to downstream intracellular molecules and how they 
induce cytoskeletal reorganization at the axon terminal. We found that ephrin-B3 
(EB3) was able to function as a repulsive guidance receptor and mediate 
stereotyped pruning of murine hippocampal mossy fiber axons during postnatal 
development. Targeted intracellular point mutants showed that axon pruning 
requires tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent reverse signaling and coupling to 
the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Grb4 (also known as Nckbeta/Nck2). Furthermore, we 
found that the second SH3 domain of Grb4 is required and sufficient for axon 
pruning/retraction by mediating interactions with Dock180 and PAK to bring about 
guanine nucleotide exchange and signaling downstream of Rac, respectively. Our 
results reveal a previously unknown pathway that controls axon pruning and 
elucidate the biochemical mechanism by which ephrin-B reverse signals regulate 
actin dynamics to bring about the retraction of growth cones.
