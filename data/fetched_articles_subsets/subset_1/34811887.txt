p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are a family of cell division control protein 
42/ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Cdc42/Rac1)-activated 
serine/threonine kinases. Group I PAKs (PAK1-3) have distinct activation 
mechanisms from group II PAKs (PAK4-6) and are the focus of this review. In 
transformed cancer cells, PAKs regulate a variety of cellular processes and 
molecular pathways which are also important for myelin formation and repair in 
the central nervous system (CNS). De novo mutations in group I PAKs are 
frequently seen in children with neurodevelopmental defects and white matter 
anomalies. Group I PAKs regulate virtually every aspect of neuronal development 
and function. Yet their functions in CNS myelination and remyelination remain 
incompletely defined. Herein, we highlight the current understanding of PAKs in 
regulating cellular and molecular pathways and discuss the status of 
PAK-regulated pathways in oligodendrocyte development. We point out outstanding 
questions and future directions in the research field of group I PAKs and 
oligodendrocyte development.
