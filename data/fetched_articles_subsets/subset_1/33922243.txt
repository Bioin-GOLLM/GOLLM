Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common complications of diabetes 
mellitus. After development of DN, patients will progress to end-stage renal 
disease, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we 
developed early-stage diagnostic biomarkers to detect DN as a strategy for DN 
intervention. For the DN model, Zucker diabetic fatty rats were used for DN 
phenotyping. The results revealed that DN rats showed significantly increased 
blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine levels, 
accompanied by severe kidney injury, fibrosis and microstructural changes. In 
addition, DN rats showed significantly increased urinary excretion of kidney 
injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). 
Transcriptome analysis revealed that new DN biomarkers, such as complementary 
component 4b (C4b), complementary factor D (CFD), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 
6 (CXCR6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were identified. Furthermore, 
they were found in the urine of patients with DN. Since these biomarkers were 
detected in the urine and kidney of DN rats and urine of diabetic patients, the 
selected markers could be used as early diagnosis biomarkers for chronic 
diabetic nephropathy.
