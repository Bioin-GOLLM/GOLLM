INTRODUCTION: Deubiquitinating-enzymes (DUBs) are key components of the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The fundamental role of DUBs is specific 
removal of ubiquitin from substrates. DUBs contribute to 
activation/deactivation, recycling and localization of numerous regulatory 
proteins, and thus play major roles in diverse cellular processes. Altered DUB 
activity is associated with a multitudes of pathologies including cancer. 
Therefore, DUBs represent novel candidates for target-directed drug development.
AREAS COVERED: The article is a thorough review/accounting of patented compounds 
targeting DUBs and stratifying/classifying the patented compounds based on: 
chemical-structures, nucleic-acid compositions, modes-of-action, and targeting 
sites. The review provides a brief background on the UPS and the involvement of 
DUBs. Furthermore, methods for assessing efficacy and potential pharmacological 
utility of DUB inhibitor (DUBi) are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: The FDA's approval of the 20S proteasome inhibitors (PIs): 
bortezomib and carfilzomib for treatment of hematological malignancies 
established the UPS as an anti-cancer target. Unfortunately, many patients are 
inherently resistant or develop resistance to PIs. One potential strategy to 
combat PI resistance is targeting upstream components of the UPS such as DUBs. 
DUBs represent a promising potential therapeutic target due to their critical 
roles in various cellular processes including protein turnover, localization and 
cellular homeostasis. While considerable efforts have been undertaken to develop 
DUB modulators, significant advancements are necessary to move DUBis into the 
clinic.
