When susceptibility to diseases is caused by cis-effects of multiple alleles at 
adjacent polymorphic sites, it may be difficult to assess with confidence the 
genetic phase and identify individuals carrying the risk haplotype. Experimental 
assessment of genetic phase is still challenging and most population studies use 
statistical approaches to infer haplotypes given the observed genotypes. While 
these statistical approaches are powerful and have been proven very useful in 
large scale genetic population studies, they may be prone to errors in studies 
with small sample size, especially in the presence of compound heterozygotes. 
Here, we describe a simple and novel approach using the popular PCR-RFLP based 
strategy to assess the genetic phase in compound heterozygotes. We apply this 
method to two extensively studied SNPs in two clustered immune-related genes: 
The -308 (G > A) and the +252 (A > G) SNPs of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 
alpha and the lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) genes, respectively. Using this method, we 
successfully determined the genetic phase of these two SNPs in known compound 
heterozygous individuals and in every sample tested. We show that the A allele 
of TNF -308 is carried on the same chromosome as the LTA +252(G) allele.
