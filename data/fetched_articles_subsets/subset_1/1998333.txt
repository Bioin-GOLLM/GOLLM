Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an X-linked humeroperoneal dystrophy 
associated with cardiomyopathy that is distinct from the Duchenne and Becker 
forms of X-linked muscular dystrophy. Linkage analysis has assigned EDMD to the 
terminal region of the human X chromosome long arm. We report here further 
linkage analysis in two multigenerational EDMD families using seven Xq28 marker 
loci. Cumulative lod scores suggest that EDMD is approximately 2 cM from DXS52 
(lod = 15.67) and very close to the factor VIII (F8C) and the red/green color 
pigment (R/GCP) loci, with respective lod scores of 9.62 and 10.77, without a 
single recombinant. Several recombinations between EDMD and three proximal Xq28 
markers suggest that the EDMD gene is located in distal Xq28. Multipoint linkage 
analysis indicates that the odds are 2,000:1 that EDMD lies distal to DXS305. 
These data substantially refine the ability to perform accurate carrier 
detection, prenatal diagnosis, and the presymptomatic diagnosis of at-risk males 
for EDMD by linkage analysis. The positioning of the EDMD locus close to the 
loci for F8C and R/GCP will assist in future efforts to identify and isolate the 
disease gene.
