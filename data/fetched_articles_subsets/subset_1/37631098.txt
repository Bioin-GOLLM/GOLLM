BACKGROUND: The inflammatory process represents a specific response of the 
organism's immune system. More often, it is related to the rising pain in the 
affected area. Independently of its origin, pain represents a complex and 
multidimensional acute or chronic subjective unpleasant perception. Currently, 
medical doctors prescribe various analgesics for pain treatment, but 
unfortunately, many of them have adverse effects or are not strong enough to 
suppress the pain. Thus, the search for new pain-relieving medical drugs 
continues.
METHODS: New tetrapeptide analogs of FELL with a generaanalgesic-Glu-X3-X4-Z, 
where X = Nle, Ile, or Val and Z = NH2 or COOH, containing different hydrophobic 
amino acids at positions 3 and 4, were synthesized by means of standard 
solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc/OtBu strategy in order to study the 
influence of structure and hydrophobicity on the analgesic activity. The purity 
of all compounds was monitored by HPLC, and their structures were proven by 
ESI-MS. Logp values (partition coefficient in octanol/water) for FELL analogs 
were calculated. Analgesic activity was examined by the Paw-pressure test 
(Randall-Selitto test).
RESULTS: The obtained results reveal that Leu is the best choice as a 
hydrophobic amino acid in the FELL structure.
CONCLUSIONS: The best analgesic activity is found in the parent compound FELL 
and its C-terminal amide analog.
