The aim of this study was to investigate whether the VKORC1*3 (rs7294/9041 
G > A), VKORC1*4 (rs17708472/6009 C > T), and CYP4F2 (rs2108622/1347 C > T) 
polymorphisms were associated with elevated warfarin maintenance dose 
requirements in patients with myocardial infarction (n = 105) from the Warfarin 
Aspirin Reinfarction Study (WARIS-II). We found significant associations between 
elevated warfarin dose requirements and VKORC1*3 and VKORC1*4 polymorphisms (P = 
.001 and P = .004, resp.), whereas CYP4F2 (1347 C > T) showed a weak association 
on higher warfarin dose requirements (P = .09). However, analysing these variant 
alleles in a regression analysis together with our previously reported data on 
VKORC1*2, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms, gave no significant associations 
for neither VKORC1*3, VKORC1*4 nor CYP4F2 (1347 C > T). In conclusion, in 
patients with myocardial infarction, the individual contribution to warfarin 
dose requirements from VKORC1*3, VKORC1*4, and CYP4F2 (1347 C > T) polymorphisms 
was negligible. Our results indicate that pharmacogenetic testing for VKORC1*2, 
CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 is more informative regarding warfarin dose requirements 
than testing for VKORC1*3, VKORC1*4, and CYP4F2 (1347 C > T) polymorphisms.
