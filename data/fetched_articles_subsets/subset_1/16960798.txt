We mapped the genetic influences for type 1 diabetes (T1D), using 2,360 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the 4.4-Mb human major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus and the adjacent 493 kb centromeric to 
the MHC, initially in a survey of 363 Swedish T1D cases and controls. We 
confirmed prior studies showing association with T1D in the MHC, most 
significantly near HLA-DR/DQ. In the region centromeric to the MHC, we 
identified a peak of association within the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 
3 gene (ITPR3; formerly IP3R3). The most significant single SNP in this region 
was at the center of the ITPR3 peak of association (P=1.7 x 10(-4) for the 
survey study). For validation, we typed an additional 761 Swedish individuals. 
The P value for association computed from all 1,124 individuals was 1.30 x 
10(-6) (recessive odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.9). The 
estimated population-attributable risk of 21.6% (95% CI 10.0%-31.0%) suggests 
that variation within ITPR3 reflects an important contribution to T1D in Sweden. 
Two-locus regression analysis supports an influence of ITPR3 variation on T1D 
that is distinct from that of any MHC class II gene.
