Practical and reliable methods for the objective measure of taste function are 
critically important for studying eating behavior and taste function impairment. 
Here, we present direct measures of human gustatory response to a prototypical 
bitter compound, 6-n-propyltiouracil (PROP), obtained by electrophysiological 
recordings from the tongue of subjects who were classified for taster status and 
genotyped for the specific receptor gene (TAS2R38), and in which taste papilla 
density was determined. PROP stimulation evoked negative slow potentials that 
represent the summated depolarization of taste cells. Depolarization amplitude 
and rate were correlated with papilla density and perceived bitterness, and 
associated with taster status and TAS2R38. Our study provides a robust and 
generalizable research tool for the quantitative measure of peripheral taste 
function, which can greatly help to resolve controversial outcomes on the PROP 
phenotype role in taste perception and food preferences, and be potentially 
useful for evaluating nutritional status and health.
