The chemoattractant Receptor23 (ChemR23) plays an essential role in triggering 
and resolving acute inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate the association 
between four potentially functional SNPs of the chemR23 gene (rs4373981 G > C, 
rs73201532 C > T, rs35121177 G > A, and rs4964676 G > A) with susceptibility to 
Allergic rhinitis (AR). 130 patients with allergic rhinitis and 130 healthy 
individuals were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Our findings showed that genotypes and 
alleles frequencies were not significantly different between patient and control 
groups (p > 0.05). Furthermore, haplotype analysis (rs4373981, rs73201532, and 
rs4964676, respectively) revealed a protective effect of CTG, GTA, and GTG 
haplotypes against AR (p = 0.009, p = 0.0001, p = 0.001, respectively), and CCG, 
GCA, and GCG haplotypes of ChemR23 polymorphisms were associated with increased 
risk of AR (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, p = 0.0002, respectively). These findings 
suggested a possible role for ChemR23 in the pathogenesis of AR.
