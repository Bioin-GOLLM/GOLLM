BACKGROUND: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a lysosomal disorder 
caused by deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) leading to the accumulation 
of sphingomyelin (SM) in a variety of cell types. Lysosphingomyelin (LysoSM) is 
the de-acetylated form of SM and it has been shown as a biomarker for ASMD in 
tissues, plasma, and dried blood spots (DBS) and lysosphingomyelin-509 
(LysoSM509) is the carboxylated analogue of LysoSM. High levels of 
Lysosphingomyelin 509 (LysoSM509) have also been shown in ASMD patients. In this 
study, we report the utility of the quantification of LysoSM and LysoSM509 in 
DBS of patients from Latin America with ASMD by ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: DBS samples from 14 ASMD patients were compared with 15 controls, and 
44 general newborns. All patients had their diagnosis confirmed by the 
quantification of ASM and the measurement of the activity of chitotriosidase. 
All patients had significantly higher levels of lysoSM and lysoSM509 compared to 
controls and general newborns.
CONCLUSIONS: The quantification of lysosphingolipids in DBS is a valuable tool 
for the diagnosis of ASMD patients and lysoSM can be useful in the differential 
diagnosis with NPC. This method is also valuable in the ASMD newborn screening 
process.
