The peptide comprising residues 62-73 of the B-chain of human alpha-thrombin was 
synthesized and polyclonal antibodies raised against it. These antibodies were 
found to bind to the synthetic peptide, a CNBr fragment, and a proteolytic 
subfragment containing this sequence, as well as the entire thrombin molecule. 
The purified antibodies had no effect on the hydrolysis by thrombin of 
D-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-p-nitroanilide and caused only a minimal decrease (20%) in 
the second-order rate constant for inactivation by antithrombin III. On the 
other hand, the antibodies competitively inhibited the binding of hirudin over 
the concentration range tested (0-43 nM), and a dissociation constant of 3.4 +/- 
0.5 nM was found for the antibodies. The release of fibrinopeptide A from the A 
alpha-chain of fibrinogen by thrombin was competitively inhibited with an 
inhibition constant of 11.7 +/- 0.4 nM. The activation of protein C by thrombin 
in the presence of thrombomodulin was also inhibited by the antibodies, and an 
apparent inhibition constant of 10.7 +/- 1.5 nM was found. In contrast, the 
antibodies had no effect on the activation of protein C in the absence of 
thrombomodulin. These results are discussed in relation to data obtained 
recently on the interaction of well defined proteolytic derivatives of human 
alpha-thrombin with the ligands described above.
