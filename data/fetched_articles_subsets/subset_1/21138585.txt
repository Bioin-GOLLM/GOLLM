BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy 
bodies (DLB) is associated with the accumulation of aggregated forms of the 
α-synuclein (αSN) protein. An early event in the neuropathology of PD and DLB is 
the loss of synapses and a corresponding reduction in the level of synaptic 
proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in synapse damage in these 
diseases are poorly understood. In this study the process of synapse damage was 
investigated by measuring the amount of synaptophysin, a pre-synaptic membrane 
protein essential for neurotransmission, in cultured neurons incubated with αSN, 
or with amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that are thought to trigger synapse degeneration 
in Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: We report that the addition of recombinant human αSN reduced the amount 
of synaptophysin in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons indicative of 
synapse damage. αSN also reduced synaptic vesicle recycling, as measured by the 
uptake of the fluorescent dye FM1-43. These effects of αSN on synapses were 
modified by interactions with other proteins. Thus, the addition of βSN reduced 
the effects of αSN on synapses. In contrast, the addition of amyloid-β (Aβ)1-42 
exacerbated the effects of αSN on synaptic vesicle recycling and synapse damage. 
Similarly, the addition of αSN increased synapse damage induced by Aβ1-42. 
However, this effect of αSN was selective as it did not affect synapse damage 
induced by the prion-derived peptide PrP82-146.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that oligomers of 
αSN trigger synapse damage in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients. 
Moreover, they suggest that the effect of αSN on synapses may be influenced by 
interactions with other peptides produced within the brain.
