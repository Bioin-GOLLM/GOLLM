When placed in a novel environment, mice tend to explore for a period of time, 
and then reduce the level of exploration. This reduction in locomotor or 
exploratory behavior is known as habituation and can occur within a single 
session or across sessions, respectively, termed intrasession and intersession 
habituation. Recent research indicates that there is a genetic component to 
habituation behavior and that some of the genes involved differ between the two 
types of habituation. The genetic evidence also suggests that intrasession 
habituation and intersession habituation are measuring somewhat different 
conceptual entities and with more such evidence may eventually help us 
understand the different pathways involved. Some of the genetic methods and 
tools used to unravel the roles of specific genes in both types of habituation 
are outlined here, with examples from the literature, as well as new data, to 
illustrate that this seemingly simple behavior is actually very complicated in 
terms of genetics. Evidence to date suggests that a number of genetic regions 
play roles in one or both types of habituation, and further research will be 
necessary to determine the specific genes involved.
