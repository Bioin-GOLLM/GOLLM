Structural studies on a hereditary abnormal prothrombin, prothrombin Salakta, 
have been performed to identify the difference responsible for its reduced 
fibrinogen clotting activity and its reduced esterase activity. Amino acid 
composition and sequence analyses of a peptide isolated from a 
lysylendopeptidase digest of the abnormal thrombin indicated that Glu-466 had 
been replaced by Ala. This amino acid substitution can result from a single 
nucleotide change in the codon for Glu-466 (GAG----GCG). The model building and 
the molecular dynamics simulation of thrombin Salakta suggest that the 
Glu-466----Ala substitution would change the proper conformation around the 
substrate binding site containing Trp-468, which is a unique surface loop on the 
thrombin molecule. This is the experimental and theoretical evidence supporting 
the role of the surface loop containing Trp-468 for the proper conformation of 
the substrate binding site.
