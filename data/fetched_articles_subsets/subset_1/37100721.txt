Recent work demonstrating that asymptomatic carriers of P. falciparum parasites 
make up a large part of the infectious reservoir highlights the need for an 
effective malaria vaccine. Given the historical challenges of vaccine 
development, multiple parasite stages have been targeted, including the sexual 
stages required for transmission. Using flow cytometry to efficiently screen for 
P. falciparum gamete/zygote surface reactivity, we identified 82 antibodies that 
bound live P. falciparum gametes/zygotes. Ten antibodies had significant 
transmission-reducing activity (TRA) in a standard membrane feeding assay and 
were subcloned along with 9 nonTRA antibodies as comparators. After subcloning, 
only eight of the monoclonals obtained have significant TRA. These eight TRA 
mAbs do not recognize epitopes present in any of the current recombinant 
transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, Pfs230D1M, Pfs48/45.6C, Pf47 D2 and 
rPfs25. One TRA mAb immunoprecipitates two surface antigens, Pfs47 and Pfs230, 
that are expressed by both gametocytes and gametes/zygotes. These two proteins 
have not previously been reported to associate and the recognition of both by a 
single TRA mAb suggests the Pfs47/Pfs230 complex is a new vaccine target. In 
total, Pfs230 was the dominant target antigen, with five of the eight TRA mAbs 
and 8 of 11 nonTRA gamete/zygote surface reactive mAbs interacting with Pfs230. 
Of the three remaining TRA mAbs, two recognized non-reduced, parasite-produced 
Pfs25 and one bound non-reduced, parasite-produced Pfs48/45. None of the TRA 
mAbs bound protein on an immunoblot of reduced gamete/zygote extract and two TRA 
mAbs were immunoblot negative, indicating none of the new TRA epitopes are 
linear. The identification of eight new TRA mAbs that bind epitopes not included 
in any of the constructs currently under advancement as transmission-blocking 
vaccine candidates may provide new targets worthy of further study.
