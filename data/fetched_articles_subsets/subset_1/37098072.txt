Human complex II is a key protein complex that links two essential 
energy-producing processes: the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative 
phosphorylation. Deficiencies due to mutagenesis have been shown to cause 
mitochondrial disease and some types of cancers. However, the structure of this 
complex is yet to be resolved, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the 
functional aspects of this molecular machine. Here, we have determined the 
structure of human complex II in the presence of ubiquinone at 2.86 Å resolution 
by cryoelectron microscopy, showing it comprises two water-soluble subunits, 
SDHA and SDHB, and two membrane-spanning subunits, SDHC and SDHD. This structure 
allows us to propose a route for electron transfer. In addition, clinically 
relevant mutations are mapped onto the structure. This mapping provides a 
molecular understanding to explain why these variants have the potential to 
produce disease.
