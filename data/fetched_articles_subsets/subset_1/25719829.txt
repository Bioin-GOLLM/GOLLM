BACKGROUND: hERG1 channels are aberrantly expressed in human cancers. The 
expression, functional role and clinical significance of hERG1 channels in 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is lacking.
METHODS: hERG1 expression was tested in PDAC primary samples assembled as tissue 
microarray by immunohistochemistry using an anti-hERG1 monoclonal antibody 
(α-hERG1-MoAb). The functional role of hERG1 was studied in PDAC cell lines and 
primary cultures. ERG1 expression during PDAC progression was studied in 
Pdx-1-Cre,LSL-Kras(G12D/+),LSL-Trp53(R175H/+) transgenic (KPC) mice. ERG1 
expression in vivo was determined by optical imaging using Alexa-680-labelled 
α-hERG1-MoAb.
RESULTS: (i) hERG1 was expressed at high levels in 59% of primary PDAC; (ii) 
hERG1 blockade decreased PDAC cell growth and migration; (iii) hERG1 was 
physically and functionally linked to the Epidermal Growth Factor-Receptor 
pathway; (iv) in transgenic mice, ERG1 was expressed in PanIN lesions, reaching 
high expression levels in PDAC; (v) PDAC patients whose primary tumour showed 
high hERG1 expression had a worse prognosis; (vi) the α-hERG1-MoAb could detect 
PDAC in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: hERG1 regulates PDAC malignancy and its expression, once validated 
in a larger cohort also comprising of late-stage, non-surgically resected cases, 
may be exploited for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in PDAC either ex vivo 
or in vivo.
