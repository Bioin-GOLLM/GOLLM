The field of drug metabolism has changed dramatically in the past generation. 
Two of the driving forces are the advances in analytical chemistry and our 
understanding of the biological systems. With regard to the former, the advances 
in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) are extremely impressive, and 
the speed of analysis has been increased even more with the recent developments 
in ultraperformance LC (UPLC). NMR analysis on a sub-microgram scale is not 
unusual, and the 2-dimensional methods are also very impressive. The biology 
underlying gene regulation is highly developed, and the recombinant methods have 
greatly facilitated progress in the field. Today it is common to design 
discovery and development efforts focused on critical human phenomena from the 
very start, with animal studies supporting the efficacy and safety efforts.
