The first metal complexes comprising amidino-guanidinate ligands have been 
prepared and structurally characterized, namely 
bis-[μ-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraisopropyl-1-(1-butyl-amidinato)guanidinato-κ3N1,N2:N2]bis-[(tetra-hydro-furan)lithium], 
[Li2(C18H37N4)2(C4H8O)2], (2), and 
[bis-(tetra-hydro-furan)-lithium]-di-μ-chlorido-{(N,N'-di-cyclo-hexyl-1-butyl-amidinato-κ2N1,N2)[N,N',N'',N'''-tetra-cyclo-hexyl-1-(1-butyl-amidinato)guanidinato-κ2N1,N2]holmate(III)}, 
[HoLiCl2(C4H8O)2(C17H31N2)(C30H53N4)], (3). The novel lithium 
amidino-guanidinate precursors Li[ n BuC(=NR)(NR)C(NR)2] [1: R = Cy 
(cyclo-hex-yl), 2: R = i Pr) were obtained by treatment of 
N,N'-diorganocarbodi-imides, R-N=C=N-R (R = i Pr, Cy), with 0.5 equivalents of 
n-butyl-lithium under well-defined reaction conditions. An X-ray diffraction 
study of 2 revealed a ladder-type dimeric structure in the solid state. Reaction 
of anhydrous holmium(III) chloride with in situ-prepared 2 afforded the 
unexpected holmium 'ate' complex [ n BuC(=NCy)(NCy)C(NCy)2]Ho[ n 
BuC(NCy)2](μ-Cl)2Li(THF)2 (3) in 71% yield. An X-ray crystal structure 
determination of 3 showed that this complex contains both an amidinate ligand 
and the new amidino-guanidinate ligand.
