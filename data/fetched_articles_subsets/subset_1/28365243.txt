The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in the central nervous system 
(CNS). A comprehensive understanding of BBB development has been hampered by 
difficulties in observing the differentiation of brain endothelial cells (BECs) 
in real-time. Here, we generated two transgenic zebrafish line, 
Tg(glut1b:mCherry) and Tg(plvap:EGFP), to serve as in vivo reporters of BBB 
development. We showed that barriergenesis (i.e. the induction of BEC 
differentiation) occurs immediately as endothelial tips cells migrate into the 
brain parenchyma. Using the Tg(glut1b:mCherry) transgenic line, we performed a 
genetic screen and identified a zebrafish mutant with a nonsense mutation in 
gpr124, a gene known to play a role in CNS angiogenesis and BBB development. We 
also showed that our transgenic plvap:EGFP line, a reporter of immature brain 
endothelium, is initially expressed in newly formed brain endothelial cells, but 
subsides during BBB maturation. Our results demonstrate the ability to visualize 
the in vivo differentiation of brain endothelial cells into the BBB phenotype 
and establish that CNS angiogenesis and barriergenesis occur simultaneously.
