The Caenorhabditis elegans adult hermaphrodite germline is surrounded by a thin 
tube formed by somatic sheath cells that support germ cells as they mature from 
the stem-like mitotic state through meiosis, gametogenesis, and ovulation. 
Recently, we discovered that the distal Sh1 sheath cells associate with mitotic 
germ cells as they exit the niche Gordon et al., 2020. Here, we report that 
these sheath-associated germ cells differentiate first in animals with 
temperature-sensitive mutations affecting germ cell state, and stem-like germ 
cells are maintained distal to the Sh1 boundary. We analyze several markers of 
the distal sheath, which is best visualized with endogenously tagged membrane 
proteins, as overexpressed fluorescent proteins fail to localize to distal 
membrane processes and can cause gonad morphology defects. However, such 
reagents with highly variable expression can be used to determine the relative 
positions of the two Sh1 cells, one of which often extends further distal than 
the other.
