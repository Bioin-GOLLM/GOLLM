Although TAM receptor tyrosine kinases play key roles in immune regulation, 
cancer metastasis, and viral infection, the relative importance of the two TAM 
ligands-Gas6 and Protein S-has yet to be resolved in any setting in vivo. We 
have now performed a genetic dissection of ligand function in the retina, where 
the TAM receptor Mer is required for the circadian phagocytosis of photoreceptor 
outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial cells. This process is severely 
attenuated in Mer mutant mice, which leads to photoreceptor death. We find that 
retinal deletion of either Gas6 or Protein S alone yields retinae with a normal 
number of photoreceptors. However, concerted deletion of both ligands fully 
reproduces the photoreceptor death seen in Mer mutants. These results 
demonstrate that Protein S and Gas6 function as independent, bona fide Mer 
ligands, and are, to a first approximation, interchangeable with respect to 
Mer-driven phagocytosis in the retina.
