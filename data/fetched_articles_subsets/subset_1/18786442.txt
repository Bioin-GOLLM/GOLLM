We report on a Malaysian kindred with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The proband was an 
8-year-old girl who presented with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the trunk at 
the age of 8 months and developed a brain recurrence at the age of 7 years, 
which was 5 years after remission. A younger sister later developed 
adrenocortical carcinoma at the age of 6 months. Their mother and maternal 
grandmother were diagnosed with breast cancer at the ages of 26 and 38 years, 
respectively. TP53 mutation detection in this family revealed a duplication of a 
GGCGTG motif starting at nucleotide 17579 in exon 10, resulting in an in-frame 
insertion of two amino acids between residues 334 and 336 in the tetramerization 
domain of the p53 protein. This mutation was found in the proband and her 
affected sister as well as her mother. In addition, the mutation was detected in 
two other siblings (a brother aged 3 years and a sister aged 18 months) who have 
not yet developed any malignancy. Sequencing of TP53 in the father and two other 
asymptomatic siblings revealed wild-type TP53. To our knowledge, this is a first 
report of a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family in Southeast Asia.
