Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most commonly inherited peripheral 
neuropathy. CMT disease signs include distal limb neuropathy, abnormal gaiting, 
exacerbation of neuropathy, sensory defects and deafness. We generated a novel 
line of CMT2E mice expressing an hNF-L(E397K) transgene, which displayed muscle 
atrophy of the lower limbs without denervation, proximal reduction in large 
caliber axons and decreased nerve conduction velocity. In this study, we showed 
that hNF-L(E397K) mice developed abnormal gait of the hind limbs. The 
identification of severe gaiting defects in combination with previously observed 
muscle atrophy, reduced axon caliber and decreased nerve conduction velocity 
suggests that hNF-L(E397K) mice recapitulate many of clinical signs associated 
with CMT2E. Therefore, hNF-L(E397K) mice provide a context for potential 
therapeutic intervention.
