Allele 4 of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε4) and hypertension are considered 
risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The detection of differences in 
cognitive function and brain networks between hypertensive patients who are APOE 
ε4 carriers and non-carriers may help in understanding how hypertension and risk 
genes cumulatively impair brain function, which could provide critical insights 
into the genetic mechanism by which hypertension serves as a potential risk 
factor for cognitive decline and even AD. Using behavioral data from 233 elderly 
hypertensive patients and neuroimaging data from 38 of them from Beijing, China; 
the study aimed to assess the effects of APOE ε4 on cognition and to explore 
related changes in functional connectivity. Cognitively, the patients with APOE 
ε4 showed decreased executive function, memory and language. In the MRI 
sub-cohort, the frontoparietal networks in the APOE ε4 carrier group exhibited 
an altered pattern, mainly in the left precentral regions, inferior frontal lobe 
and angular gyrus. More importantly, the decline of cognitive function was 
correlated with abnormal FC in the left precentral regions in APOE ε4 carriers. 
APOE ε4 aggravated the dysfunction in frontal and parietal regions in 
hypertensive patients. This highlights the importance of brain protection in 
hypertensive patients, especially those with a genetic risk of AD.
