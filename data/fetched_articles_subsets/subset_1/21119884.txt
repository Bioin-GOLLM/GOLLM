A large amount of energy produced by active aerobic metabolism is necessary for 
the cochlea to maintain its function. This makes the cochlea vulnerable to 
blockade of cochlear blood flow and interruption of the oxygen supply. Although 
certain forms of human idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss reportedly 
arise from ischemic injury, the pathological mechanism of cochlear 
ischemia-reperfusion injury has not been fully elucidated. Recent animal studies 
have shed light on the mechanisms of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion injury. It 
will help in the understanding of the pathology of cochlear ischemia-reperfusion 
injury to classify this injury into ischemic injury and reperfusion injury. 
Excitotoxicity, mainly observed during the ischemic period, aggravates the 
injury of primary auditory neurons. On the other hand, oxidative damage induced 
by hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide enhances cochlear reperfusion injury. This 
article briefly summarizes the generation mechanisms of cochlear 
ischemia-reperfusion injury and potential therapeutic targets that could be 
developed for the effective management of this injury type.
