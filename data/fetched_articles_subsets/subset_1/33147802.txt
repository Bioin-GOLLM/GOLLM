Understanding the link between agonist-induced phosphorylation of the mu-opioid 
receptor (MOR) and the associated physiological effects is critical for the 
development of novel analgesic drugs and is particularly important for 
understanding the mechanisms responsible for opioid-induced tolerance and 
addiction. The family of G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) play a pivotal role 
in such processes, mediating phosphorylation of residues at the C-tail of opioid 
receptors. Numerous strategies, such as phosphosite specific antibodies and mass 
spectrometry have allowed the detection of phosphorylated residues and the use 
of mutant knock-in mice have shed light on the role of GRK regulation in opioid 
receptor physiology. Here we review our current understanding on the role of 
GRKs in the actions of opioid receptors, with a particular focus on the MOR, the 
target of most commonly used opioid analgesics such as morphine or fentanyl.
