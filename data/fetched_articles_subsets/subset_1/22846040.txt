The p90 ribosomal S6 family of kinases (RSK) are potential drug targets, due to 
their involvement in cancer and other pathologies. There are currently only two 
known selective inhibitors of RSK, but the basis for selectivity is not known. 
One of these inhibitors is a naturally occurring 
kaempferol-α-L-diacetylrhamnoside, SL0101. Here, we report the crystal structure 
of the complex of the N-terminal kinase domain of the RSK2 isoform with SL0101 
at 1.5 Å resolution. The refined atomic model reveals unprecedented structural 
reorganization of the protein moiety, as compared to the nucleotide-bound form. 
The entire N-lobe, the hinge region, and the αD-helix undergo dramatic 
conformational changes resulting in a rearrangement of the nucleotide binding 
site with concomitant formation of a highly hydrophobic pocket spatially suited 
to accommodate SL0101. These unexpected results will be invaluable in further 
optimization of the SL0101 scaffold as a promising lead for a novel class of 
kinase inhibitors.
