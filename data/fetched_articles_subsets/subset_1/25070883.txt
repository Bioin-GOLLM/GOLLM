BACKGROUND: The frequency and molecular basis of the D variants have been 
reported in the Caucasian and African populations, but relatively little 
information was known in the Chinese population. Here, a study was investigated 
in Chinese persons with weak or discrepant D serologic typing.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: D variant was typed with a serologic method. The full 
coding regions of RHD of these variants were amplified with polymerase chain 
reaction and then directly sequenced. RHD zygosity test was performed using the 
hybrid Rhesus box technique and a multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplification (MLPA) assay was also used to analyze the variant alleles and RHD 
gene copy number.
RESULTS: Twelve distinct RHD mutation alleles were found in 32 D variant 
individuals, with eight weak D and four partial D alleles. Weak D Type 15 and 
DVI Type 3 were the major weak D and partial D alleles in Zhejiang Han persons. 
Three novel weak D alleles (RHD weak D 95A, 779G, and 670G) and one new partial 
D allele (RHD130-132 del TCT) were identified. The results of RHD zygosity in 
three individuals disagreed between the RHD zygosity test and the MLPA assay. 
The most known variant alleles can be detected, but four novel alleles were 
missed using the RH-MLPA assay.
CONCLUSION: The molecular basis and zygosity of D variants in Zhejiang Han 
persons were analyzed, and four novel RHD alleles were identified. These data 
extend the information of D variants and may help to improve the transfusion 
strategy of the D variants.
