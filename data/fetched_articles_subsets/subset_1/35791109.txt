Childhood glaucoma is a treatable cause of blindness, provided it is recognized, 
diagnosed, and treated in time. WHO has estimated that it is responsible for 
Blind Years second only to cataracts. The fundamental pathophysiology of all 
childhood glaucoma is impaired outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Anterior 
segment Dysgeneses (ASD) are a group of non-acquired ocular anomalies associated 
with glaucoma, characterized by developmental abnormalities of the tissues of 
the anterior segment. The cause is multifactorial, and many genes are involved 
in the development of the anterior segment. Over the last decade, molecular and 
developmental genetic research has transformed our understanding of the 
molecular basis of ASD and the developmental mechanisms underlying these 
conditions. Identifying the genetic changes underlying ASD has gradually led to 
the recognition that some of these conditions may be parts of a disease 
spectrum. The characterization of genes responsible for glaucoma is the critical 
first step toward developing diagnostic and screening tests, which could 
identify individuals at risk for disease before irreversible optic nerve damage 
occurs. It is also crucial for genetic counseling and risk stratification of 
later pregnancies. It also aids pre-natal testing by various methods allowing 
for effective genetic counseling. This review will summarize the known genetic 
variants associated with phenotypes of ASD and the possible significance and 
utility of genetic testing in the clinic.
