This study investigated the effects of adenosine (ADO) and adenosine 
5'-monophosphate (AMP) supplementation on the growth performance, carcass 
characteristics, meat quality, and lipid metabolism in adipose tissues of 
finishing pigs. The pigs were allocated to three treatment groups: the control 
diet, 0.2%ADO diet, or 0.2%AMP diet. Compared with CON group (CON), both ADO and 
AMP groups increased in carcass straight length (P < 0.05) and decreased in drip 
loss (P < 0.05), while AMP group tended to increase in redness value (P = 0.05) 
and decreased in free amino acid content in longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle 
(P < 0.05). Additionally, ADO or AMP supplementation increased the ADO or AMP 
content in serum, adipose tissue, and LT muscle (P < 0.05), as well as the 
protein level of adenosine 2A receptor (A2a) in adipose tissue (P < 0.05). 
Moreover, both ADO and AMP groups showed an increase in the expression of 
lipolysis genes (ATGL and HSL) in adipose tissue (P < 0.05). Overall, AMP 
supplementation could improve meat quality, and ADO and AMP supplementation 
regulate the lipid metabolism of finishing pigs.
