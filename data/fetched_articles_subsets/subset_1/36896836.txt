BACKGROUND: There is a lack of information on rare germline variants of 
pancreatic cancer-predisposing genes. Risk genes for multiple primary cancers 
may overlap with those for pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective study of autopsy cases with a negative family history 
in the Japanese single nucleotide polymorphism for geriatric research database 
examined rare germline variants in the protein-coding regions of 61 genes. 
Targeted sequencing of these genes was performed and classified for 
pathogenicity using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 
guidelines. Polyphen-2, SIFT and LoFtool algorithms were used to predict damage 
to protein function.
RESULTS: Of the 189 subjects used (90 cancer and 99 non-cancer controls), 72 
patients had pancreatic cancer (23 had multiple primary cancers) and 18 had no 
pancreatic cancer in multiple primary cancers. APC, BRCA2, BUB1B, ENG and MSH6 
were associated with cancer predisposition, and pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
(P/LP) variants occurred in 6% [pancreatic cancer (4/72); all-cancer (5/90)] and 
54% (49/90) carried only variants of uncertain significance (VUS) among cancer 
patients. Of these VUS, in pancreatic cancer patients, four DNA mismatch repair 
(MMR) genes ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 ), and POLQ in men were significantly 
associated (odds ratio = 3.83; P  = 0.025; P  = 0.027, respectively). The most 
abundant predictor of functionally damaging variants was POLQ .
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of P/LP variants in patients with sporadic pancreatic 
cancer suggests the need for genetic evaluation of individuals with no family 
history. VUS of MMR genes ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 ) and POLQ may be useful 
in predicting genetic trends in the potential risk of pancreatic cancer, 
especially in individuals lacking P/LP.
