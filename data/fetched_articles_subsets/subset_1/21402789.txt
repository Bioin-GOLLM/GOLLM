The immortal and totipotent properties of the germ line depend on determinants 
within the germ plasm. A common characteristic of germ plasm across phyla is the 
presence of germ granules, including P granules in Caenorhabditis elegans, which 
are typically associated with the nuclear periphery. In C. elegans, nuclear pore 
complex (NPC)-like FG repeat domains are found in the VASA-related P-granule 
proteins GLH-1, GLH-2, and GLH-4 and other P-granule components. We demonstrate 
that P granules, like NPCs, are held together by weak hydrophobic interactions 
and establish a size-exclusion barrier. Our analysis of intestine-expressed 
proteins revealed that GLH-1 and its FG domain are not sufficient to form 
granules, but require factors like PGL-1 to nucleate the localized concentration 
of GLH proteins. GLH-1 is necessary but not sufficient for the perinuclear 
location of granules in the intestine. Our results suggest that P granules 
extend the NPC environment in the germ line and provide insights into the roles 
of the PGL and GLH family proteins.
