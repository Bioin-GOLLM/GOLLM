Infertility affects 10% of reproductive-age women and is extremely heterogeneous 
in etiology. The genetic contribution to female infertility is incompletely 
understood, and involves chromosomal and single-gene defects. Our aim in this 
study is to decipher single-gene causes in infertile women in whom 
endocrinological, anatomical, and chromosomal causes have been excluded. Our 
cohort comprises women with recurrent pregnancy loss and no offspring from 
spontaneous pregnancies (RPL, n = 61) and those who never achieved clinical 
pregnancy and were referred for in vitro fertilization [primary infertility 
(PI), n = 14]. Whole-exome sequencing revealed candidate variants in 14, which 
represents 43% of those with PI and 13% of those with RPL. These include 
variants in previously established female infertility-related genes (TLE6, 
NLRP7, FSHR, and ZP1) as well as genes with only tentative links in the 
literature (NLRP5). Candidate variants in genes linked to primary ciliary 
dyskinesia (DNAH11 and CCNO) were identified in individuals with and without 
systemic features of the disease. We also identified variants in genes not 
previously linked to female infertility. These include one homozygous variant 
each in CCDC68, CBX3, CENPH, PABPC1L, PIF1, PLK1, and REXO4, which we propose as 
candidate genes for infertility based on their established biology or compatible 
animal models. Our study expands the contribution of single genes to the 
etiology of PI and RPL, improves the precision of disease classification at the 
molecular level, and offers the potential for future treatment and development 
of human genetics-inspired fertility regulators.
