Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the N332 supersite of the HIV 
envelope (Env) trimer are the most common bnAbs induced during infection, making 
them promising leads for vaccine design. Wild-type Env glycoproteins lack 
detectable affinity for supersite-bnAb germline precursors and are therefore 
unsuitable immunogens to prime supersite-bnAb responses. We employed mammalian 
cell surface display to design stabilized Env trimers with affinity for 
germline-reverted precursors of PGT121-class supersite bnAbs. The trimers 
maintained native-like antigenicity and structure, activated PGT121 
inferred-germline B cells ex vivo when multimerized on liposomes, and primed 
PGT121-like responses in PGT121 inferred-germline knockin mice. Design 
intermediates have levels of epitope modification between wild-type and 
germline-targeting trimers; their mutation gradient suggests sequential 
immunization to induce bnAbs, in which the germline-targeting prime is followed 
by progressively less-mutated design intermediates and, lastly, with native 
trimers. The vaccine design strategies described could be utilized to target 
other epitopes on HIV or other pathogens.
