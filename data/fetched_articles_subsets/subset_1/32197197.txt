We aimed to replicate a recent study that found a high frequency of the GBA 
p.K198E mutant in Colombian patients with PD. We identified the p.K198E 
substitution at a lower frequency in our cohort of Colombians with PD (2.1%), 
and this was not significantly different than controls (1.7%, P = 0.86) 
emphasizing the need for larger genetic studies in Latin America.
