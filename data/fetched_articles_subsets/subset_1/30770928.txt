Endometriotic lesions are composed in part of endometrial-like stromal cells, 
however, there is a shortage of immortalized human endometrial stromal cultures 
available for research. As genetic factors play a role in endometriosis risk, it 
is important that genotype is also incorporated into analysis of pathological 
mechanisms. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) immortalization 
(using Lenti-hTERT-green fluorescent protein virus) took place following 
genotype selection; 13 patients homozygous for either the risk or non-risk 
'other' allele for one or more important endometriosis risk single nucleotide 
polymorphism on chromosome 1p36.12 (rs3820282, rs56318008, rs55938609, 
rs12037376, rs7521902 or rs12061255). Short tandem repeat DNA profiling 
validated that donor tissue matched that of the immortalized cell lines and 
confirmed that cultures were genetically novel. Expression of morphological 
markers (vimentin and cytokeratin) and key genes of interest (telomerase, 
estrogen and progesterone receptors and LINC00339) were examined and functional 
assays for cell proliferation, steroid hormone and inflammatory responses were 
performed for 7/13 cultures. All endometrial stromal cell lines maintained their 
fibroblast-like morphology (vimentin-positive) and homozygous endometriosis-risk 
genotype following introduction of hTERT. Furthermore, the new stromal cultures 
demonstrated positive and diverse responses to hormones (proliferation and 
decidualisation changes) and inflammation (dose-dependent response), while 
maintaining hormone receptor expression. In conclusion, we successfully 
developed a range of human endometrial stromal cell lines that carry important 
endometriosis-risk alleles. The wider implications of this approach go beyond 
advancing endometriosis research; these cell lines will be valuable tools for 
multiple endometrial pathologies offering a level of genetic and phenotypic 
diversity not previously available.
