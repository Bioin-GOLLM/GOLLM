METHODS: Using a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system, EFTUD2 single allele knockout 
HepG2.2.15 cells were constructed. Subsequently, the HBV biomarkers in EFTUD2+/- 
HepG2.2.15 cells and wild-type (WT) cells with or without IFN-α treatment were 
detected. And the EFTUD2-regulated genes were then identified using mRNA 
sequence. Selected gene mRNA variants and their proteins were examined by 
qRT-PCR and Western blotting. To confirm the effects of EFTUD2 on HBV 
replication and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, a rescue experiment in 
EFTUD2+/- HepG2.2.15 cells was performed by EFTUD2 overexpression.
RESULTS: IFN-induced anti-HBV activity was found to be restricted in EFTUD2+/- 
HepG2.2.15 cells. The mRNA sequence showed that EFTUD2 could regulate classical 
IFN and virus response genes. Mechanistically, EFTUD2 single allele knockout 
decreased the expression of ISG-encoded proteins, comprising Mx1, OAS1, and PKR 
(EIF2AK2), through mediated gene splicing. However, EFTUD2 did not affect the 
expression of Jak-STAT pathway genes. Furthermore, EFTUD2 overexpression could 
restore the attenuation of IFN anti-HBV activity and the reduction of ISG 
resulting from EFTUD2 single allele knockout.
CONCLUSION: EFTUD2, the spliceosome factor, is not IFN-inducible but is an IFN 
effector gene. EFTUD2 mediates IFN anti-HBV effect through regulation of gene 
splicing for certain ISGs, including Mx1, OAS1, and PKR. EFTUD2 does not affect 
IFN receptors or canonical signal transduction components. Therefore, it can be 
concluded that EFTUD2 regulates ISGs using a novel, nonclassical mechanism.
