Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease 
among the elderly. To understand its pathogenesis and to test therapies, animal 
models that faithfully reproduce key pathological PD hallmarks are needed. As a 
prelude to developing a model of PD, we tested the tropism, efficacy, 
biodistribution, and transcriptional effect of canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) 
vectors in the brain of Microcebus murinus, a nonhuman primate that naturally 
develops neurodegenerative lesions. We show that introducing helper-dependent 
(HD) CAV-2 vectors results in long-term, neuron-specific expression at the 
injection site and in afferent nuclei. Although HD CAV-2 vector injection 
induced a modest transcriptional response, no significant adaptive immune 
response was generated. We then generated and tested HD CAV-2 vectors expressing 
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and LRRK2 carrying a G2019S mutation 
(LRRK2G2019S), which is linked to sporadic and familial autosomal dominant forms 
of PD. We show that HD-LRRK2G2019S expression induced parkinsonian-like motor 
symptoms and histological features in less than 4 months.
