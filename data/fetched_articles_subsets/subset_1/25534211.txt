OBJECTIVE: Since conflicting results have been published on the role of tobacco 
smoking on the risk of endometriosis, we provide an up-to-date summary 
quantification of this potential association.
DESIGN: We performed a PubMed/MEDLINE search of the relevant publications up to 
September 2014, considering studies on humans published in English. We searched 
the reference list of the identified papers to find other relevant publications. 
Case-control as well as cohort studies have been included reporting risk 
estimates on the association between tobacco smoking and endometriosis. 38 of 
the 1758 screened papers met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies 
included a total of 13,129 women diagnosed with endometriosis.
SETTING: Academic hospitals.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of endometriosis in tobacco smokers.
RESULTS: We obtained the summary estimates of the relative risk (RR) using the 
random effect model, and assessed the heterogeneity among studies using the χ(2) 
test and quantified it using the I(2) statistic. As compared to never-smokers, 
the summary RR were 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.08) for ever smokers, 0.95 (95% CI 
0.81 to 1.11) for former smokers, 0.92 (95% CI 0.82 to 1.04) for current 
smokers, 0.87 (95% CI 0.70 to 1.07) for moderate smokers and 0.93 (95% CI 0.69 
to 1.26) for heavy smokers.
CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis provided no evidence for an association 
between tobacco smoking and the risk of endometriosis. The results were 
consistent considering ever, former, current, moderate and heavy smokers, and 
across type of endometriosis and study design.
