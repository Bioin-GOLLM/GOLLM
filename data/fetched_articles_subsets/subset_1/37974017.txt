Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that lost several enzymes 
required in energy production. The expansion of transporter families in these 
organisms enables them to hijack ATP from hosts. In this study, nucleotide 
transporters of the microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), which 
causes slow growth in economically valuable Penaeus shrimp, were characterized. 
Analysis of the EHP genome suggested the presence of four putative nucleotide 
transporter genes, namely EhNTT1, EhNTT2, EhNTT3, and EhNTT4. Sequence alignment 
revealed four charged amino acids that are conserved in previously characterized 
nucleotide transporters. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that EhNTT1, 3, and 4 
were derived from one horizontal gene transfer event, which was independent from 
that of EhNTT2. Localization of EhNTT1 and EhNTT2 using immunofluorescence 
analysis revealed positive signals within the envelope of developing plasmodia 
and on mature spores. Knockdown of EhNTT2 by double administration of sequence 
specific double-stranded RNA resulted in a significant reduction in EHP copy 
numbers, suggesting that EhNTT2 is crucial for EHP replication in shrimp. Taken 
together, the insight into the roles of NTTs in microsporidian proliferation can 
provide the biological basis for the development of alternative control 
strategies for microsporidian infection in shrimp.
