OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular basis for an individual with a rare weak D 
phenotype.
METHODS: Serological methods were used to characterize the RhD blood group 
phenotype. The exons of RHD gene were amplified with PCR and sequenced. The 
presence of Rhesus box was tested by PCR to determine the homozygosity of RHD 
gene.
RESULTS: The RhD blood group of the proband was detected as weak D. The 10 exons 
of the RHD gene and Rhesus box could be amplified by PCR, and the genotype of 
RHD alleles was determined as RHD+/RHD-. The exons of the RHD gene were 
sequenced, and a 365C>T mutation in exon 3 was detected. Therefore, the RhD 
blood group of the proband was confirmed as weak D type 54 by both serological 
methods and DNA sequencing.
CONCLUSION: A weak D type 54 has been detected. A 365C>T mutation in RHD gene is 
responsible for the low expression of D antigen.
