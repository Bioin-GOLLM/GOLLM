AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: By genome-wide association meta-analysis, 17 genetic loci 
associated with fasting serum insulin (FSI), a marker of systemic insulin 
resistance, have been identified. To define potential culprit genes in these 
loci, in a cross-sectional study we analysed white adipose tissue (WAT) 
expression of 120 genes in these loci in relation to systemic and adipose tissue 
variables, and functionally evaluated genes demonstrating genotype-specific 
expression in WAT (eQTLs).
METHODS: Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained from 114 
women. Basal lipolytic activity was measured as glycerol release from adipose 
tissue explants. Adipocytes were isolated and insulin-stimulated incorporation 
of radiolabelled glucose into lipids was used to quantify adipocyte insulin 
sensitivity. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockout in human mesenchymal stem 
cells was used for functional evaluation of genes.
RESULTS: Adipose expression of 48 of the studied candidate genes associated 
significantly with FSI, whereas expression of 24, 17 and 2 genes, respectively, 
associated with adipocyte insulin sensitivity, lipolysis and/or WAT morphology 
(i.e. fat cell size relative to total body fat mass). Four genetic loci 
contained eQTLs. In one chromosome 4 locus (rs3822072), the FSI-increasing 
allele associated with lower FAM13A expression and FAM13A expression associated 
with a beneficial metabolic profile including decreased WAT lipolysis 
(regression coefficient, R = -0.50, p = 5.6 × 10-7). Knockdown of FAM13A 
increased lipolysis by ~1.5-fold and the expression of LIPE (encoding 
hormone-sensitive lipase, a rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis). At the 
chromosome 7 locus (rs1167800), the FSI-increasing allele associated with lower 
POM121C expression. Consistent with an insulin-sensitising function, POM121C 
expression associated with systemic insulin sensitivity (R = -0.22, 
p = 2.0 × 10-2), adipocyte insulin sensitivity (R = 0.28, p = 3.4 × 10-3) and 
adipose hyperplasia (R = -0.29, p = 2.6 × 10-2). POM121C knockdown decreased 
expression of all adipocyte-specific markers by 25-50%, suggesting that POM121C 
is necessary for adipogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Gene expression and adipocyte functional studies 
support the notion that FAM13A and POM121C control adipocyte lipolysis and 
adipogenesis, respectively, and might thereby be involved in genetic control of 
systemic insulin sensitivity.
