Cordyceps species are known to contain numerous bioactive compounds, including 
cordycepin. Extracts of Cordyceps militaris (CME) are used in diverse medicinal 
purposes because of their bioactive components. Cordycepin, one of the active 
components of CME, exhibits anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and 
anti-inflammatory effects. Cordycepin structurally differs from adenosine in 
that its ribose lacks an oxygen atom at the 3' position. We previously reported 
that cordycepin suppresses Epstein‚ÅªBarr virus (EBV) gene expression and lytic 
replication in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC). However, other studies 
reported that cordycepin induces EBV gene expression and lytic reactivation. 
Thus, it was reasonable to clarify the bioactive effects of CME bioactive 
compounds on the EBV life cycle. We first confirmed that CME preferentially 
induces EBV gene expression and lytic reactivation; second, we determined that 
adenosine in CME induces EBV gene expression and lytic reactivation; third, we 
discovered that the adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1) is required for adenosine to 
initiate signaling for upregulating BZLF1, which encodes for a key EBV regulator 
(Zta) of the EBV lytic cycle; finally, we showed that BZLF1 upregulation by 
adenosine leads to delayed tumor development in the EBVaGC xenograft mouse 
model. Taken together, these results suggest that adenosine is an EBV lytic 
cycle inducer that inhibits EBVaGC development.
