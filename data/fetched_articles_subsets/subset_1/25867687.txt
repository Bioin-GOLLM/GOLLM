The allelic distribution at Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R polymorphism determines 
differential sensitivity towards certain organophosphate pesticides. The alleles 
Q (Glutamine) and R (Arginine) at amino acid position 192 are responsible for 
the lower and higher activity of the enzyme towards paraoxon respectively, 
making knowledge of this distribution in different populations vital. This study 
reports the genotype and allele frequencies of the Gln192Arg polymorphism of 
PON1 in four populations of India, comprising two caste and two tribal groups 
hitherto unexamined for this polymorphism. The R allele frequencies in Jat, Meo, 
Santhal and Zeliangrong populations were found to be 0.47, 0.45, 0.54 and 0.51 
respectively. The gene diversity analyses show a high genetic differentiation at 
this locus indicative of the role of populations' history and other evolutionary 
forces. A comparison with allele frequencies among 106 populations from 
different continents showed a concordance with their geographic distribution 
which will have repercussions in policies targeting pesticide usage.
