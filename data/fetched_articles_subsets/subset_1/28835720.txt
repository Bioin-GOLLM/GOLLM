Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) arise as a late effect of chemotherapy 
and/or radiation administered for a primary condition, typically a malignant 
disease, solid organ transplant or autoimmune disease. Survival is measured in 
months, not years, making t-MN one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers. In 
this Review, we discuss recent developments that reframe our understanding of 
the genetic and environmental aetiology of t-MN. Emerging data are illuminating 
who is at highest risk of developing t-MN, why t-MN are chemoresistant and how 
we may use this information to treat and ultimately prevent this lethal disease.
