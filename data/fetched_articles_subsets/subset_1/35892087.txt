Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers, and the number of patients with 
intracranial metastases is increasing. Previously, we developed an enzyme 
prodrug suicide gene therapy based on the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase 
(HSV-TK)/ganciclovir (GCV) system using various mesenchymal stem cells to induce 
apoptosis in malignant gliomas through bystander killing effects. Here, we 
describe stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) as gene 
vehicles of the TK/GCV system against a brain metastasis model of non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC). We introduced the A168H mutant TK (TKA168H) into SHED to 
establish the therapeutic cells because of the latent toxicity of wild type. 
SHED expressing TKA168H (SHED-TK) exhibited chemotaxis to the conditioned medium 
of NSCLC and migrated toward implanted NSCLC in vivo. SHED-TK demonstrated a 
strong bystander effect in vitro and in vivo and completely eradicated H1299 
NSCLC in the brain. SHED-TK cells implanted intratumorally followed by GCV 
administration significantly suppressed the growth of H1299 and 
improved survival time. These results indicate that the TKA168H variant is 
suitable for establishing therapeutic cells and that intratumoral injection of 
SHED-TK followed by GCV administration may be a useful strategy for therapeutic 
approaches.
