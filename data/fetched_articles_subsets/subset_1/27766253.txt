Increased risk of developing autoimmune manifestations has been identified in 
different primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). In such conditions, autoimmunity 
and immune deficiency represent intertwined phenomena that reflect inadequate 
immune function. Autoimmunity in PIDs may be caused by different mechanisms, 
including defects of tolerance to self-antigens and persistent stimulation as a 
result of the inability to eradicate antigens. This general immune dysregulation 
leads to compensatory and exaggerated chronic inflammatory responses that lead 
to tissue damage and autoimmunity. Each PID may be characterized by distinct, 
peculiar autoimmune manifestations. Moreover, different pathogenetic mechanisms 
may underlie autoimmunity in PID. In this review, the main autoimmune 
manifestations observed in different PID, including humoral immunodeficiencies, 
combined immunodeficiencies, and syndromes with immunodeficiencies, are 
summarized. When possible, the pathogenetic mechanism underlying autoimmunity in 
a specific PID has been explained.
