The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is a significant genetic 
contributor to polygenic obesity. We investigated whether physical activity (PA) 
modulates the effect of FTO rs3751812 on body mass index (BMI) among Taiwanese 
adults. Analytic samples included 10,853 Taiwan biobank participants. 
Association of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with BMI was assessed 
using linear regression models. Physical activity was defined as any kind of 
exercise lasting 30 min each session, at least three times a week. Participants 
with heterozygous (TG) and homozygous (TT) genotypes had higher BMI compared to 
those with wild-type (GG) genotypes. The β value was 0.381(p < 0.0001) for TG 
individuals and 0.684 (p = 0.0204) for TT individuals. There was a significant 
dose-response effect among carriers of different risk alleles (p trend <0.0001). 
Active individuals had lower BMI than their inactive counterparts (β = -0.389, p 
< 0.0001). Among the active individuals, significant associations were found 
only with the TG genotype (β = 0.360, p = 0.0032). Inactive individuals with TG 
and TT genotypes had increased levels of BMI compared to those with GG 
genotypes: Their β values were 0.381 (p = 0.0021) and 0.950 (p = 0.0188), 
respectively. There was an interaction between the three genotypes, physical 
inactivity, and BMI (p trend  = 0.0002). Our data indicated that increased BMI 
owing to genetic susceptibility by FTO rs3751812 may be reduced by physical 
activity.
