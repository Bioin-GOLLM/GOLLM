Polygonum minus (syn. Persicaria minor) is a herbal plant that is well known for 
producing sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its flavour and fragrance. This 
study describes the cloning and functional characterisation of PmSTPS1 and 
PmSTPS2, two sesquiterpene synthase genes that were identified from P. minus 
transcriptome data mining. The full-length sequences of the PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 
genes were expressed in the E. coli pQE-2 expression vector. The sizes of 
PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 were 1098 bp and 1967 bp, respectively, with open reading 
frames (ORF) of 1047 and 1695 bp and encoding polypeptides of 348 and 564 amino 
acids, respectively. The proteins consist of three conserved motifs, namely, 
Asp-rich substrate binding (DDxxD), metal binding residues (NSE/DTE), and 
cytoplasmic ER retention (RxR), as well as the terpene synthase family 
N-terminal domain and C-terminal metal-binding domain. From the in vitro enzyme 
assays, using the farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) substrate, the PmSTPS1 enzyme 
produced multiple acyclic sesquiterpenes of β-farnesene, α-farnesene, and 
farnesol, while the PmSTPS2 enzyme produced an additional nerolidol as a final 
product. The results confirmed the roles of PmSTPS1 and PmSTPS2 in the 
biosynthesis pathway of P. minus, to produce aromatic sesquiterpenes.
