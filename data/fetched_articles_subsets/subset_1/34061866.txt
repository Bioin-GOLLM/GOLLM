Degeneration of macular photoreceptors is a prominent characteristic of 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) which leads to devastating and 
irreversible vision loss in the elderly population. In this exploratory study, 
the contribution of environmental factors on the progression of AMD pathology by 
probing the expression of candidate proteins was analyzed. Four hundred and 
sixty four participants were recruited in the study comprising of AMD (n = 277) 
and controls (n = 187). Genetics related data was analyzed to demonstrate the 
activities of daily living (ADL) by using regression analysis and statistical 
modeling, including contrast estimate, multinomial regression analysis in AMD 
progression. Regression analysis revealed contribution of smoking, alcohol, and 
sleeping hours on AMD by altered expression of IER-3, HTRA1, B3GALTL, LIPC and 
TIMP3 as compared to normal levels. Contrast estimate supports the gender 
polarization phenomenon in AMD by significant decreased expression of SLC16A8 
and LIPC in control population which was found to be unaltered in AMD patients. 
The smoking, food habits and duration of night sleeping hours also contributed 
in AMD progression as evident from multinomial regression analysis. Predicted 
model (prediction estimate = 86.7%) also indicated the crucial role of night 
sleeping hours along with the decreased expression of TIMP-3, IER3 and SLC16A8. 
Results revealed an unambiguous role of environmental factors in AMD progression 
mediated by various regulatory proteins which might result in intermittent AMD 
phenotypes and possibly influence the outcome of anti-VEGF treatment.
