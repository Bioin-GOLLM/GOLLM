Dental caries is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental 
factors, including dietary habits. Previous reports have characterized the 
influence of genetic variation on taste preferences and dietary habits. We 
therefore hypothesized that genetic variation in taste pathway genes (TAS2R38, 
TAS1R2, GNAT3) may be associated with dental caries risk and/or protection. 
Families were recruited by the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia 
(COHRA) for collection of biological samples, demographic data, and clinical 
assessment of oral health, including caries scores. Multiple single-nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) assays for each gene were performed and analyzed by 
transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analysis (FBAT software) for three 
dentition groups: primary, mixed, and permanent. Statistically significant 
associations were seen in TAS2R38 and TAS1R2 for caries risk and/or protection.
