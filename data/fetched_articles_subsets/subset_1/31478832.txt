Genetic polymorphism in the interferon lambda (IFN-λ) region is associated with 
spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and response to 
interferon-based treatment. Here, we evaluate associations between IFN-λ 
polymorphism and HCV variation in 8729 patients (Europeans 77%, Asians 13%, 
Africans 8%) infected with various viral genotypes, predominantly 1a (41%), 1b 
(22%) and 3a (21%). We searched for associations between rs12979860 genotype and 
variants in the NS3, NS4A, NS5A and NS5B HCV proteins. We report multiple 
associations in all tested proteins, including in the interferon-sensitivity 
determining region of NS5A. We also assessed the combined impact of human and 
HCV variation on pretreatment viral load and report amino acids associated with 
both IFN-λ polymorphism and HCV load across multiple viral genotypes. By 
demonstrating that IFN-λ variation leaves a large footprint on the viral 
proteome, we provide evidence of pervasive viral adaptation to innate immune 
pressure during chronic HCV infection.
