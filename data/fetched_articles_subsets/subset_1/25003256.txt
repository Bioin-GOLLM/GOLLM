CONTEXT: Genomic alterations play important roles in gastric cancer 
carcinogenesis. Cyclooxygenases (COX) are important enzymes in the maintenance 
of mucosal integrity and in pathological processes, mainly in inflammation and 
cancer. The -765G>C COX-2 polymorphism has been implicated in gastric cancer 
risk.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the COX-2 gene polymorphism as a predictor of gastric 
cancer risk.
METHODS: One hundred gastric cancer patients and 150 controls were enrolled from 
a Brazilian centre. Personal data regarding related risk factors, including 
alcohol consumption and smoking behavior, were collected via questionnaire. DNA 
was extracted from peripheral blood and the genotypes were analyzed using 
PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: G/G, G/C and C/C genotypes frequencies was 42.7%, 50% and 7.3%, 
respectively in controls and 59.0%, 34.0% and 7.0% in gastric cancer. The 
frequency of the genotypes differed between the groups (P = 0.033). A higher 
risk of gastric cancer was associated with COX-2 -765G/G genotype (P = 0.048; 
OR:1.98, 95% CI = 1.01-3.90). Alcohol consumption and smoking in patients with 
-765G/G genotype also increased the risk of gastric cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The -765G/G genotype and the -765G allele had been associated with 
an increased risk for gastric cancer. The presence of smoking and alcohol 
consumption increased the risk for gastric cancer in subjects with -765G/G 
genotype compared with the control group. Polymorphism of COX-2 gene and gastric 
cancer risk.
