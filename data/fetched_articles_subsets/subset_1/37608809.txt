Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide and Inflammation plays a critical role in the development of CVD. 
Despite considerable progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms and 
various treatment options available, significant gaps in therapy necessitate the 
identification of novel therapeutic targets. Sphingolipids are a family of 
lipids that have gained attention in recent years as important players in CVDs 
and the inflammatory processes that underlie their development. As preclinical 
studies have shown that targeting sphingolipids can modulate inflammation and 
ameliorate CVDs, targeting sphingolipids has emerged as a promising therapeutic 
strategy. This review discusses the current understanding of sphingolipids' 
involvement in inflammation and cardiovascular diseases, the existing 
therapeutic approaches and gaps in therapy, and explores the potential of 
sphingolipids-based drugs as a future avenue for CVD treatment.
