CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has been very effective in editing genes in 
many plant species including rice. Here we further improve the current 
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in both efficiency and time needed for 
isolation of transgene-free and target gene-edited plants. We coupled the 
CRISPR/Cas9 cassette with a unit that activates anthocyanin biosynthesis, 
providing a visible marker for detecting the presence of transgenes. The 
anthocyanin-marker assisted CRISPR (AAC) technology enables us to identify 
transgenic events even at calli stage, to select transformants with elevated 
Cas9 expression, and to identify transgene-free plants in the field. We used the 
AAC technology to edit LAZY1 and G1 and successfully generated many 
transgene-free and target gene-edited plants at T1 generation. The AAC 
technology greatly reduced the labor, time, and costs needed for editing target 
genes in rice.
