Insulin granule biogenesis involves transport to, and stable docking at, the 
plasma membrane before priming and fusion. Defects in this pathway result in 
impaired insulin secretion and are a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. We now show 
that the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatase Sac2 localizes to insulin 
granules in a substrate-dependent manner and that loss of Sac2 results in 
impaired insulin secretion. Sac2 operates upstream of granule docking, since 
loss of Sac2 prevented granule tethering to the plasma membrane and resulted in 
both reduced granule density and number of exocytic events. Sac2 levels 
correlated positively with the number of docked granules and exocytic events in 
clonal β cells and with insulin secretion in human pancreatic islets, and Sac2 
expression was reduced in islets from type 2 diabetic subjects. Taken together, 
we identified a phosphoinositide switch on the surface on insulin granules that 
is required for stable granule docking at the plasma membrane and impaired in 
human type 2 diabetes.
