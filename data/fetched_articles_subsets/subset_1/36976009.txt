Lassa virus (LASV) is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever epidemic in West 
Africa. In recent years, it has been transmitted several times to North America, 
Europe, and Asia. Standard reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and real-time RT-PCR 
are extensively used for early detection of LASV. However, the high nucleotide 
diversity of LASV strains complicates the development of appropriate diagnostic 
assays. Here, we analyzed LASV diversity clustered with geographic location and 
evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of two standard RT-PCR methods (GPC 
RT-PCR/1994 and 2007) and four commercial real-time RT-PCR kits (namely, Da an, 
Mabsky, Bioperfectus, and ZJ) to detect six representative LASV lineages using 
in vitro synthesized RNA templates. The results showed that the GPC RT-PCR/2007 
assay had better sensitivity compared to the GPC RT-PCR/1994 assay. The Mabsky 
and ZJ kits were able to detect all RNA templates of six LASV lineages. 
Contrastingly, the Bioperfectus and Da an kits failed to detect lineages IV and 
V/VI. The limit of detection for lineage I with the Da an, Bioperfectus, and ZJ 
kits were significantly higher than that of the Mabsky kit at an RNA 
concentration of 1 × 1010 to 1 × 1011 copies/mL. The Bioperfectus and Da an kits 
detected lineages II and III at an RNA concentration of 1 × 109 copies/mL, 
higher than that of the other kits. In conclusion, the GPC RT-PCR/2007 assay and 
the Mabsky kit were suitable assays for the detection of LASV strains based on 
good analytical sensitivity and specificity. IMPORTANCE Lassa virus (LASV) is a 
significant human pathogen causing hemorrhagic fever in West Africa. Increased 
traveling around the world raises the risk of imported cases to other countries. 
The high nucleotide diversity of LASV strains clustered with geographic location 
complicates the development of appropriate diagnostic assays. In this study, we 
showed that the GPC reverse transcription (RT)-PCR/2007 assay and the Mabsky kit 
are suitable for detecting most LASV strains. Future assays for molecular 
detection of LASV should be based on specific countries/regions along with new 
variants.
