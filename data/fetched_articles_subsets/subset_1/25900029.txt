To explore the interactions among immunity related genes and the risk of breast 
cancer (BC), 376 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast cases and 366 
healthy controls were selected into our study. Twenty single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) of five immunological genes in the CD28/B7 pathway were 
genotyped. Overall, five SNPs filtered by the Relief F algorithm were rs733618, 
rs11889031, rs4553808, rs4675374 and rs10754339. The best model of multifactor 
dimensionality reduction (MDR) contained rs733618 and rs11889031. The high risk 
genotype combination contributed to increasing risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 
(OR), 4.36; 95% confidence interval (CI); 3.15-6.02). The information gain (IG) 
value of these two SNPs was 8.07%, presented the strongest interaction effect. 
Five significant multiplicative interactions and seven significant combining 
effects were found among the filtered SNPs. Moreover, the filtered SNPs were 
still stable in the groups of ER(+), PR(+), CerbB2(-) and lymph node (LN) 
involvement positive with the best models including rs733618 and rs11889031. The 
most frequent haplotype was TACC which significantly increased breast cancer 
risk (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.43-2.25). These results suggested that interactions 
among cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4), inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) 
and B7H4 might play critical roles on the risk of breast cancer.
