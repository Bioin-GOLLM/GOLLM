Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer and has proven to be critical in 
viral infections. Metabolic reprogramming provides the cell with energy and 
biomass for large-scale biosynthesis. Based on studies of the cellular changes 
that contribute to metabolic reprogramming, seven main hallmarks can be 
identified: (1) increased glycolysis and lactic acid, (2) increased 
glutaminolysis, (3) increased pentose phosphate pathway, (4) mitochondrial 
changes, (5) increased lipid metabolism, (6) changes in amino acid metabolism, 
and (7) changes in other biosynthetic and bioenergetic pathways. Viruses depend 
on metabolic reprogramming to increase biomass to fuel viral genome replication 
and production of new virions. Viruses take advantage of the non-metabolic 
effects of metabolic reprogramming, creating an anti-apoptotic environment and 
evading the immune system. Other non-metabolic effects can negatively affect 
cellular function. Understanding the role metabolic reprogramming plays in viral 
pathogenesis may provide better therapeutic targets for antivirals.
