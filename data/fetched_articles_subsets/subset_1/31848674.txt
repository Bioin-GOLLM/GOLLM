PURPOSE: In vivo tau-PET tracer retention in the anterior temporal lobe of 
patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV PPA) has 
consistently been reported. This is unexpected as the majority of these patients 
have frontotemporal lobar degeneration TDP (FTLD-TDP).
METHODS: We conducted an in vitro [18F]AV1451 autoradiography binding study in 
five cases with a clinical diagnosis of SV PPA constituting the range of 
pathologies (i.e., three FTLD-TDP, one Alzheimer's disease (AD), and one Pick's 
disease (PiD)). Binding was compared with two controls without 
neurodegeneration, two typical AD, one corticobasal syndrome with underlying AD, 
and one frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant with FTLD-TDP. The effect of 
blocking with the authentic reference material and with the MAO-B inhibitor 
deprenyl was assessed. Immunohistochemistry was performed on adjacent 
cryosections.
RESULTS: Absence of specific [18F]AV1451 binding was observed for all three SV 
PPA FTLD-TDP cases. The absence of binding in controls as well as the successful 
blocking with authentic AV1451 in cases with tauopathy demonstrated specificity 
of the [18F]AV1451 signal for tau. The specific [18F]AV1451 binding was highest 
in AD, followed by PiD. This binding colocalized with the respective tau lesions 
and could not be blocked by deprenyl. Similar pilot findings were obtained with 
[18F]THK5351.
CONCLUSION: In vitro autoradiography showed no [18F]AV1451 binding in SV PPA due 
to FTLD-TDP, while specific binding was present in SV PPA due to AD and PiD. The 
discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo findings remains to be explained. The 
discordance is not related to [18F]AV1451 idiosyncrasies as [18F]THK5351 
findings were similar.
