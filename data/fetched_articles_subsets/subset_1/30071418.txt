Suicide is a major public health concern. A significant proportion of depressed 
individuals show suicidal ideation. The currently available medications are not 
optimal and a large number of depressed/suicidal patients do not respond to 
these medications. Thus, there is an urgent need to fully understand the 
neurobiological mechanisms associated with depression and suicidal behavior and 
to find novel targets for therapeutic interventions. In this regard, microRNAs 
(miRNAs), member of small non-coding RNA family, have emerged as an invaluable 
tool not only to understand disease pathogenesis but also to precisely pinpoint 
the targets that can be developed as drugs. In this review, these aspects have 
been discussed in a comprehensive and critical manner.
