Sylvatic dengue viruses (DENV) are both evolutionarily and ecologically distinct 
from human DENV and are maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle. Evidence 
of sylvatic human infections from West Africa and Southeast Asia suggests that 
sylvatic DENV come into regular contact with humans. Thus, this potential of 
emergence into the human transmission cycle could limit the potential for 
eradicating this cycle with vaccines currently in late stages of development. We 
assessed the likelihood of sylvatic DENV-4 emergence in the face of natural 
immunity to current human strains and vaccination with two DENV-4 vaccine 
candidates. Our data indicate homotypic neutralization of sylvatic and human 
DENV-4 strains by human primary convalescent and vaccinee sera but limited 
heterotypic immunity. These results suggest that emergence of sylvatic strains 
into the human cycle would be limited by homotypic immunity mediated by virus 
neutralizing antibodies produced by natural infection or vaccination.
