Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CDLS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous 
developmental disorder characterized by multiple malformations. Primarily, 
affected individuals have unique and recognizable dysmorphic facial features, 
cleft palate, distal limb defects, growth retardation, and developmental delay. 
However, also milder, as well as slightly phenotypically different forms exist. 
We described herein a patient with CDLS5, an X-linked form, caused by mutations 
in the HDAC8 gene inherited form the mosaic mother. Analysis of results from 
whole exome sequencing identified two variants with possible impact on the 
phenotype. Of them, hemizygous variant (c.938G>A, p.Arg313Gln) inherited from 
the mosaic mother, was further proved to lead to disease in the proband. Our 
intention was to delineate this syndrome but also point out the clinical course 
of the disease, which only in combination with a facial phenotype allow for 
verification of exome sequencing result.
