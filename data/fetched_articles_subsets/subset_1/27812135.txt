NOD2 contributes to the innate immune response and to the homeostasis of the 
intestinal mucosa. In response to its bacterial ligand, NOD2 interacts with RICK 
and activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, inducing gene transcription and 
synthesis of proteins required to initiate a balanced immune response. Mutations 
in NOD2 have been associated with an increased risk of Crohn's Disease (CD), a 
disabling inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because NOD2 signaling plays a key 
role in CD, it is important to further characterize the network of protein 
interacting with NOD2. Using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screens, we identified new 
NOD2 interacting proteins (NIP). The primary interaction was confirmed by 
coimmunoprecipitation and/or bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) 
experiments for 11 of these proteins (ANKHD1, CHMP5, SDCCAG3, TRIM41, LDOC1, 
PPP1R12C, DOCK7, VIM, KRT15, PPP2R3B, and C10Orf67). These proteins are involved 
in diverse functions, including endosomal sorting complexes required for 
transport (ESCRT), cytoskeletal architecture and signaling regulation. 
Additionally, we show that the interaction of 8 NIPs is compromised with the 3 
main CD associated NOD2 mutants (R702W, G908R and 1007fs). Furthermore, to 
determine whether these NOD2 protein partners could be encoded by IBD 
susceptibility genes, a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was performed on 
101 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the main corresponding haplotypes 
in genes coding for 15 NIPs using a set of 343 IBD families with 556 patients. 
Overall this work did not increase the number of IBD susceptibility genes but 
extends the NOD2 protein interaction network and suggests that NOD2 interactome 
and signaling depend upon the NOD2 mutation profile in CD.
