Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of living brain tissue down to an 
individual synapse level would create opportunities for decoding the dynamics 
and structure-function relationships of the brain's complex and dense 
information processing network; however, this has been hindered by insufficient 
3D resolution, inadequate signal-to-noise ratio and prohibitive light burden in 
optical imaging, whereas electron microscopy is inherently static. Here we 
solved these challenges by developing an integrated optical/machine-learning 
technology, LIONESS (live information-optimized nanoscopy enabling saturated 
segmentation). This leverages optical modifications to stimulated emission 
depletion microscopy in comprehensively, extracellularly labeled tissue and 
previous information on sample structure via machine learning to simultaneously 
achieve isotropic super-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio and compatibility 
with living tissue. This allows dense deep-learning-based instance segmentation 
and 3D reconstruction at a synapse level, incorporating molecular, activity and 
morphodynamic information. LIONESS opens up avenues for studying the dynamic 
functional (nano-)architecture of living brain tissue.
