OBJECTIVE: To determine whether electronic health record (EHR) tools improve 
documentation of pre- and postanalytic care processes for genetic tests ordered 
by nongeneticists.
METHODS: We conducted a nonrandomized, controlled, pre-/postintervention study 
of EHR point-of-care tools (informational messages and template report) for 
three genetic tests. Chart review assessed documentation of genetic testing 
processes of care, with points assigned for each documented item. Multiple 
linear and logistic regressions assessed factors associated with documentation.
RESULTS: Preimplementation, there were no significant site differences (P > 
0.05). Postimplementation, mean documentation scores increased (5.9 (2.1) vs. 
5.0 (2.2); P = 0.0001) and records with clinically meaningful documentation 
increased (score >5: 59 vs. 47%; P = 0.02) at the intervention versus the 
control site. Pre- and postimplementation, a score >5 was positively associated 
with abnormal test results (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.8-9.2) and trainee provider (OR 
= 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2-4.6). Postimplementation, a score >5 was also positively 
associated with intervention site (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1-5.1) and specialty 
clinic (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.1-3.6). There were also significantly fewer tests 
ordered after implementation (264/100,000 vs. 204/100,000; P = 0.03), with no 
significant change at the control site (280/100,000 vs. 257/100,000; P = 0.50).
CONCLUSIONS: EHR point-of-care tools improved documentation of genetic testing 
processes and decreased utilization of genetic tests commonly ordered by 
nongeneticists.Genet Med 19 1, 112-120.
