BACKGROUND: Mutations in different genes including dystrophin-associated 
glycoprotein complex caused familial dilated cardiomyopathy which is a 
genetically heterogeneous disease. The δ-SG gene contains nine exons spanning a 
433-kb region of genomic DNA. It encodes a 35-kDa, singlepass, and type II 
transmembrane glycoprotein.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study for the first time in Iran we screened 6 
patients of a large family that they had positive family history of MI or sudden 
death by next generation sequencing method.
RESULTS: By employing NGS method we found missense mutation (p.R97Q) of δ-SG 
gene in 2 of 6 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The missense mutation (p.R97Q) in familial DCM patients is reported 
for the first time in Iranian patients with cardiac disease. Although this 
mutation is already known in other populations in Iran, it is not reported 
before.
