BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) ranks among the most common causes of 
death worldwide. Because SCA is most often lethal, yet mostly occurs in 
individuals without previously known cardiac disease, the identification of 
patients at risk for SCA could save many lives. In unselected SCA victims from 
the community, common genetic variants (which are not disease-causing per se, 
but may increase susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation) are found to be 
associated with increased SCA risk. However, whether rare genetic variants 
contribute to SCA risk in the community is largely unexplored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We here investigated the involvement of rare genetic 
variants in SCA risk at the population level by studying the prevalence of 6 
founder genetic variants present in the Dutch population (PLN-p.Arg14del, 
MYBPC3-p.Trp792fsX17, MYBPC3-p.Arg943X, MYBPC3-p.Pro955fsX95, PKP2-p.Arg79X, and 
the Chr7q36 idiopathic ventricular fibrillation risk haplotype) in a cohort of 
1440 unselected Dutch SCA victims included in the Amsterdam Resuscitation Study 
(ARREST). The six studied founder mutations were found to be more prevalent 
(1.1%) in the ARREST SCA cohort compared with an ethnically and geographically 
matched set of controls (0.4%, n=1379; P<0.05) or a set of Dutch individuals 
drawn from the Genome of the Netherlands (GoNL) study (0%, n=500; P<0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: This finding provides proof-of-concept for the notion that rare 
genetic variants contribute to some extent to SCA risk in the community.
