PURPOSE: This study examined the central auditory processing (CAP) assessment 
results of adults between 45 and 85 years of age with probable pre-clinical 
Alzheimer's disease - i.e., individuals with subjective memory complaints (SMCs) 
as compared to those who were not reporting significant levels of memory 
complaints (non-SMCs). It was hypothesized that the SMC group would perform 
significantly poorer on tests of central auditory skills compared to 
participants with non-SMCs (control group).
METHODS: A total of 95 participants were recruited from the larger Western 
Australia Memory Study and were classified as SMCs (N = 61; 20 males and 41 
females, mean age 71.47 ±7.18 years) and non-SMCs (N = 34; 10 males, 24 females, 
mean age 68.85 ±7.69 years). All participants completed a peripheral hearing 
assessment, a CAP assessment battery including Dichotic Digits, Duration Pattern 
Test, Dichotic Sentence Identification, Synthetic Sentence Identification with 
Ipsilateral Competing Message (SSI-ICM) and the Quick-Speech-in-Noise, and a 
cognitive screening assessment.
RESULTS: The SMCs group performed significantly poorer than the control group on 
SSI-ICM -10 and -20 dB signal-to-noise conditions. No significant differences 
were found between the two groups on the peripheral hearing threshold 
measurements and other CAP assessments.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that individuals with SMCs perform poorly on 
specific CAP assessments in comparison to the controls. The poor CAP in SMC 
individuals may result in a higher cost to their finite pool of cognitive 
resources. The CAP results provide yet another biomarker that supports the 
hypothesis that SMCs may be a primary indication of neuropathological changes in 
the brain. Longitudinal follow up of individuals with SMCs, and decreased CAP 
abilities should inform whether this group is at higher risk of developing 
dementia as compared to non-SMCs and those SMC individuals without CAP 
difficulties.
