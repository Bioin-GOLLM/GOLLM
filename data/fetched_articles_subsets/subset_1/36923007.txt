Gene pathway enrichment analysis is a widely used method to analyze whether a 
gene set is statistically enriched on certain biological pathway network. 
Current gene pathway enrichment methods commonly consider local importance of 
genes in pathways without considering the interactions between genes. In this 
paper, we propose a gene pathway enrichment method (GIGSEA) based on improved 
TF-IDF algorithm. This method employs gene interaction data to calculate the 
influence of genes based on the local importance in a pathway as well as the 
global specificity. Computational experiment result shows that, compared with 
traditional gene set enrichment analysis method, our proposed method in this 
paper can find more specific enriched pathways related to phenotype with higher 
efficiency.
