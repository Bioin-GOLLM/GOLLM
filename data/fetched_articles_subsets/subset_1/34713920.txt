The integrity of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) is essential for normal brain 
functions, synaptic remodeling, and angiogenesis. BBB disruption is a common 
pathology during Parkinson's disease (PD), and has been hypothesized to 
contribute to the progression of PD. However, the molecular mechanism of BBB 
disruption in PD needs further investigation. Here, A53T PD mouse and a 3-cell 
type in vitro BBB model were used to study the roles of α-synuclein (α-syn) in 
BBB disruption with the key results confirmed in the brains of PD patients 
obtained at autopsy. The A53T PD mouse studies showed that the expression of 
tight junction-related proteins decreased, along with increased vascular 
permeability and accumulation of oligomeric α-syn in activated astrocytes in the 
brain. The in vitro BBB model studies demonstrated that treatment with 
oligomeric α-syn, but not monomeric or fibrillar α-syn, resulted in significant 
disruption of BBB integrity. This process involved the expression and release of 
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and nitric oxide (NO) from 
oligomeric α-syn treated astrocytes. Increased levels of VEGFA and iNOS were 
also observed in the brain of PD patients. Blocking the VEGFA signaling pathway 
in the in vitro BBB model effectively protected the barrier against the harmful 
effects of oligomeric α-syn. Finally, the protective effects on BBB integrity 
associated with inhibition of VEGFA signaling pathway was also confirmed in PD 
mice. Taken together, our study concluded that oligomeric α-syn is critically 
involved in PD-associated BBB disruption, in a process that is mediated by 
astrocyte-derived VEGFA.
