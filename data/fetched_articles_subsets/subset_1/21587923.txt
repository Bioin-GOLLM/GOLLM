In the title mol-ecule, C(18)H(17)FN(2), the imidazole ring is essentially 
planar [maximum deviation of 0.005 (1) Å and makes dihedral angles of 72.33 (8) 
and 18.71 (8)° with the methyl-phenyl and fluoro-phenyl rings, respectively. The 
dihedral angle between the two benzene rings is 75.05 (7)°. The crystal packing 
is stabilized by inter-molecular C-H⋯N hydrogen bonds.
