histidine (F8(92) ).

A presumably spontaneous mutation has resulted in the formation of Hemoglobin 
(Hb) Istanbul in which glutamine is substituted for histidine in the proximal 
position of the beta-chain (F8(92)). The anemia and other physiological effects 
that occur in the presence of Hb Istanbul were much ameliorated by splenectomy. 
Hb Istanbul is a relatively unstable molecule which produces a rather moderate 
case of "unstable hemoglobin hemolytic anemia."In the determination of 
structure, a method of preferential cleavage of an aspartyl-proline bond at 
residues 99-100 of the beta-chain was used.
