Studies on the pathogenesis of murine experimental autoimmune active hepatitis: 
sensitized T cell involvement in its induction.

Araki K, Yamamoto H, Fujimoto S.

Experimental autoimmune hepatitis was induced in B10.A(5R) mice sensitized by 
repeated intramuscular injections of syngeneic liver antigens emulsified with 
complete Freund's adjuvant. A 300R X-irradiation followed by two more injections 
after the sixth intramuscular sensitization to the mice resulted in active 
hepatitis with severe piecemeal necrosis. An intravenous adoptive transfer of 
spleen cells from the sensitized mice into normal syngeneic mice caused 
hepatitis in recipients which was characterized by extensive focal hepatic cell 
necrosis in the lobules. The transfer of spleen cells treated with monoclonal 
anti-Thy-1.2 antibody plus complement failed to induce hepatitis, while the 
transfer of T cell-enriched spleen cells by the panning method using rabbit 
anti-mouse immunoglobulin-coated dishes caused a somewhat more severe hepatitis 
than that caused by the transfer of whole spleen cells of the sensitized mice.
