Extracellular matrix (ECM) provides fundamental support for epithelial tissues 
and controls cell function. The chemistry and mechanical properties of ECM 
components, including stiffness, elasticity, and fibrillar organization, 
influence epithelial tissue responses. Here we present a protocol describing the 
culture and transfer of epithelial acini from Matrigel to collagen gel and an 
approach to axially align the collagen fibrils by the external gel stretching. 
This protocol uses the acini of MCF10A cells and needs to be modified for 
different cell lines. For complete details on the use and execution of this 
protocol, please refer to Katsuno-Kambe et al. (2021).1.
