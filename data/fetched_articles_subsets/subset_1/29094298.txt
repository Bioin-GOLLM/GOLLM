Various data have demonstrated inadequate glycemic control amongst Asians with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), possibly on account of suboptimal titration of 
basal insulin-an issue which needs to be further examined. Here we review the 
available global and Asia-specific data on titration of basal insulin, with a 
focus on the use of insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Gla-100). We also discuss 
clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of titrating Gla-100, different 
approaches to titration, including some of the latest technological 
advancements, and guidance on the titration of basal insulin from international 
and local Asian guidelines. The authors also provide their recommendations for 
the initiation and titration of basal insulin for Asian populations. Discussion 
of the data included in this review and in relation to the authors' clinical 
experience with treating T2DM in Asian patients is also included. Briefly, 
clinical studies demonstrate the achievement of adequate glycemic control in 
adults with T2DM through titration of Gla-100. However, studies investigating 
approaches to titration, specifically in Asian populations, are lacking and need 
to be conducted. Given that the management of insulin therapy is a 
multidisciplinary team effort involving endocrinologists, primary care 
physicians, nurse educators, and patients, greater resources and education 
targeted at these groups are needed regarding the optimal titration of basal 
insulin. Technological advancements in the form of mobile or web-based 
applications for automated dose adjustment can aid different stakeholders in 
optimizing the dose of basal insulin, enabling a larger number of patients in 
Asia to reach their target glycemic goals with improved outcomes.
