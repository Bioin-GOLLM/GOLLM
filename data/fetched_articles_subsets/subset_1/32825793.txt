In sheep, the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 7 (CHCHD7) 
gene and the pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) are on the same growth-related 
major quantitative trait locus, positioned head-to-head approximately 420 bp 
apart on chromosome 9. PLAG1 affects sheep growth, but the effects of CHCHD7 
have not been determined. In this study, an 8-bp deletion downstream of CHCHD7 
was analyzed in 2350 sheep from seven breeds. The associations between the 
deletion and growth traits of Tan sheep were also determined. Both genotypes 
(homozygous wild-type and heterozygous) for the 8-bp deletion were found in Tan 
(TS), Luxi Blackhead (LXBH), Small-Tail Han (STHS), and Lanzhou Fat-Tail (LFTS) 
sheep. However, there were no polymorphic sites for the mutation in Hu (HS), 
Sartuul (SS), and Australian White (AUW) sheep. In TS, LXBH, STHS, and LFTS 
sheep, the deletion genotype was less frequent than the wild-type genotype, and 
the allele frequencies of the deletion variant were 0.007 (TS), 0.011 (LBXH), 
0.008 (STHS), and 0.010 (LFTS). The 8-bp deletion was significantly associated 
with body length (p = 0.032), chest depth (p = 0.015), and chest width (p = 
0.047) in Tan sheep. Thus, the 8-bp deletion downstream of the CHCHD7 gene might 
be associated with growth and development traits of sheep.
