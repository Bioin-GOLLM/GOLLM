BACKGROUND: We reported that zinc neurotoxicity, a key mechanism of ischemic 
neuronal death, was mediated by poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) 
over-activation following NAD(+)/ATP depletion in cortical cultures. Because 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can be activated by ATP depletion, and AMPK 
plays a key role in excitotoxicity and ischemic neuronal death, we examined 
whether AMPK could be involved in zinc neurotoxicity in mouse cortical neuronal 
cultures.
RESULTS: Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, significantly attenuated zinc-induced 
neuronal death. Activation of AMPK was detected beginning 2 h after a 10-min 
exposure of mouse cortical neurons to 300 μM zinc, although a significant change 
in AMP level was not detected until 4 h after zinc treatment. Thus, AMPK 
activation might not have been induced by an increase in intracellular AMP in 
zinc neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we observed that liver kinase B1 (LKB1) but not 
Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), was involved in 
AMPK activation. Although STO-609, a chemical inhibitor of CaMKKβ, significantly 
attenuated zinc neurotoxicity, zinc-induced AMPK activation was not affected, 
which suggested that CaMKKβ was not involved in AMPK activation. Knockdown of 
LKB1 by siRNA significantly reduced zinc neurotoxicity, as well as zinc-induced 
AMPK activation, which indicated a possible role for LKB1 as an upstream kinase 
for AMPK activation. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of Bim, a 
pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, were noticeably increased by zinc in an 
AMPK-dependent manner. Finally, caspase-3 activation in zinc-induced neuronal 
death was mediated by LKB1 and AMPK activation.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that AMPK mediated zinc-induced neuronal 
death via up-regulation of Bim and activation of caspase-3. Rapid activation of 
AMPK was detected after exposure of cortical neuronal cultures to zinc, which 
was induced by LKB1 activation but not increased intracellular AMP levels or 
CaMKKβ activation. Hence, blockade of AMPK in the brain may protect against zinc 
neurotoxicity, which is likely to occur after acute brain injury.
