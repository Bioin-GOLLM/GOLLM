INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence has implicated perituberal, MRI-normal brain 
tissue as a possible source of seizures in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). 
Data on aberrant structural features in this area that may predispose to the 
initiation or progression of seizures are very limited. We used 
immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to compare epileptogenic, 
perituberal, MRI-normal tissue with cortical tubers.
RESULTS: In every sample of epileptogenic, perituberal tissue, we found many 
abnormal cell types, including giant cells and cytomegalic neurons. The majority 
of giant cells were surrounded by morphologically abnormal astrocytes with long 
processes typical of interlaminar astrocytes. Perituberal giant cells and 
astrocytes together formed characteristic "microtubers". A parallel analysis of 
tubers showed that many contained astrocytes with features of both protoplasmic 
and gliotic cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Microtubers represent a novel pathognomonic finding in TSC and may 
represent an elementary unit of cortical tubers. Microtubers and cytomegalic 
neurons in perituberal parenchyma may serve as the source of seizures in TSC and 
provide potential targets for therapeutic and surgical interventions in TSC.
