Despite the huge clinical success of antiretroviral therapy, several factors 
such as side effects, requirement of life-long adherence, high cost, incomplete 
access to therapies and development of drug resistance make the quest for an 
ultimate cure of HIV/AIDS a worldwide priority of biomedical research. In this 
respect, several sterilizing or functional cures have been reported in the last 
years in both non-human primates and humans. This review provides a summary of 
the main results achieved so far, outlining their strengths as well as their 
limitations. A synthetic interpretation of these results could be pivotal in 
order to develop an effective and widely available cure.
