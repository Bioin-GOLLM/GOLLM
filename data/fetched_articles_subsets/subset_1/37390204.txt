Deleterious variants in N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (NPL) cause skeletal 
myopathy and cardiac edema in humans and zebrafish, but its physiological role 
remains unknown. We report generation of mouse models of the disease: NplR63C, 
carrying the human p.Arg63Cys variant, and Npldel116 with a 116-bp exonic 
deletion. In both strains, NPL deficiency causes drastic increase in free sialic 
acid levels, reduction of skeletal muscle force and endurance, slower healing 
and smaller size of newly formed myofibers after cardiotoxin-induced muscle 
injury, increased glycolysis, partially impaired mitochondrial function, and 
aberrant sialylation of dystroglycan and mitochondrial LRP130 protein. 
NPL-catalyzed degradation of sialic acid in the muscle increases after fasting 
and injury and in human patient and mouse models with genetic muscle dystrophy, 
demonstrating that NPL is essential for muscle function and regeneration and 
serves as a general marker of muscle damage. Oral administration of 
N-acetylmannosamine rescues skeletal myopathy, as well as mitochondrial and 
structural abnormalities in NplR63C mice, suggesting a potential treatment for 
human patients.
