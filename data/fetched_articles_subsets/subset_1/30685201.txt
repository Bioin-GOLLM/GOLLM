BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: High serum interferon alpha (IFN-α) is an important 
heritable phenotype in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) which is involved in 
primary disease pathogenesis. High vs. low levels of IFN-α are associated with 
disease severity and account for some of the biological heterogeneity between 
SLE patients. The aim of the study was to replicate and fine-map previously 
detected genetic associations with serum IFN-α in SLE.
METHODS: We previously undertook a case-case genome-wide association study of 
SLE patients stratified by ancestry and extremes of phenotype in serum IFN-α. 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven loci identified in this screen 
were selected for follow up in a large independent cohort of 1370 SLE patients 
(703 European-ancestry, 432 African ancestry, and 235 Amerindian ancestry). Each 
ancestral background was analyzed separately, and ancestry-informative markers 
were used to control for ancestry and admixture.
RESULTS: We find a rare haplotype spanning the promoter region of EFNA5 that is 
strongly associated with serum IFN-α in both African-American and 
European-American SLE patients (OR = 3.0, p = 3.7 × 10-6). We also find SNPs in 
the PPM1H, PTPRM, and NRGN regions associated with IFN-α levels in 
European-American, Amerindian, and African-American SLE patients respectively. 
Many of these associations are within regulatory regions of the gene, suggesting 
an impact on transcription.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the power of molecular sub-phenotypes to 
reveal genetic factors involved in complex autoimmune disease. The distinct 
associations observed in different ancestral backgrounds emphasize the 
heterogeneity of molecular pathogenesis in SLE.
