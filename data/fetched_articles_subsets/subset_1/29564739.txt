PURPOSE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex multifactorial endocrine 
disorder affecting approximately 5-10% of women of reproductive age. Affected 
women have menstrual disturbances due to anovulation, infertility, and 
hyperandrogenism. Ovarian androgen overproduction is the key physiopathologic 
feature of PCOS. A number of genes encoding major enzymes of the androgen 
metabolic pathways, such as HSD17B6, CYP19A1, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and INSR, have 
been examined. Very few studies have been done in North India. There is an 
increasing prevalence of PCOS in women in Punjab and it is the leading cause of 
female infertility. In view of the strong evidence implicating the importance of 
CYP19A1 and CYP17A1 in androgen metabolic pathways, we investigated the 
association of rs700519, rs2414096, and rs743572 (- 34T>C) polymorphisms on 
susceptibility of developing PCOS, in North India.
METHODS: A total of 500 subjects (women of reproductive age) including 250 PCOS 
cases and 250 healthy age-matched controls were included in the present study. 
DNA was extracted from venous blood for all samples, and association analysis 
for rs2414096, rs700519, and rs743572 was done by polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Lipid 
profile was done using a biochemical analyzer and body mass index (BMI) was 
measured for all cases. Statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Significant association of - 34T>C polymorphism of CYP17A1 was found 
with PCOS (p = 0.0005). BMI was statistically different between PCOS cases and 
controls (p = 0.000). Triglycerides were high in PCOS women. Variations of 
CYP19A1 were not statistically significant with PCOS.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that - 34T>C polymorphism in CYP17A1 is 
associated with PCOS in North India. No polymorphism of CYP19A1 was found to be 
associated.
