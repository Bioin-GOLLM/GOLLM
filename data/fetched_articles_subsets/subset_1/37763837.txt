Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as the prevailing 
method for near-atomic structure determination, shedding light on the important 
molecular mechanisms of biological macromolecules. However, the inherent 
dynamics and structural variability of biological complexes coupled with the 
large number of experimental images generated by a cryo-EM experiment make data 
processing nontrivial. In particular, ab initio reconstruction and atomic model 
building remain major bottlenecks that demand substantial computational 
resources and manual intervention. Approaches utilizing recent innovations in 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly deep learning, have the 
potential to overcome the limitations that cannot be adequately addressed by 
traditional image processing approaches. Here, we review newly proposed AI-based 
methods for ab initio volume generation, heterogeneous 3D reconstruction, and 
atomic model building. We highlight the advancements made by the implementation 
of AI methods, as well as discuss remaining limitations and areas for future 
development.
