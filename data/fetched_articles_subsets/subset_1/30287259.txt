BACKGROUND: Autoantibodies against GPIHBP1, the endothelial cell transporter for 
lipoprotein lipase (LPL), cause severe hypertriglyceridemia ("GPIHBP1 
autoantibody syndrome"). Affected patients have low serum GPIHBP1 and LPL 
levels. We report the development of a sensitive and specific ELISA, suitable 
for routine clinical use, to detect GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in serum and plasma.
METHODS: Serum and plasma samples were added to wells of an ELISA plate that had 
been coated with recombinant human GPIHBP1. GPIHBP1 autoantibodies bound to 
GPIHBP1 were detected with an HRP-labeled antibody against human immunoglobulin. 
Sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the ELISA was evaluated with 
plasma or serum samples from patients with the GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome.
RESULTS: A solid-phase ELISA to detect and quantify GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in 
human plasma and serum was developed. Spiking recombinant human GPIHBP1 into the 
samples reduced the ability of the ELISA to detect GPIHBP1 autoantibodies. The 
ELISA is reproducible and sensitive; it can detect GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in 
samples diluted by >1000-fold.
CONCLUSION: We have developed a sensitive and specific ELISA for detecting 
GPIHBP1 autoantibodies in human serum and plasma; this assay will make it 
possible to rapidly diagnose the GPIHBP1 autoantibody syndrome.
