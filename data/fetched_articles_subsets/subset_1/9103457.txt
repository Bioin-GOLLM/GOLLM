A series of mutants of human IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) has been designed 
by comparison of IL-1ra and IL-1beta structures in order to increase receptor 
antagonist capacity. Upon in vitro and in vivo assay of IL-1 antagonism, the 
IL-1ra mutants DoB 0039 (N91-->R), DoB 0040 (T109-->A) and DoB 0041 
(N91/T109-->R/A) could inhibit IL-1beta effects more efficiently than wild-type 
IL-1ra, with DoB 0041 being the most active. Analysis of the receptor-binding 
capacity of the IL-1ra mutants showed that all three mutants could inhibit 
binding of IL-1alpha or IL-1beta to IL-1RI-bearing cells more efficiently than 
wild-type IL-1ra. Conversely, binding of IL-1beta to IL-1RII-bearing cells could 
be inhibited by DoB 0041 much less efficiently than by wild-type IL-1ra. It is 
known that the two types of IL-1 receptors (IL-1RI and IL-1RII) play different 
roles in the regulation of IL-1 activity, with IL-1RI being solely responsible 
for cell triggering upon IL-1 binding, whereas IL-1RII acts as a scavenger of 
IL-1 and can thus be considered as a natural IL-1 inhibitor. Thus, the enhanced 
inhibitory capacity of DoB 0041 as compared with wild-type IL-1ra is explained 
in terms of better binding to the activating receptor IL-1RI and poorer 
interaction with the inhibitory receptor IL-1RII.
