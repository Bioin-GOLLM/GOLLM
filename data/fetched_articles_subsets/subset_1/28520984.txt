INTRODUCTION: Genetic variants associated with nicotine dependence have 
previously been identified, primarily in European-ancestry populations. No 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been reported for smoking behaviors 
in Hispanics/Latinos in the United States and Latin America, who are of mixed 
ancestry with European, African, and American Indigenous components.
METHODS: We examined genetic associations with smoking behaviors in the Hispanic 
Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (N = 12 741 with smoking 
data, 5119 ever-smokers), using ~2.3 million genotyped variants imputed to the 
1000 Genomes Project phase 3. Mixed logistic regression models accounted for 
population structure, sampling, relatedness, sex, and age.
RESULTS: The known region of CHRNA5, which encodes the α5 cholinergic nicotinic 
receptor subunit, was associated with heavy smoking at genome-wide significance 
(p ≤ 5 × 10-8) in a comparison of 1929 ever-smokers reporting cigarettes per day 
(CPD) > 10 versus 3156 reporting CPD ≤ 10. The functional variant rs16969968 in 
CHRNA5 had a p value of 2.20 × 10-7 and odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 for the minor 
allele (A); its minor allele frequency was 0.22 overall and similar across 
Hispanic/Latino background groups (Central American = 0.17; South American = 
0.19; Mexican = 0.18; Puerto Rican = 0.22; Cuban = 0.29; Dominican = 0.19). 
CHRNA4 on chromosome 20 attained p < 10-4, supporting prior findings in 
non-Hispanics. For nondaily smoking, which is prevalent in Hispanic/Latino 
smokers, compared to daily smoking, loci on chromosomes 2 and 4 achieved 
genome-wide significance; replication attempts were limited by small 
Hispanic/Latino sample sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: Associations of nicotinic receptor gene variants with smoking, 
first reported in non-Hispanic European-ancestry populations, generalized to 
Hispanics/Latinos despite different patterns of smoking behavior.
IMPLICATIONS: We conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) of smoking behavior in a US Hispanic/Latino cohort, and the first GWAS of 
daily/nondaily smoking in any population. Results show that the region of the 
nicotinic receptor subunit gene CHRNA5, which in non-Hispanic European-ancestry 
smokers has been associated with heavy smoking as well as cessation and 
treatment efficacy, is also significantly associated with heavy smoking in this 
Hispanic/Latino cohort. The results are an important addition to understanding 
the impact of genetic variants in understudied Hispanic/Latino smokers.
