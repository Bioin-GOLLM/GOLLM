Human dual-specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7/Pyst2) is a 320-residue protein that 
belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP) subfamily of 
dual-specificity phosphatases. Although its precise biological function is still 
not fully understood, previous reports have demonstrated that DUSP7 is 
overexpressed in myeloid leukemia and other malignancies. Therefore, there is 
interest in developing DUSP7 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents, 
especially for cancer. Here, the purification, crystallization and structure 
determination of the catalytic domain of DUSP7 (Ser141-Ser289/C232S) at 1.67 Ã… 
resolution are reported. The structure described here provides a starting point 
for structure-assisted inhibitor-design efforts and adds to the growing 
knowledge base of three-dimensional structures of the dual-specificity 
phosphatase family.
