Cytokines are molecules that play critical roles in the regulation of a wide 
range of normal functions leading to cellular proliferation, differentiation and 
survival, as well as in specialized cellular functions enabling host resistance 
to pathogens. Cytokines released in response to infection, inflammation or 
immunity can also inhibit cancer development and progression. The predominant 
intracellular signaling pathway triggered by cytokines is the JAK-signal 
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Knockout mice and 
clinical human studies have provided evidence that JAK-STAT proteins regulate 
the immune system, and maintain immune tolerance and tumor surveillance. 
Moreover, aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT pathways plays an undeniable 
pathogenic role in several types of human cancers. Thus, in combination, these 
observations indicate that the JAK-STAT proteins are promising targets for 
cancer therapy in humans. The data supporting this view are reviewed herein.
