Results of PrP gene analysis in 5 of 9 members from a Jewish Tunisian family 
with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) showed a mutation at codon 200 involving 
substitution of lysine (Lys200) for glutamic acid (Glu200). This observation 
suggests that Lys200 allele probably tracks with CJD in this family and supports 
the possible genetic basis of the disease in the Mediterranean cluster. A second 
PrP variant not associated with Lys200 allele involving a short deletion in the 
coding sequence has also been found in only one subject.
