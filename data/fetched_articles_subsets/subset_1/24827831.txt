APOBEC3A (A3A), one of the seven-member APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases, 
lacks strong antiviral activity against lentiviruses but is a potent inhibitor 
of adeno-associated virus and endogenous retroelements. In this report, we 
characterize the biochemical properties of mammalian cell-produced and 
catalytically active E. coli-produced A3A. The enzyme binds to single-stranded 
DNA with a Kd of 150 nM and forms dimeric and monomeric fractions. A3A, unlike 
APOBEC3G (A3G), deaminates DNA substrates nonprocessively. Using a panel of 
oligonucleotides that contained all possible trinucleotide contexts, we 
identified the preferred target sequence as TC (A/G). Based on a 
three-dimensional model of A3A, we identified a putative binding groove that 
contains residues with the potential to bind substrate DNA and to influence 
target sequence specificity. Taking advantage of the sequence similarity to the 
catalytic domain of A3G, we generated A3A/A3G chimeric proteins and analyzed 
their target site preference. We identified a recognition loop that altered A3A 
sequence specificity, broadening its target sequence preference. Mutation of 
amino acids in the predicted DNA binding groove prevented substrate binding, 
confirming the role of this groove in substrate binding. These findings shed 
light on how APOBEC3 proteins bind their substrate and determine which sites to 
deaminate.
