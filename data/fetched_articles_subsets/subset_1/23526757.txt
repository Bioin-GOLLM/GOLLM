The use of breast MRI at 3 tesla (T) has increased in use substantially in 
recent years. Potential benefits of moving to higher field strength MRI include 
improved morphologic and kinetic assessment of breast lesions through higher 
spatial and temporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MR examinations. 
Furthermore, higher field strength holds promise for the development of superior 
advanced breast MRI techniques, such as diffusion weighted imaging and MR 
spectroscopy. To fully realize the benefits of moving to 3T, a thorough 
understanding of the technical and safety challenges of higher field strength 
imaging specific to breast MRI is paramount. Through the use of advanced coil 
technology, parallel imaging, dual-source parallel radiofrequency excitation, 
and image-based shimming techniques, many of these limiting technical factors 
can be overcome to achieve high quality breast MRI at 3T.
