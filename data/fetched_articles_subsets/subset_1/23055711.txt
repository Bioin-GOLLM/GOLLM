A genetic contribution to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
is well established. However, the specific genes responsible for enhanced risk 
or host differences in susceptibility to smoke exposure remain poorly 
understood. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive literature 
overview on the genetics of COPD, highlight the most promising findings during 
the last few years, and ultimately provide an updated COPD gene list. Candidate 
gene studies on COPD and related phenotypes indexed in PubMed before January 5, 
2012 are tabulated. An exhaustive list of publications for any given gene was 
looked for. This well-documented COPD candidate-gene list is expected to serve 
many purposes for future replication studies and meta-analyses as well as for 
reanalyzing collected genomic data in the field. In addition, this review 
summarizes recent genetic loci identified by genome-wide association studies on 
COPD, lung function, and related complications. Assembling resources, 
integrative genomic approaches, and large sample sizes of well-phenotyped 
subjects is part of the path forward to elucidate the genetic basis of this 
debilitating disease.
