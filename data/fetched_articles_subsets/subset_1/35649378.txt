Cholinergic interneurons (ChINs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been 
implicated in the extinction of drug associations, as well as related plasticity 
in medium spiny neurons (MSNs). However, since most previous work relied on 
artificial manipulations, whether endogenous acetylcholine signaling relates to 
drug associations is unclear. Moreover, despite great interest in the opposing 
effects of dopamine on MSN subtypes, whether ChIN-mediated effects vary by MSN 
subtype is also unclear. Here, we find that high endogenous acetylcholine event 
frequency correlates with greater extinction of cocaine-context associations 
across male mice. Additionally, extinction is associated with a weakening of 
glutamatergic synapses across MSN subtypes. Manipulating ChIN activity 
bidirectionally controls both the rate of extinction and the associated 
plasticity at MSNs. Our findings indicate that NAc ChINs mediate drug-context 
extinction by reducing glutamatergic synaptic strength across MSN subtypes, and 
that natural variation in acetylcholine signaling may contribute to individual 
differences in extinction.
