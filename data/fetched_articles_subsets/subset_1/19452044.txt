Biallelic mutations in the NBS1 gene are responsible for the Nijmegen breakage 
syndrome (NBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chromosome 
instability and hypersensitivity to ionising radiation (IR). Epidemiological 
data evidence that the NBS1 gene can be considered a susceptibility factor for 
cancer development, as demonstrated by the fact that almost 40% of NBS patients 
have developed a malignancy before the age of 21. Interestingly, also NBS1 
heterozygotes, which are clinically asymptomatic, display an elevated risk to 
develop some types of malignant tumours, especially breast, prostate and 
colorectal cancers, lymphoblastic leukaemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). 
So far, nine mutations in the NBS1 gene have been found, at the heterozygous 
state, in cancer patients. Among them, the 657del5, the I171V and the R215W 
mutations are the most frequently described. The pathogenicity of these 
mutations is presumably connected with their occurrence in the highly conserved 
BRCT tandem domains of the NBS1 protein, which are present in a large 
superfamily of proteins, and are recognized as major mediators of processes 
related to cell-cycle checkpoint and DNA repair.This review will focus on the 
current state-of-knowledge regarding the correlation between carriers of NBS1 
gene mutations and the proneness to the development of malignant tumours.
