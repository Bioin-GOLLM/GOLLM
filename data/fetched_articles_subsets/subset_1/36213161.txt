Background: Ibrutinib is widely known as an effective and well-tolerated 
therapeutical choice of the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). However, 
acquired resistance may occur during the treatment, causing relapse. Early 
detection of ibrutinib resistance is an important issue, therefore we aimed to 
find phenotypic markers on CLL cells the expression of which may correlate with 
the appearance of ibrutinib resistance. Methods: We examined 28 patients' 
peripheral blood (PB) samples (treatment naïve, ibrutinib sensitive, clinically 
ibrutinib resistant). The surface markers' expression (CD27, CD69, CD86, CD184, 
CD185) were measured by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the BTKC481S resistance 
mutation was assessed by digital droplet PCR. Moreover, the CLL cells' phenotype 
of a patient with acquired ibrutinib resistance was observed during the 
ibrutinib treatment. Results: The expression of CD27 (p = 0.030) and CD86 (p = 
0.031) became higher in the clinically resistant cohort than in the ibrutinib 
sensitive cohort. Besides, we found that high CD86 and CD27 expressions were 
accompanied by BTKC481S mutation. Our prospective study showed that the increase 
of the expression of CD27, CD69 and CD86 was noticed ahead of the clinical 
resistance with 3 months. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the changes of the 
expression of these markers could indicate ibrutinib resistance and the 
examination of these phenotypic changes may become a part of the patients' 
follow-up in the future.
