BACKGROUND: While use of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduces the risk of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes and lowers glycosylated 
haemoglobin (A1C), evidence on patient characteristics associated with 
clinically relevant A1C reduction is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to identify 
patient characteristics associated with A1C reduction with initial GLP-1 or 
SGLT-2 use.
METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and a baseline A1C ≥7% who were dispensed 
a GLP-1 or SGLT-2 between 01/01/10 and 12/31/17 were included. Patients were 
categorized as having a ≥1% or <1% A1C reduction during the 90-365 days after 
GLP-1/SGLT-2 initiation. Patient characteristics were collected during the 180 
days prior to initiation. Multivariable logistic and linear regression modelling 
was performed to identify characteristics associated with a ≥1% A1C reduction 
and absolute change in A1C, respectively.
RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-two patients were included with 261 (46%) and 
311 (54%) having and not having an ≥1% A1C reduction. Patients were primarily 
middle-aged, female, white, non-Hispanic and had a high burden of chronic 
disease. Characteristics associated with a ≥1% A1C reduction included: 
GLP-1/SGLT-2 persistence, congestive heart failure comorbidity, phentermine 
dispensing, care management team (CMT) enrollee and higher baseline A1C. 
Characteristics associated with absolute A1C reduction included: age, baseline 
A1C, CMT enrollee, GLP-1/SGLT-2 persistence and a phentermine dispensing.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide practitioners with guidance on 
the patients who are most likely to have a clinically relevant A1C reduction 
with GLP-1 or SGLT-2 use.
