Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. 
This is in part due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease, which often 
results in late-stage diagnosis, at which point there are limited treatment 
options. Even when treated successfully, gastric cancer patients have a high 
risk of tumor recurrence and acquired drug resistance. It is vital to gain a 
better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying gastric cancer 
pathogenesis to facilitate the design of new-targeted therapies that may improve 
patient survival. A number of chemically and genetically engineered mouse models 
of gastric cancer have provided significant insight into the contribution of 
genetic and environmental factors to disease onset and progression. This review 
outlines the strengths and limitations of current mouse models of gastric cancer 
and their relevance to the pre-clinical development of new therapeutics.
