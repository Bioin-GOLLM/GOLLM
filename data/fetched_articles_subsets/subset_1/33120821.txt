RATIONALE: Although vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) is commonly associated with 
high morbidity and high recurrence rate, effective diagnostic and prognostic 
biomarkers of VO are still lacking.
PATIENTS CONCERNS: Case 1: a 60-year-old male had had upper back pain for 3 
days. Case 2: a 71-year-old female presented upper back pain for 2 days.
DIAGNOSES: Based on physical examination and findings of magnetic resonance 
imaging and findings by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of 
flight mass spectrometry, they were diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus VO.
INTERVENTIONS: Using Sengenics Immunome Protein Array by analyzing 
autoantibodies in both VO patients, potential biomarkers of VO were explored.
OUTCOMES: Four subjects with more than 1600 antigens screened while the results 
showed that 14-3-3 protein gamma, pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase, 
fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, and keratin type II cytoskeletal 8 were highly 
differentially expressed among VO and controls. Relevant auto-antibody profiles 
were discovered after intra-group and inter-group comparison, and based on 
functional rationality, an adapter protein 14-3-3 protein gamma, and 
pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase that involved in tetrahydrobiopterin 
biosynthesis, might serve as valuable diagnostic biomarkers.
LESSONS: This pilot study on 4 subjects with more than 1600 antigens screened on 
the Sengenics Immunome protein array provided a general outlook on autoantibody 
biomarker profiles of VO subjects. Future large-scale trials with longer 
follow-up times are warranted.
