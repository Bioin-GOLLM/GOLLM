Sterol 14α-demethylases (CYP51s) are phylogenetically the most conserved 
cytochromes P450, and their three-step reaction is crucial for biosynthesis of 
sterols and serves as a leading target for clinical and agricultural antifungal 
agents. The structures of several (bacterial, protozoan, fungal, and human) 
CYP51 orthologs, in both the ligand-free and inhibitor-bound forms, have been 
determined and have revealed striking similarity at the secondary and tertiary 
structural levels, despite having low sequence identity. Moreover, in contrast 
to many of the substrate-promiscuous, drug-metabolizing P450s, CYP51 structures 
do not display substantial rearrangements in their backbones upon binding of 
various inhibitory ligands, essentially representing a snapshot of the 
ligand-free sterol 14α-demethylase. Here, using the obtusifoliol-bound I105F 
variant of Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51, we report that formation of the 
catalytically competent complex with the physiological substrate triggers a 
large-scale conformational switch, dramatically reshaping the enzyme active site 
(3.5-6.0 Å movements in the FG arm, HI arm, and helix C) in the direction of 
catalysis. Notably, our X-ray structural analyses revealed that the substrate 
channel closes, the proton delivery route opens, and the topology and 
electrostatic potential of the proximal surface reorganize to favor interaction 
with the electron-donating flavoprotein partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 
reductase. Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acid residues involved in 
these events revealed a key role of active-site salt bridges in contributing to 
the structural dynamics that accompanies CYP51 function. Comparative analysis of 
apo-CYP51 and its sterol-bound complex provided key conceptual insights into the 
molecular mechanisms of CYP51 catalysis, functional conservation, 
lineage-specific substrate complementarity, and druggability differences.
