Human neurohormone vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in overlapping regions in 
the hypothalamus. It is mainly known for its vasoconstricting abilities, and it 
is responsible for the regulation of plasma osmolality by maintaining fluid 
homeostasis. Over years, many attempts have been made to modify this hormone and 
find AVP analogues with different pharmacological profiles that could overcome 
its limitations. Non-peptide AVP analogues with low molecular weight presented 
good affinity to AVP receptors. Natural peptide counterparts, found in animals, 
are successfully applied as therapeutics; for instance, lypressin used in 
treatment of diabetes insipidus. Synthetic peptide analogues compensate for the 
shortcomings of AVP. Desmopressin is more resistant to proteolysis and presents 
mainly antidiuretic effects, while terlipressin is a long-acting AVP analogue 
and a drug recommended in the treatment of varicose bleeding in patients with 
liver cirrhosis. Recently published results on diverse applications of AVP 
analogues in medicinal practice, including potential lypressin, terlipressin and 
ornipressin in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, are discussed.
