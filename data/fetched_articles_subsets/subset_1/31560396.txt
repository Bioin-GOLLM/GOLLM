Hypoxia is associated with several diseases, including cancer. Cells that are 
deprived of adequate oxygen supply trigger transcriptional and 
post-transcriptional responses, which control cellular pathways such as 
angiogenesis, proliferation, and metabolic adaptation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) 
are a novel class of mainly non-coding RNAs, which have been implicated in 
multiple cancers and attract increasing attention as potential biomarkers. Here, 
we characterize the circRNA signatures of three different cancer cell lines from 
cervical (HeLa), breast (MCF-7), and lung (A549) cancer under hypoxia. In order 
to reliably detect circRNAs, we integrate available tools with custom approaches 
for quantification and statistical analysis. Using this consolidated 
computational pipeline, we identify ~12000 circRNAs in the three cancer cell 
lines. Their molecular characteristics point to an involvement of complementary 
RNA sequences as well as trans-acting factors in circRNA biogenesis, such as the 
RNA-binding protein HNRNPC. Notably, we detect a number of circRNAs that are 
more abundant than their linear counterparts. In addition, 64 circRNAs 
significantly change in abundance upon hypoxia, in most cases in a cell 
type-specific manner. In summary, we present a comparative circRNA profiling in 
human cancer cell lines, which promises novel insights into the biogenesis and 
function of circRNAs under hypoxic stress.
