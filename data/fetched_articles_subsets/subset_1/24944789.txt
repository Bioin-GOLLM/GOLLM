Genetic variations are linked to DNA repair ability and varied drug metabolism 
that largely affects the prognosis of antineoplastic agents, including platinum. 
The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to determine the roles of the 
genetic variants of the nucleotide excision repair genes on the prognosis of 
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
A meta-analysis was performed, including 44 original studies with a total number 
of 5,944 patients with NSCLC according to the search strategy. The tumor 
responses [complete response, partial response, stable disease (SD) and 
progressive disease (PD)] were estimated and the Stata package was used for the 
comprehensive quantitative analyses. The results showed that the XPG C46T 
polymorphism was significantly associated with tumor chemotherapy when SD or PD 
was considered as a non-response [TT vs. CC: risk ratio (RR), 1.31; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.14-1.5; and P=0.00; TT/CT vs. CC: RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 
1.11-1.36; and P=0.00; and TT vs.
CC/CT: RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36; and P=0.00]. No significant association 
between the ERCC1 C118T/C8092A XPDLys751Gln and XPA A23G polymorphisms and tumor 
response was found. There was also no evidence found to support the use of the 
ERCC1 C118T/C8092A XPDLys751Gln and XPA A23G polymorphisms as prognostic 
predictors of platinum-based chemotherapies in NSCLC in the meta-analysis. For 
the XPG C46T polymorphisms, a significant association with an objective response 
was detected. Multiple and large-scale studies are required to further 
investigate the association between biomarkers and tumor prognosis.
