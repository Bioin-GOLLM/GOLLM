AIM: To develop an autophagy-gene-based signature that could help to anticipate 
the therapeutic effects of Colorectal Cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We downloaded the gene expression profiles of CRC samples from the 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Genes 
with significant prognostic value in CRC were screened through univariate Cox 
regression analysis, while the LASSO Cox regression method was applied to screen 
optimal genes to construct the autophagy-related prognostic signature.
RESULTS: 11 autophagy genes were identified and selected for the establishment 
of prognosis prediction model for CRC patients. The CRC patients were classified 
into the low- and high-risk groups according to the optimal cutoff value. The 
time-dependent ROC curves indicated the good performance of this model in 
prognosis prediction, with AUC values of 0.66, 0.66, and 0.67 at 1, 3 and 5 
years for TCGA samples, as well as AUC values of 0.63, 0.65 and 0.64 for GEO 
samples, respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results 
confirmed risk score as the independent marker for prognosis prediction in CRC. 
Besides, the constructed nomogram also had high predictive value. The results 
analysis on the tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) relative ratios and mRNA 
levels of key immune checkpoint receptors indicated the signature was closely 
related to immune microenvironment of CRC in the context of TIICs and immune 
checkpoint receptors' mRNA level. The proportion of MSI-L + MSI-H in the 
high-risk group was higher than that in the low-risk group. Moreover, the tumor 
purity was evaluated by estimate function package suggested that lower tumor 
purity in CRC might lead to a poorer prognosis.
CONCLUSION: The autophagy-related features obtained in this study were able to 
divide the CRC patients into low- and high-risk groups, which should be 
contribute to the decision-making of CRC treatment.
