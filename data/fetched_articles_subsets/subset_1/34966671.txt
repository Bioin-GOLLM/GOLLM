Significant advances have been made recently in the development of targeted 
therapy for lung adenocarcinoma. However, platinum-based chemotherapy remains as 
the cornerstone in the treatment of this neoplasm. This is the treatment option 
for adenocarcinomas without EGFR gain-of-function mutations or tumors that have 
developed resistance to targeted therapy. The High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) 
is a multifunctional protein involved in intrinsic resistance to cisplatin. 
HMGB1 is released when cytotoxic agents, such as cisplatin, induce cell death. 
In the extracellular milieu, HMGB1 acts as adjuvant to induce an antitumor 
immune response. However, the opposite effect favoring tumor progression has 
also been reported. In this study, the effects of cisplatin in lung 
adenocarcinoma cell lines harboring clinically relevant mutations, such as EGFR 
mutations, were studied. Subcellular localization of HMGB1 was detected in the 
cell lines and in viable cells after a single exposure to cisplatin, which are 
designated as cisplatin-persistent cells. The mRNA expression of the receptor 
for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), TLR-2, and TLR-4 receptors was 
measured in parental cell lines and their persistent variants. Finally, changes 
in plasma HMGB1 from a cohort of lung adenocarcinoma patients without EGFR 
mutation and treated with cisplatin-based therapy were analyzed. 
Cisplatin-susceptible lung adenocarcinoma cell lines died by apoptosis or 
necrosis and released HMGB1. In cisplatin-persistent cells, nuclear 
relocalization of HMGB1 and overexpression of HMGB1 and RAGE, but not TLR-2 or 
TLR-4, were observed. In tumor cells, this HMGB1-RAGE interaction may be 
associated with the development of cisplatin resistance. The results indicate a 
direct relationship between the plasma levels of HMGB1 and overall survival. In 
conclusion, HMGB1 may be an effective biomarker associated with increased 
overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients.
