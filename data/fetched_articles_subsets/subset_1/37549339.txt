AIMS: The pathophysiological hallmark of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is the 
deposition of amyloid within the myocardium. Consequently, extracellular volume 
(ECV) of affected patients increases. However, studies on ECV progression over 
time are lacking. We aimed to investigate the progression of ECV and its 
prognostic impact in CA patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations, 
including ECV quantification, were performed in consecutive CA patients. Between 
2012 and 2021, 103 CA patients underwent baseline and follow-up CMR, including 
ECV quantification. Median ECVs at baseline of the total (n = 103), 
transthyretin [(ATTR) n = 80], and [light chain (AL) n = 23] CA cohorts were 
48.0%, 49.0%, and 42.6%, respectively. During a median period of 12 months, ECV 
increased significantly in all cohorts [change (Δ) +3.5% interquartile range 
(IQR): -1.9 to +6.9, P < 0.001; Δ +3.5%, IQR: -2.0 to +6.7, P < 0.001; and Δ 
+3.5%, IQR: -1.6 to +9.1, P = 0.026]. Separate analyses for treatment-naïve (n = 
21) and treated (n = 59) ATTR patients revealed that the median change of ECV 
from baseline to follow-up was significantly higher among untreated patients 
(+5.7% vs. +2.3%, P = 0.004). Survival analyses demonstrated that median change 
of ECV was a predictor of outcome [total: hazard ratio (HR): 1.095, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 1.047-1.0145, P < 0.001; ATTR: HR: 1.073, 95% CI: 
1.015-1.134, P = 0.013; and AL: HR: 1.131, 95% CI: 1.041-1.228, P = 0.003].
CONCLUSION: The present study supports the use of serial ECV quantification in 
CA patients, as change of ECV was a predictor of outcome and could provide 
information in the evaluation of amyloid-specific treatments.
