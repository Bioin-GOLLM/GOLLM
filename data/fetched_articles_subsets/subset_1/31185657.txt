Emerin is a nuclear envelope protein that contributes to genome organization and 
cell mechanics. Through its N-terminal LAP2-emerin-MAN1 (LEM)-domain, emerin 
interacts with the DNA-binding protein barrier-to-autointegration (BAF). Emerin 
also binds to members of the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton 
(LINC) complex. Mutations in the gene encoding emerin are responsible for the 
majority of cases of X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (X-EDMD). Most 
of these mutations lead to an absence of emerin. A few missense and short 
deletion mutations in the disordered region of emerin are also associated with 
X-EDMD. More recently, missense and short deletion mutations P22L, ∆K37 and T43I 
were discovered in emerin LEM-domain, associated with isolated atrial cardiac 
defects (ACD). Here we reveal which defects, at both the molecular and cellular 
levels, are elicited by these LEM-domain mutations. Whereas K37 mutation 
impaired the correct folding of the LEM-domain, P22L and T43I had no impact on 
the 3D structure of emerin. Surprisingly, all three mutants bound to BAF, albeit 
with a weaker affinity in the case of K37. In human myofibroblasts derived from 
a patient's fibroblasts, emerin ∆K37 was correctly localized at the inner 
nuclear membrane, but was present at a significantly lower level, indicating 
that this mutant is abnormally degraded. Moreover, SUN2 was reduced, and these 
cells were defective in producing actin stress fibers when grown on a stiff 
substrate and after cyclic stretches. Altogether, our data suggest that the main 
effect of mutation K37 is to perturb emerin function within the LINC complex in 
response to mechanical stress.
