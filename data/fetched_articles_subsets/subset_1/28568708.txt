Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies and a 
major cause of cancer involved death worldwide. Prognosis remains poor because 
of high recurrence rates and lack of effective relapse prevention strategies. 
Notch pathway plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis, and 
it is associated with the prognosis of cancer. A total of 465 hepatitis B virus 
(HBV)-related HCC patients who underwent surgery were enrolled. Single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of Notch pathway receptors were genotyped using 
Sanger DNA sequencing. Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards 
regression model were adopted to analyze the association of polymorphisms and 
mRNA expression with clinical and pathological features, respectively. Four SNPs 
(rs1043996 in Notch3 and rs422951, rs520692, rs3830041 in Notch4) were 
significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (P = 0.023, P = 0.042, 
P = 0.028, and P = 0.001 respectively). Patients carrying the AA genotype in 
rs1043996 and TT/TC genotypes in rs422951 and rs520692 significantly decreased 
risks of death, compared to those carrying the AG/GG genotype in rs1043996 and 
CC genotype in rs422951 and rs520692, respectively. Patients carrying the TT 
genotype in rs3830041 showed poorer OS, compared with those carrying the TC/CC 
genotype. A haplotype block (rs422951 was in strong LD with rs520692, r2 
 = 0.843) was identified in Notch4. Notch3 mRNA expression significantly 
increased in tumor tissue, compared with nontumor normal tissue (P < 0.0001). 
Moreover, higher expression of Notch3 was associated with poorer OS (HR = 2.11, 
95% CI = 1.32-3.37, P = 0.002) and shorter recurrence time of HBV-related HCC 
(HR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.31-2.93, P = 0.001). Our findings collectively indicate 
that Notch receptors variants (rs1043996 in Notch3 and rs422951, rs520692, 
rs3830041 in Notch4) are independent predictive targets for OS in HBV-related 
HCC patients. Notch3 expression is a potential prognostic biomarker of OS and 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) prediction in HBV-related HCC patients following 
surgical treatment.
