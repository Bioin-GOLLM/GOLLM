Many host-parasite interactions are mediated via surface-exposed proteins 
containing bacterial immunoglobulin-like (Big) domains. Here, we utilize the 
spectral properties of a conserved Trp to provide evidence that, along with a 
Phe, these residues are positioned within the hydrophobic core of a subset of 
Big_2 domains. The mutation of the Phe to Ala decreases Big_2 domain stability 
and impairs the ability of LigBCen2 to bind to the host protein, fibronectin.
