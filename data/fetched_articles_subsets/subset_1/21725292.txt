Microtubule nucleation in all eukaryotes involves γ-tubulin small complexes 
(γTuSCs) that comprise two molecules of γ-tubulin bound to γ-tubulin complex 
proteins (GCPs) GCP2 and GCP3. In many eukaryotes, multiple γTuSCs associate 
with GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6 into large γ-tubulin ring complexes (γTuRCs). Recent 
cryo-EM studies indicate that a scaffold similar to γTuRCs is formed by lateral 
association of γTuSCs, with the C-terminal regions of GCP2 and GCP3 binding 
γ-tubulin molecules. However, the exact role of GCPs in microtubule nucleation 
remains unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of human GCP4 and show 
that its C-terminal domain binds directly to γ-tubulin. The human GCP4 structure 
is the prototype for all GCPs, as it can be precisely positioned within the 
γTuSC envelope, revealing the nature of protein-protein interactions and 
conformational changes regulating nucleation activity.
