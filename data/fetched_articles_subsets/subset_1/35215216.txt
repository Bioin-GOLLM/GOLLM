African swine fever virus (ASFV) remains a threat to global pig populations. 
Infections with ASFV lead to a hemorrhagic disease with up to 100% lethality in 
Eurasian domestic and wild pigs. Although myeloid cells are the main target 
cells for ASFV, T cell responses are impacted by the infection as well. The 
complex responses remain not well understood, and, consequently, there is no 
commercially available vaccine. Here, we review the current knowledge about the 
induction of antiviral T cell responses by cells of the myeloid lineage, as well 
as T cell responses in infected animals, recent efforts in vaccine research, and 
T cell epitopes present in ASFV.
