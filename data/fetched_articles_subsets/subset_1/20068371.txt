PURPOSE: We present the rare case of a young male patient with asymmetric ocular 
findings: pigmentary ocular hypertension associated with nonischemic central 
retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in the right eye and pigmentary glaucoma (PG) with 
progressive glaucomatous optic damage in the left eye.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 31-year-old man showed nonischemic CRVO in the right eye 
and the clinical triad of pigment dispersion syndrome in both eyes, however more 
marked in the left eye. Best-corrected visual acuity was logMAR 0.3 in the right 
eye and 1.0 in the left eye at presentation. The single risk for developing PG 
and CRVO was hyperhomocysteinemia. The patient was a carrier of the 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677 homozygous mutation.
RESULTS: At 18 months of follow-up, visual acuity remained stable, intraocular 
pressure was in the normal range, but retinal tomography indicated an increase 
in glaucomatous optic damage to the nerve fiber layer in almost the complete 
temporal-inferior sector of the left eye, but without visual field defects in 
the left eye. Retinal tomography and automated perimetry were normal in the 
right eye. The patient received topical antiglaucomatous therapy.
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of plasma homocysteine, even mildly elevated ones, 
could be associated with nonischemic CRVO and PG, especially when related to 
genetic risk factors or C677T mutation.
