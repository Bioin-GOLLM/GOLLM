BACKGROUND: Diastolic dysfunction refers to an impaired relaxation and an 
abnormality in a heart's filling during diastole while left ventricular systolic 
function is preserved. Diastolic dysfunction is commonly observed in patients 
with primary hypertension, diabetes and cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathy. We have generated a restrictive 
cardiomyopathy (RCM) mouse model with troponin mutations in the heart to mimic 
the human RCM patients carrying the same mutations.
RESULTS: In the present study, we have investigated the ventricular muscle 
internal dynamics and pressure developed during systole and diastole by 
inserting a micro-catheter into the left ventricle of the RCM mice with or 
without treatment of desensitizer green tea extracts catechins. Our results 
demonstrate that green tea catechin is able to correct diastolic dysfunction in 
RCM mainly by improving ventricular compliance and reducing the internal muscle 
rigidity caused by myofibril hypersensitivity to Ca(2+).
CONCLUSION: Green tea extract catechin is effective in correcting diastolic 
dysfunction and improving ventricular muscle intrinsic compliance in RCM caused 
by troponin mutations.
