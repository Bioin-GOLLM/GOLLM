Endoglin (ENG) regulates signaling by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a 
genetic modifier of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease severity. We hypothesized 
that ENG mediates TGF-β pathobiology in CF airway epithelia. Comparing CF and 
non-CF human lungs, we measured ENG by qPCR, immunoblotting and ELISA. In human 
bronchial epithelial cell lines (16HBE), we used CFTR siRNA knockdown and 
functional inhibition (CFTRINH -172) to connect loss of CFTR to ENG synthesis. 
Plasmid overexpression of ENG assessed the direct effect of ENG on TGF-β 
transcription and signal amplification in 16HBE cells. We found ENG protein to 
be increased more than fivefold both in human CF bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) 
and human CF lung homogenates. ENG transcripts were increased threefold in CF, 
with a twofold increase in TGF-β signaling. CFTR knockdown in 16HBE cells 
tripled ENG transcription and doubled protein levels with corresponding 
increases in TGF-β signaling. Plasmid overexpression of ENG alone nearly doubled 
TGF-β1 mRNA and increased TGF-β signaling in 16HBE cells. These experiments 
identify that loss of CFTR function increases ENG expression in CF epithelia and 
amplifies TGF-β signaling. Targeting ENG may offer a novel therapeutic 
opportunity to address TGF-β associated pathobiology in CF.
