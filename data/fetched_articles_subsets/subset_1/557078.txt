Immunoproteins in human brain tumor cyst fluids.

Murray KJ, Ausman JI, Chou SN, Douglas SD.

Quantitation of the concentration of immunoproteins in serum, and cystic fluids 
from six patients (three with cerebral astrocytoma and three with cerebellar 
hemangioblastoma) has been determined. The values for total protein, albumin, 
immunoproteins IgG, IgA, and IgM, and C3C (complement) in cyst fluid more 
closely correspond to serum than to cerebrospinal fluid values. Values for cyst 
fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum were determined using albumin ratios in 
order to compare relative differences between fluids from these three 
compartments. Our data suggests that: 1) the major protein content of brain 
tumor cyst fluid is consequential to a transudative process from serum, and 2) 
that immunoglobulins IgG and IgA are present in higher concentrations in human 
brain tumor cyst fluids in comparison to IgM concentrations. These studies 
further question the concept of the brain as an "immunological privileged site", 
and may be of direct relevance to the investigation of the use of 
immunotherapeutic modalities as an adjunct after surgical tumor removal.
