The mouse kreisler (kr) mutation causes segmentation abnormalities in the caudal 
hindbrain and defective inner ear development. Based on an inversion discovered 
in the original kr allele, we selected a candidate cDNA highly expressed in the 
developing caudal hindbrain. This cDNA encodes a basic domain-leucine zipper 
(bZIP) transcription factor and was confirmed to represent the kr gene by 
analysis of a second kr allele, generated by chemical mutagenesis, in which a 
serine is substituted for an asparagine residue conserved in the DNA-binding 
domain of all known bZIP family members. The identity, expression, and mutant 
phenotype of kr indicate an early role in axial patterning and provide insights 
into the molecular and embryologic mechanisms that govern hindbrain and otic 
development.
