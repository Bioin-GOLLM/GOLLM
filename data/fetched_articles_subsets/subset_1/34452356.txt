Here, we report on the increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A.27 in 
Germany during the first months of 2021. Genomic surveillance identified 710 
A.27 genomes in Germany as of 2 May 2021, with a vast majority identified in 
laboratories from a single German state (Baden-Wuerttemberg, n = 572; 80.5%). 
Baden-Wuerttemberg is located near the border with France, from where most A.27 
sequences were entered into public databases until May 2021. The first 
appearance of this lineage based on sequencing in a laboratory in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg can be dated to early January '21. From then on, the relative 
abundance of A.27 increased until the end of February but has since 
declined-meanwhile, the abundance of B.1.1.7 increased in the region. The A.27 
lineage shows a mutational pattern typical of VOIs/VOCs, including an 
accumulation of amino acid substitutions in the Spike glycoprotein. Among those, 
L18F, L452R and N501Y are located in the epitope regions of the N-terminal- 
(NTD) or receptor binding domain (RBD) and have been suggested to result in 
immune escape and higher transmissibility. In addition, A.27 does not show the 
D614G mutation typical for all VOIs/VOCs from the B lineage. Overall, A.27 
should continue to be monitored nationally and internationally, even though the 
observed trend in Germany was initially displaced by B.1.1.7 (Alpha), while now 
B.1.617.2 (Delta) is on the rise.
