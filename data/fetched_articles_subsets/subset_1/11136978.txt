Ras activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is important for survival of 
transformed cells. We find that PI3Kgamma is strongly and directly activated by 
H-Ras G12V in vivo or by GTPgammaS-loaded H-Ras in vitro. We have determined a 
crystal structure of a PI3Kgamma/Ras.GMPPNP complex. A critical loop in the Ras 
binding domain positions Ras so that it uses its switch I and switch II regions 
to bind PI3Kgamma. Mutagenesis shows that interactions with both regions are 
essential for binding PI3Kgamma. Ras also forms a direct contact with the 
PI3Kgamma catalytic domain. These unique Ras/PI3Kgamma interactions are likely 
to be shared by PI3Kalpha. The complex with Ras shows a change in the PI3K 
conformation that may represent an allosteric component of Ras activation.
