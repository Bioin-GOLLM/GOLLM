Peripheral and intraspinal feedback is required to shape and update the output 
of spinal networks that execute motor behavior. We report that lumbar dI2 spinal 
interneurons in chicks receive synaptic input from afferents and premotor 
neurons. These interneurons innervate contralateral premotor networks in the 
lumbar and brachial spinal cord, and their ascending projections innervate the 
cerebellum. These findings suggest that dI2 neurons function as interneurons in 
local lumbar circuits, are involved in lumbo-brachial coupling, and that part of 
them deliver peripheral and intraspinal feedback to the cerebellum. Silencing of 
dI2 neurons leads to destabilized stepping in posthatching day 8 hatchlings, 
with occasional collapses, variable step profiles, and a wide-base walking gait, 
suggesting that dI2 neurons may contribute to the stabilization of the bipedal 
gait.
