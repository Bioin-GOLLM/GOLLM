Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognition of cytosolic DNA is critical for the 
immune response to cancer and pathogen infection. Here, we discover that 
cGAS-DNA phase separation is required to resist negative regulation and allow 
efficient sensing of immunostimulatory DNA. We map the molecular determinants of 
cGAS condensate formation and demonstrate that phase separation functions to 
limit activity of the cytosolic exonuclease TREX1. Mechanistically, phase 
separation forms a selective environment that suppresses TREX1 catalytic 
function and restricts DNA degradation to an outer shell at the droplet 
periphery. We identify a TREX1 mutation associated with the severe autoimmune 
disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome that increases penetration of TREX1 into the 
repressive droplet interior and specifically impairs degradation of 
phase-separated DNA. Our results define a critical function of cGAS-DNA phase 
separation and reveal a molecular mechanism that balances cytosolic DNA 
degradation and innate immune activation.
