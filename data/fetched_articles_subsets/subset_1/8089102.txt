In plasma the thyroid hormone-binding protein transthyretin (TTR) forms a tight 
complex with the specific retinol carrier retinol-binding protein (RBP). The 
Ile-84-->Ser mutation and several other point mutations in TTR are associated 
with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, which is characterized by 
extracellular depositions of amyloid fibrils mainly consisting of mutated TTRs. 
The interactions with human RBP of recombinant human normal and Ser-84 TTRs were 
investigated by monitoring the fluorescence anisotropy of RBP-bound retinol. A 
nearly negligible affinity of the recombinant Ser-84 TTR for RBP was found. This 
result indicates the participation of a region on the outer surface of TTR that 
comprises Ile-84 in the recognition of RBP. In preliminary studies the Ser-84 
TTR was the only one among several amyloidogenic variant TTRs to display 
negligible interaction with RBP. Therefore, in general a substantially altered 
binding of TTR to RBP is not associated with familial amyloidotic 
polyneuropathy. Instead, the altered binding of Ser-84 TTR to RBP appears to be 
responsible for an abnormal plasma transport of RBP. The recombinant normal TTR 
exhibits binding properties, in its interaction with human RBP, approximately 
similar to those of TTR purified from human plasma. Two independent and 
equivalent RBP binding sites on recombinant normal TTR are characterized by a 
dissociation constant of about 0.4 microM.
