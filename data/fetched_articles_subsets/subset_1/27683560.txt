Secondary shifts develop in post-translational phosphorylation of sarcomeric 
proteins in multiple animal models of inherited cardiomyopathy. These signaling 
alterations together with the primary mutation are predicted to contribute to 
the overall cardiac phenotype. As a result, identification and integration of 
post-translational myofilament signaling responses are identified as priorities 
for gaining insights into sarcomeric cardiomyopathies. However, significant 
questions remain about the nature and contribution of post-translational 
phosphorylation to structural remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in animal 
models and human patients. This perspective essay discusses specific goals for 
filling critical gaps about post-translational signaling in response to these 
inherited mutations, especially within sarcomeric proteins. The discussion 
focuses primarily on pre-clinical analysis of animal models and defines 
challenges and future directions in this field.
