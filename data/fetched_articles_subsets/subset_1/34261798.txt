Lung and bladder cancers are mostly incurable because of the early development 
of drug resistance and metastatic dissemination. Hence, improved therapies that 
tackle these two processes are urgently needed to improve clinical outcome. We 
have identified RSK4 as a promoter of drug resistance and metastasis in lung and 
bladder cancer cells. Silencing this kinase, through either RNA interference or 
CRISPR, sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapy and hindered metastasis in vitro 
and in vivo in a tail vein injection model. Drug screening revealed several 
floxacin antibiotics as potent RSK4 activation inhibitors, and trovafloxacin 
reproduced all effects of RSK4 silencing in vitro and in/ex vivo using lung 
cancer xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models and bladder tumor 
explants. Through x-ray structure determination and Markov transient and 
Deuterium exchange analyses, we identified the allosteric binding site and 
revealed how this compound blocks RSK4 kinase activation through binding to an 
allosteric site and mimicking a kinase autoinhibitory mechanism involving the 
RSK4's hydrophobic motif. Last, we show that patients undergoing chemotherapy 
and adhering to prophylactic levofloxacin in the large placebo-controlled 
randomized phase 3 SIGNIFICANT trial had significantly increased (P = 0.048) 
long-term overall survival times. Hence, we suggest that RSK4 inhibition may 
represent an effective therapeutic strategy for treating lung and bladder 
cancer.
