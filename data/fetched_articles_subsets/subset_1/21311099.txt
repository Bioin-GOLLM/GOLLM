We have previously shown that the differential susceptibility of A/J 
(susceptible) and C57BL/6J (B6, resistant) mouse strains to azoxymethane 
(AOM)-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) is controlled by the chromosome 3 locus, 
Ccs3. We report that A/J and B6 mice also show differential susceptibility to 
colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CA-CRC) induced by combined administration 
of AOM and dextran sulfate. This differential susceptibility is not controlled 
by Ccs3, but is under distinct genetic control. Linkage analyses in (A/J x B6)F2 
mice detected a major CA-CRC susceptibility locus on chromosome 9 (Ccs4) which 
controls tumor multiplicity and tumor surface area. Susceptibility alleles at 
Ccs4 are inherited in a recessive fashion, with A/J alleles being associated 
with susceptibility. We also detected a second locus on chromosome 14 that acts 
in an additive fashion with Ccs4. Strikingly, F2 mice homozygous for A/J alleles 
at both loci (Ccs4 and chromosome 14) are as susceptible to CA-CRC as the A/J 
controls while mice homozygous for B6 alleles are as resistant as the B6 
controls, thus supporting the role of two interacting loci in this CA-CRC model. 
This indicates that susceptibility to chemically-induced CRC and susceptibility 
to CA-CRC are under distinct genetic control in mice, and probably involve 
distinct cellular pathways.
