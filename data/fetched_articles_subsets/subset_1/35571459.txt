BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and represents an important global public health 
issue. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and INDELs are common genetic variations 
that can be located in genes associated with immune response and, therefore, 
they may have direct implications over the phenotype of susceptibility to 
infections like tuberculosis. This study aimed to investigate the association 
between the 17 genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to tuberculosis in a 
Brazilian population.
METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 283 individuals with active 
tuberculosis and 145 health care workers. Four INDELs and 13 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms and were genotyped using Multiplex PCR method and TaqMan SNP 
Genotyping Assays. Group comparisons for categorical variables were performed 
using the chi-squared test, whilst the t-Student test was used to analyze the 
continuous variables. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to 
estimate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Deviation from 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed using chi-squared tests with Bonferroni 
correction. The results were analyzed comparing the genotypic distributions 
adopting the dominant model and the estimated values ​​of p corrected for 
multiple tests through FDR (False Discovery Rate) test.
RESULTS: The HWE test confirmed that the genotypic frequencies for polymorphisms 
were balanced. The frequency of Del allele was 73 and 75%, in cases and controls 
respectively. Frequency of Del allele was significantly higher in the control 
group than TB group. The homozygous Del/Del genotype was present in 51.6% of 
cases and 58.6% of controls. The rare Ins/Ins genotype was present in only 7.6% 
of controls and 6% of cases. The ACE Del/Del genotype was significantly higher 
in the cases than in controls revealing significant protection for TB in the 
domain model (OR = 0.465; p < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: The Del/Del genotype of the rs4646994 in ACE gene was associated 
with susceptibility to tuberculosis. The identification of genetic variants 
responsible for susceptibility to tuberculosis will allow the development of new 
diagnostic tools for tuberculosis infection. These studies will help improve 
control and the future eradication of this disease.
