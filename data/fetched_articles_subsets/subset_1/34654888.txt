Members of the cytochrome p450 (CYP) enzyme family are abundantly expressed in 
insect olfactory tissues, where they are thought to act as Odorant Degrading 
Enzymes (ODEs). However, their contribution to olfactory signaling in vivo is 
poorly understood. This is due in part to the challenge of identifying which of 
the dozens of antennal-expressed CYPs might inactivate a given odorant. Here, we 
tested a high-throughput deorphanization strategy in Drosophila to identify CYPs 
that are transcriptionally induced by exposure to odorants. We discovered three 
CYPs selectively upregulated by geranyl acetate using transcriptional profiling. 
Although these CYPs are broadly expressed in the antenna in non-neuronal cells, 
electrophysiological recordings from CYP mutants did not reveal any changes in 
olfactory neuron responses to this odorant. Neurons were desensitized by 
pre-exposing flies to the odorant, but this effect was similar in CYP mutants. 
Together, our data suggest that the induction of a CYP gene by an odorant does 
not necessarily indicate a role for that CYP in neuronal responses to that 
odorant. We go on to show that some CYPs have highly restricted expression 
patterns in the antenna, and suggest that such CYPs may be useful candidates for 
further studies on olfactory CYP function.
