As an in-depth understanding of immunotherapy continues to grow, current 
anticancer therapy research is increasingly focused on the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the regulation 
of genetic information and expression and mediate interactions between tumor 
cells and components in the TME, such as tumor-associated macrophages 
(macrophages). Macrophages are abundant in the TME, and their different 
polarization directions can promote or inhibit tumor growth and progression. By 
regulating biological behaviors, such as macrophage recruitment, infiltration, 
and polarization, miRNAs can affect various molecular pathways to regulate tumor 
progression and treatment response. In this review, we discuss in detail the 
effects of macrophages on tumors and the multifaceted effects of miRNAs on 
macrophages. We also discuss the potential clinical applications and prospects 
of targeted therapy based on miRNAs, novel clinical biomarkers, and drug 
delivery systems.
