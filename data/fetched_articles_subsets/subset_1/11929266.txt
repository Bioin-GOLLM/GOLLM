Ab initio methods were used to shed light on fundamental aspects of the 
enzymatic mechanism of guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis in the Cdc42/Cdc42GAP 
complex. The calculations focused on the nucleophilic addition of the catalytic 
water molecule to the gamma-phosphate phosphorus atom. A large model system was 
required to correctly reproduce the electrostatic properties on the active site. 
The model turned out to reproduce most of the electrostatic field of the 
biological complex at the reactants. Our calculations established the H-bond 
pattern of the catalytic water (WAT), which turned out to interact with Q61 and 
T35, in the most stable conformation. This ruled out the possibility that the 
catalytic water transferred its proton directly to the gamma-phosphate. 
Furthermore, the calculations suggested that the electronic structure of WAT was 
very different from that in the bulk. Finally, this study showed that during the 
reaction, WAT transferred a proton to Gln61, consistent with the available X-ray 
data on a transition-state analogue/enzyme complex(19) and with the decrease of 
activity in the Q61E mutant.
