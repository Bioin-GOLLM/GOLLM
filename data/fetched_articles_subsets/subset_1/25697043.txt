Dystonia is a movement disorder of both genetic and non-genetic causes, which 
typically results in twisted posturing due to abnormal muscle contraction. 
Evidence from dystonia patients and animal models of dystonia indicate a crucial 
role for the striatal cholinergic system in the pathophysiology of dystonia. In 
this review, we focus on striatal circuitry and the centrality of the 
acetylcholine system in the function of the basal ganglia in the control of 
voluntary movement and ultimately clinical manifestation of movement disorders. 
We consider the impact of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) on 
dopamine-acetylcholine interactions and examine new evidence for impairment of 
ChIs in dysfunction of the motor systems producing dystonic movements, 
particularly in animal models. We have observed paradoxical excitation of ChIs 
in the presence of dopamine D2 receptor agonists and impairment of striatal 
synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of DYT1 dystonia, which are improved by 
administration of recently developed M1 receptor antagonists. These findings 
have been confirmed across multiple animal models of DYT1 dystonia and may 
represent a common endophenotype by which to investigate dystonia induced by 
other types of genetic and non-genetic causes and to investigate the potential 
effectiveness of pharmacotherapeutics and other strategies to improve dystonia.
