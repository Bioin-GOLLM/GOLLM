Aberrant de novo lipogenesis (DNL) results in excessive hepatic lipid 
accumulation and liver steatosis, the causative factors of many liver diseases, 
such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism of 
DNL dysregulation remains largely unknown. Ubiquitination of proteins in 
hepatocytes has been shown to be widely involved in lipid metabolism of liver. 
Here, we revealed that Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinase 
(DUB), played key roles in DNL through regulation of zinc finger protein 638 
(ZNF638) in hepatocytes. USP7 has been shown not only to interact with and 
deubiquitylate ZNF638, but also to facilitate the transcription of ZNF638 via 
the stabilization of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). USP7/ZNF638 
axis selectively increased the cleavage of sterol regulatory element binding 
protein (SREBP1C) through AKT/mTORC1/S6K signaling, and formed 
USP7/ZNF638/SREBP1C nuclear complex to regulate lipogenesis-associated enzymes, 
including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACACA), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and 
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In the mice liver steatosis model induced by 
fructose, USP7 or ZNF638 abrogation significantly ameliorated disease 
progression. Furthermore, USP7/ZNF638 axis participated in the progression of 
lipogenesis-associated HCC. Our results have uncovered a novel mechanism of 
hepatic DNL, which might be beneficial to the development of new therapeutic 
targets for hepatic lipogenesis-associated diseases.
