Oxidative stress hinders tissue regeneration in cell therapy by inducing 
apoptosis and dysfunction in transplanted cells. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) 
reinforces cellular antioxidant capabilities by increasing a major cellular 
endogenous antioxidant molecule, glutathione, and promotes osteogenic 
differentiation. This study investigates the effects of pretreatment of 
osteoblast-like cells with NAC on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and 
dysfunction and bone regeneration in local transplants. Rat femur bone 
marrow-derived osteoblast-like cells preincubated for 3 h with and without 5 mM 
NAC were cultured in a NAC-free osteogenic differentiation medium with 
continuous exposure to 50 Î¼M hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative stress. NAC 
preincubation prevented disruption of intracellular redox balance and alleviated 
apoptosis and negative impact on osteogenic differentiation, even under 
oxidative stress. Autologous osteoblast-like cells with and without NAC 
pretreatment in a collagen sponge vehicle were implanted in critical-size 
defects in rat femurs. In the third week, NAC-pretreated cells yielded complete 
defect closure with significantly matured lamellar bone tissue in contrast with 
poor bone healing by cells without pretreatment. Cell-tracking analysis 
demonstrated direct bone deposition by transplanted cells pretreated with NAC. 
Pretreatment of osteoblast-like cells with NAC enhances bone regeneration in 
local transplantation by preventing oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and 
dysfunction at the transplanted site.
