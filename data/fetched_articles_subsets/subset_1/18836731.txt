BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Integrins such as alpha(2)beta(1), alpha(IIb)beta(3), and 
alpha(v)beta(3) have been suggested as key players for cancer development and 
progression. Several polymorphisms affecting these molecules, two in integrin 
alpha(2) (ITGA2 807C>T and 1648G>A) and one in beta(3) (ITGB3 176T>C), influence 
their levels, structure, and possibly their function. To analyze the role of 
ITGA2 and ITGB3 polymorphisms for colorectal cancer risk and clinical 
presentation, we performed a case-control study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred thirty-three colorectal cancer patients and 
433 healthy sex- and age-matched control subjects were investigated. ITGA2 and 
ITGB3 polymorphisms were determined by 5'-nuclease assays.
RESULTS/FINDINGS: The ITGA2 807C>T polymorphism was associated with reduced 
colorectal cancer risk. In a codominant model, the odds ratio for each 
additional 807-T allele for colorectal cancer was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 
0.64-0.94; p = 0.011). The ITGA2 1648G> and the ITGB3 176T>C polymorphism were 
not associated with colorectal cancer. None of the three polymorphisms 
investigated was associated with tumor size, histological grade, presence of 
primary lymph node metastases, tumor stage, or age at diagnosis.
INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: We conclude that the ITGA2 807C>T polymorphism may be 
associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk.
