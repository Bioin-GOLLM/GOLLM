BACKGROUND: Bioconjugates of a polyamidoamine (PAMAM) G3 dendrimer and an 
aldehyde were synthesized as carriers for vitamins A and B₆, and the 
bioavailability of these vitamins for skin nutrition was investigated.
METHODS: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet-visible methods were 
used to characterize the structure of the bioconjugates and for monitoring 
release of pyridoxal (Pyr) and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) from these 
bioconjugates in vitro. A skin model permeation of bioconjugates was also 
studied in a Franz chamber.
RESULTS: A transdermal G3 PAMAM dendrimer was used to synthesize bioconjugates 
with trans-retinal (Ret), pyridoxal (Pyr), or PLP. These nanomolecules, 
containing up to four covalently linked Ret, Pyr, or PLP (G3(4Ret), G3(4Pyr), 
and G3(4PLP)), were able to permeate the skin, as demonstrated in vitro using a 
model skin membrane. PLP and Pyr bound to a macromolecular vehicle were active 
cofactors for glutamic pyruvic transaminase, as shown by ¹H NMR spectral 
monitoring of the progress of the L-alanine + α-ketoglutarate → glutamic acid + 
pyruvic acid reaction.
CONCLUSION: PAMAM-PLP, PAMAM-Pyr, and PAMAM-Ret bioconjugates are able to 
permeate the skin. PLP and Pyr are available as cofactors for glutamic pyruvic 
transaminase.
