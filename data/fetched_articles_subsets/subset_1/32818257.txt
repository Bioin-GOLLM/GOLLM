CONTEXT: NKX2-2 is a crucial transcription factor that enables specific β-cell 
gene expression. Nkx2-2(-/-) mice manifest with severe neonatal diabetes and 
changes in β-cell progenitor fate into ghrelin-producing cells. In humans, 
recessive NKX2-2 gene mutations have been recently reported as a novel etiology 
for neonatal diabetes, with only 3 cases known worldwide. This study describes 
the genetic analysis, distinctive clinical features, the therapeutic challenges, 
and the unique pathophysiology causing neonatal diabetes in human NKX2-2 
dysfunction.
CASE DESCRIPTION: An infant with very low birth weight (VLBW) and severe 
neonatal diabetes (NDM) presented with severe obesity and developmental delay 
already at age 1 year. The challenge of achieving glycemic control in a VLBW 
infant was unexpectedly met by a regimen of 3 daily doses of long-acting insulin 
analogues. Sanger sequencing of known NDM genes (such as ABCC8 and EIF2AK3) was 
followed by whole-exome sequencing that revealed homozygosity of a pathogenic 
frameshift variant, c.356delG, p.P119fs64*, in the islet cells transcription 
factor, NKX2-2. To elucidate the cause for the severe obesity, an oral glucose 
tolerance test was conducted at age 3.5 years and revealed undetectable 
C-peptide levels with a paradoxically unexpected 30% increase in ghrelin levels.
CONCLUSION: Recessive NKX2-2 loss of function causes severe NDM associated with 
VLBW, childhood obesity, and developmental delay. The severe obesity phenotype 
is associated with postprandial paradoxical ghrelin secretion, which may be 
related to human β-cell fate change to ghrelin-secreting cells, recapitulating 
the finding in Nkx2-2(-/-) mice islet cells.
