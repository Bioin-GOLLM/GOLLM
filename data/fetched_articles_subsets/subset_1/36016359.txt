The nervous necrosis virus (NNV) mainly attacks the central nervous system of 
fish to cause viral nervous necrosis, which is an acute and serious prevalent 
disease in fish. Among different genotypes of NNV, red-spotted grouper nervous 
necrosis virus (RGNNV) is the most widely reported, with the highest number of 
susceptible species. To better understand the pathogenicity of RGNNV, we first 
developed a reverse genetic system for recombinant RGNNV rescue using B7GG and 
striped snakehead (SSN-1) cells. Furthermore, we constructed attenuated RGNNV 
strains rRGNNV-B2-M1 and rRGNNV-B2-M2 with the loss of B2 protein expression, 
which grew slower and induced less Mx1 expression than that of wild-type RGNNV. 
Moreover, rRGNNV-B2-M1 and rRGNNV-B2-M2 were less virulent than the wild-type 
RGNNV. Our study provides a potential tool for further research on the viral 
protein function, virulence pathogenesis, and vaccine development of RGNNV, 
which is also a template for the rescue of other fish viruses.
