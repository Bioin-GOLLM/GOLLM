Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arising in preexisting myeloproliferative 
neoplasms (MPN) is rare with historical cases unable to differentiate between 
concomitant malignancies or leukemic transformation. Here, we report a case of 
patient with Philadelphia positive B lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) who 
developed from MPL-mutated essential thrombocythemia (ET) 13Â years after initial 
presentation. Molecular studies showed the discrepancy between the high 
percentage of lymphocyte blasts (91%) and the low MPL p.(W515L) variant allele 
frequency (2.59%) at diagnosis in the bone marrow, indicating that the Ph+ALL 
clone did not originate from the ET clone carrying the MPL p.(W515L) variant. 
After the treatment of a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor flumatinib and 
prednisolone, cytogenetic and molecular remission had been achieved rapidly and 
followed by the recovery of original ET manifestation. Although relapsed 
eventually, this is still a very rare case of simultaneous presence of two 
cytogenetics abnormalities and evolution of MPL p.(W515L) variant ET to Ph+ALL 
and may provide evidence to illustrate the clonal relationship of MPN and 
post-MPN ALL.
