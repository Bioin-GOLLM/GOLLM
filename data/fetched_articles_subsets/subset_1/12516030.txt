Helicobacter pylori is considered the most prevalent infectious agent among 
humans, and it causes gastric inflammation, gastroduodenal ulcers, and a risk of 
gastric cancer. We performed a genomewide linkage analysis among Senegalese 
siblings phenotyped for H. pylori-reactive serum immunoglobulin G. A multipoint 
LOD score of 3.1 was obtained at IFNGR1, the gene that encodes chain 1 of the 
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) receptor. Sequencing of IFNGR1 revealed -56C-->T, 
H318P, and L450P variants, which were found to be associated with high antibody 
concentrations. The inclusion of these in the linkage analysis raised the LOD 
score to 4.2. The variants were more prevalent in Africans than in whites. Our 
findings indicate that IFN-gamma signaling plays an essential role in human H. 
pylori infection, and they contribute to an explanation of the observations of 
high prevalences and relatively low pathogenicity of H. pylori in Africa. 
Moreover, they provide further support for the value of genomewide linkage 
studies in the analysis of susceptibility to infection and other complex genetic 
traits.
