The number of individual cases of psychiatric disorders that can be ascribed to 
identified, rare, single mutations is increasing with great rapidity. Such 
mutations can be recapitulated in mice to generate animal models with direct 
etiological validity. Defining the underlying pathogenic mechanisms will require 
an experimental and theoretical framework to make the links from mutation to 
altered behavior in an animal or psychopathology in a human. Here, we discuss 
key elements of such a framework, including cell type-based phenotyping, 
developmental trajectories, linking circuit properties at micro and macro scales 
and definition of neurobiological phenotypes that are directly translatable to 
humans.
