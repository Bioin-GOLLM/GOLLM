This study investigated the potential differences in methylprednisolone 
pharmacodynamics between healthy subjects with different histamine 
N-methyltransferase (HNMT) C314T genotypes. Six individuals with C/C genotype 
and 4 with C/T genotype were administered a single intravenous dose of 
methylprednisolone 0.6 mg/kg ideal body weight in a randomized 2-period manner. 
Methylprednisolone plasma concentrations were fitted with a 1-compartment model. 
Cortisol and whole blood histamine suppression were assessed by indirect 
response models, with circadian baseline cortisol analyzed by Fourier analysis. 
The area between the baseline and effect curve and the area under the effect 
versus time curve suppression ratio were used to characterize plasma histamine 
suppression. Methylprednisolone pharmacokinetics and plasma and whole blood 
histamine suppression were similar between the 2 genotype groups. Median nadir 
of cortisol and the 50% inhibitory concentration for cortisol were significantly 
higher in subjects with C/T genotype than those with C/C genotype (P=.031 and 
.033, respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Subjects who are heterozygous for 
the T314 variant allele thus appeared less sensitive to the suppressive effects 
of methylprednisolone on cortisol secretion.
