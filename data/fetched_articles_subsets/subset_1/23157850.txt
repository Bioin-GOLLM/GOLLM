BACKGROUND: The presence of the Y-chromosome or Y chromosome-derived material is 
seen in 4-60% of Turner syndrome patients (Chromosomal Disorders of Sex 
Development (DSD)). DSD patients with specific Y-chromosomal material in their 
karyotype, the GonadoBlastoma on the Y-chromosome (GBY) region, have an 
increased risk of developing type II germ cell tumors/cancer (GCC), most likely 
related to TSPY. The Sex determining Region on the Y gene (SRY) is located on 
the short arm of the Y-chromosome and is the crucial switch that initiates 
testis determination and subsequent male development. Mutations in this gene are 
responsible for sex reversal in approximately 10-15% of 46,XY pure gonadal 
dysgenesis (46,XY DSD) cases. The majority of the mutations described are 
located in the central HMG domain, which is involved in the binding and bending 
of the DNA and harbors two nuclear localization signals. SRY mutations have also 
been found in a small number of patients with a 45,X/46,XY karyotype and might 
play a role in the maldevelopment of the gonads.
METHODS: To thoroughly investigate the presence of possible SRY gene mutations 
in mosaic DSD patients, we performed next generation (deep) sequencing on the 
genomic DNA of fourteen independent patients (twelve 45,X/46,XY, one 
45,X/46,XX/46,XY, and one 46,XX/46,XY).
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that aberrations in SRY are 
rare in mosaic DSD patients and therefore do not play a significant role in the 
etiology of the disease.
