OBJECTIVE: To estimate the heritability of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and 
coronary flow reserve (CFR) measured with positron emission tomography (PET).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional twin study.
SETTING: General clinical research centre of a university hospital at Atlanta, 
USA.
PATIENTS: A sample of 180 middle-aged (mean±SD 55±2.9 years) male twins, 
including 107 monozygotic and 73 dizygotic twins.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All twins underwent imaging of MBF with PET (13)NH(3) at 
rest and after adenosine stress during a single imaging session. Structural 
equation modelling was used to estimate the heritability of MBF at rest and 
during adenosine stress, as well as of CFR.
RESULTS: The basal MBF (mean±SD) was 0.69±0.20 ml/min/g, and the MBF during 
adenosine stress was 1.70±0.49 ml/min/g; the CFR was 2.62±0.99. There was 
substantial heritability for MBF both at rest (0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.64) and 
during adenosine stress (0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.68), as well as CFR (0.48, 95% 
CI 0.26 to 0.65).
CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, a substantial genetic contribution to the 
interindividual variation in MBF and CFR measured with PET in middle-aged men 
has been demonstrated. The data suggest that a fruitful direction for future 
work would be the identification of genetic variants for early atherosclerotic 
stages assessed by PET imaging.
