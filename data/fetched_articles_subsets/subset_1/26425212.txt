The quantitative analysis of reaction products showed that the reaction of 
6(A),6(D)-di-O-trityl-α-cyclodextrin (CD), AD-isomer, with trityl chloride in 
pyridine at 55 °C gave 6(A),6(B),6(E)-tri-O-trityl-α-CD, the amount of which was 
only 25% of that of simultaneously formed 6(A),6(B),6(D)-tri-O-trityl-α-CD. This 
indicates that the bulky trityl groups of glucopyranose-A and -D (Glu-A and -D, 
respectively) in the AD-isomer mainly retard the additional tritylation of the 
C(6)-OH of the adjacent glucopyranoses in a counter-clockwise direction (Glu-F 
and -C, respectively). (1)H NMR spectra of the AD-isomer showed that the O(6)-H 
and C(6)-H signals of Glu-C and -F are shifted upfield due to the ring current 
of the trityl groups. Thus, it is concluded that the bulky trityl groups on 
Glu-A and Glu-D are oriented to Glu-F and Glu-C, respectively, and sterically 
retard additional tritylation on Glu-F and Glu-C. Similar steric hindrance was 
also observed in the additional tritylations of mono-6-O-trityl-α-CD, 
6(A),6(B)-di- and 6(A),6(C)-di-O-trityl-α-CD's.
