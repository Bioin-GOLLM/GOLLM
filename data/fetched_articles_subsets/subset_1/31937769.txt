Copy number variants (CNVs) are suggested to have a widespread impact on the 
human genome and phenotypes. To understand the role of CNVs across human 
diseases, we examine the CNV genomic landscape of 100,028 unrelated individuals 
of European ancestry, using SNP and CGH array datasets. We observe an average 
CNV burden of ~650 kb, identifying a total of 11,314 deletion, 5625 duplication, 
and 2746 homozygous deletion CNV regions (CNVRs). In all, 13.7% are unreported, 
58.6% overlap with at least one gene, and 32.8% interrupt coding exons. These 
CNVRs are significantly more likely to overlap OMIM genes (2.94-fold), GWAS loci 
(1.52-fold), and non-coding RNAs (1.44-fold), compared with random distribution 
(P < 1 × 10-3). We uncover CNV associations with four major disease categories, 
including autoimmune, cardio-metabolic, oncologic, and neurological/psychiatric 
diseases, and identify several drug-repurposing opportunities. Our results 
demonstrate robust frequency definition for large-scale rare variant association 
studies, identify CNVs associated with major disease categories, and illustrate 
the pleiotropic impact of CNVs in human disease.
