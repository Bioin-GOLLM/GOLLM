BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E alleles epsilon2 and epsilon4 have been 
reported as independent risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and as 
predictors for the development of atherosclerosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined by polymerase chain reaction the distribution 
of apolipoprotein E polymorphism in 320 Saudi blood donors (BD), 96 CAD 
patients, and 40 control subjects who had undergone angiography. Compared to 
controls, only epsilon4 was elevated in CAD patients. More than 61% (P <.0001) 
of the patients had angina, and 52.1% (P <.05) were diabetic; both of these 
factors were strongly associated with the presence of allele epsilon2. The 
epsilon2 allele was also associated with hypertension, elevated serum 
triglycerides, and total cholesterol. On the other hand, the allele epsilon4 
appeared to be associated with increased risk of CAD and was also associated 
with hypertension, 3-vessel disease, and restenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Accordingly, epsilon4 may be associated with increased risk of CAD, 
whereas epsilon2 appears to be a predictor of several risk factors for 
atherosclerosis.
