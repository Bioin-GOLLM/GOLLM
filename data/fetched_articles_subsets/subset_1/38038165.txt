Non‑coding RNAs with a length of 22‑24 nt are known as microRNAs (miRNAs or 
miRs), which are critical regulators of protein translation. Over the past 
10 years, the roles of miRNAs have been extensively investigated in several 
human cancer types. There is evidence to indicate that miRNAs regulate gene 
expression by concentrating on a number of substances that have an impact on the 
physiology and development of cancer cells. Thus, miRNAs as regarded as 
effective targets for further studies on the design of novel therapeutic 
strategies. Hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer are 
only a few of the cancers that miR‑124 suppresses. Furthermore, it has been 
shown that miR‑124 is linked to the development and aggressive spread of 
malignancies. The aim of the present review was to clarify and highlight the 
role of miR‑124 in the development and progression of cancer, emphasizing recent 
research illustrating how miR‑124 has been used as a therapeutic agent against 
cancer, as well as the diagnostic potential, regulatory mechanisms and clinical 
application of miR‑124.
