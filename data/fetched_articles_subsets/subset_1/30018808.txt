OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of gout with new-onset atrial fibrillation 
(AF) in the elderly.
METHODS: We used the 5% Medicare data from 2005 to 2012 to assess whether a 
diagnosis of gout was associated with incident AF. We used multivariable Cox 
regression adjusted for demographics, Charlson-Romano comorbidity index, common 
cardiovascular medications, allopurinol and febuxostat use, to calculate hazard 
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Among 1 647 812 eligible people, 9.8% had incident AF. The mean age was 
75 years, 42% were male, 86% were white and the mean Charlson-Romano index score 
was 1.52. We noted 10 604 incident AF cases in people with gout and 150 486 
incident AF cases in people without gout. The crude incidence rates of AF in 
people with and without gout were 43.4 vs 16.3 per 1000 patient-years, 
respectively. After multivariable-adjustment, gout was associated with a higher 
HR of incident AF, 1.92 (95% CI 1.88 to 1.96), with minimal attenuation of HR in 
sensitivity models that replaced the Charlson-Romano index score with a 
categorical variable, HR was 1.91 (95% CI 1.87 to 1.95). In another model that 
adjusted for AF-specific risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia 
and coronary artery disease and individual Charlson-Romano index comorbidities, 
the HR was slightly attenuated at 1.71 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.75). Older age, male 
sex, white race and higher Charlson-Romano index score were each associated with 
higher hazard of incident AF.
CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of gout almost doubled the risk of incident AF in the 
elderly. Future studies should explore the pathogenesis of this association.
