PURPOSE: Currently, the significance of CDKN2A/B mutations in the pathogenesis 
and prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is inconclusive. In this 
study, we analyzed the genetic and clinical features of children with CDKN2A/B 
mutations in ALL. In addition, we evaluated the expression and significance of 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) in serum and explored their role in the susceptibility of childhood ALL.
METHODS: We sequenced CDKN2A/B in the peripheral blood of 120 children with ALL 
and 100 healthy children with physical examination. The levels of CD4+ T, CD8+ 
T, and NK cells were measured by flow cytometry (FCM). Furthermore, the 
expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was detected by ELISA.
RESULTS: We found 32 cases of CDKN2A rs3088440 and 11 of CDKN2B rs2069426 in 120 
ALL children. Children with ALL in the CDKN2A rs3088440 were more likely to have 
hepatosplenomegaly (P = 0.019) and high risk (P = 0.014) than the wild group. In 
contrast, CDKN2B rs2069426 was more likely to develop lymph node metastasis 
(P = 0.017). The level of PD-L1 in the serum of ALL children was significantly 
higher than that of the control group, and there was no significant difference 
in PD-1 (P < 0.001). Additionally, children with CDKN2A rs3088440 had reduced 
CD8+ T cell counts than the wild group (P = 0.039).
CONCLUSION: CDKN2A rs3088440 and CDKN2B rs2069426 may be related to the 
occurrence and development of ALL in Chinese children. Additionally, PD-1/PD-L1 
may be involved in the immune escape process of ALL, which is expected to become 
a new target for the treatment of the disease.
