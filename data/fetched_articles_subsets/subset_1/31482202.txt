RATIONALE: Depression, with variable longitudinal patterns, recurs in one third 
of patients. We lack useful predictors of its course/outcome, and proton 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) of brain metabolites is an underused 
research modality in finding outcome correlates.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if brain metabolite levels/changes in the amygdala 
region observed early in the recovery phase indicate depression recurrence risk 
in patients receiving maintenance therapy.
METHODS: Forty-eight patients on stable-dose antidepressant (AD) maintenance 
therapy were analyzed from recovery onset until (i) recurrence of depression or 
(ii) start of AD discontinuation. Two 1H-MRS scans (6 months apart) were 
performed with a focus on amygdala at the beginning of recovery. 
N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline-containing metabolites (Cho), and Glx 
(glutamine/glutamate and GABA) were evaluated with regard to time without 
recurrence, and risks were assessed by Cox proportional hazard modeling.
RESULTS: Twenty patients had depression recurrence, and 23 patients reached AD 
discontinuation. General linear model repeated measures analysis displayed 
three-way interaction of measurement time, metabolite level, and recurrence on 
maintenance therapy, in a multivariate test, Wilks' lambda = 0.857, 
F(2,40) = 3.348, p = 0.045. Cho levels at the beginning of recovery and 
subsequent changes convey the highest risk for earlier recurrence. Patients 
experiencing higher amygdala Cho after recovery are at a significantly lower 
risk for depression recurrence (hazard ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval 
0.13-0.77).
CONCLUSION: Cho levels/changes in the amygdala early in the recovery phase 
correlate with clinical outcome. In the absence of major NAA fluctuations, 
changes in Cho and Glx may suggest a shift towards reduction in (previously 
increased) glutamatergic neurotransmission. Investigation of a larger sample 
with greater sampling frequency is needed to confirm the possible predictive 
role of metabolite changes in the amygdala region early in the recovery phase.
