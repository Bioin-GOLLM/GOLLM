The coexistence of mutations in the dual oxidase maturation factor 2 (DUOXA2) 
and dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2) genes is rarely identified in congenital 
hypothyroidism (CH). This study reports a boy with CH due to a novel splice-site 
mutation in the DUOXA2 gene and a missense mutation in the DUOX2 gene. A 
four-year-old boy was diagnosed with CH at neonatal screening and was enrolled 
in this study. The DUOXA2, DUOX2, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and thyrotropin 
receptor (TSHR) genes were considered for genetic defects screening. Genomic DNA 
was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and Sanger sequencing was used 
to screen the mutations in the exon fragments. Family members of the patient and 
the controls were also enrolled and evaluated. The boy harbored compound 
heterozygous mutations including a novel splice-site mutation c.554+5C>T in the 
maternal DUOXA2 allele and c.2654G>A (p.R885Q) in the paternal DUOX2 allele. The 
germline mutations from his parents were consistent with an autosomal recessive 
inheritance pattern. No mutations in the TPO and TSHR genes were detected. A 
novel splice-site mutation c.554+5C>T in the DUOXA2 gene and a mutation p.R885Q 
in the DUOX2 gene were identified in a 4-year-old patient with goitrous CH.
