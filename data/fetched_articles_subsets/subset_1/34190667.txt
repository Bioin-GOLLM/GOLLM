CONTEXT: Among the plants in the genus Barringtonia (Lecythidaceae) used as 
traditional medicines to treat arthralgia, chest pain, and haemorrhoids in 
Indonesia, Barringtonia racemosa L. and Barringtonia acutangula (L.) Gaertn. 
have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in systemic inflammatory models.
OBJECTIVE: The anti-inflammatory activity of Barringtonia angusta Kurz has not 
been investigated. We prepared a methanol extract of the leaves and stems of B. 
angusta (Ba-ME) and systemically evaluated its anti-inflammatory effects 
in vitro and in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RAW264.7 cells stimulated with LPS or Pam3CSK4 for 24 h 
were treated with Ba-ME (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 150 µg/mL), and NO production 
and mRNA levels of inflammatory genes were evaluated. Luciferase reporter gene 
assay, western blot analysis, overexpression experiments, and cellular thermal 
shift assay were conducted to explore the mechanism of Ba-ME. In addition, the 
anti-gastritis activity of Ba-ME (50 and 100 mg/kg, administered twice per day 
for two days) was evaluated using an HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis mouse model.
RESULTS: Ba-ME dose-dependently suppressed NO production [IC50 = 123.33 µg/mL 
(LPS) and 46.89 µg/mL (Pam3CSK4)] without affecting cell viability. 
Transcriptional expression of iNOS, IL-1β, COX-2, IL-6, and TNF-α and 
phosphorylation of Src, IκBα, p50/105, and p65 were inhibited by Ba-ME. The 
extract specifically targeted the Src protein by binding to its SH2 domain. 
Moreover, Ba-ME significantly ameliorated inflammatory lesions in the 
HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis model.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The anti-inflammatory activity of Ba-ME is mediated 
by targeting of the Src/NF-κB signalling pathway, and B. angusta has potential 
as an anti-inflammatory drug.
