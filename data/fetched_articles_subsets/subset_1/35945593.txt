BACKGROUND: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a group of 
rare neurogenetic disorders frequently associated with iron accumulation in the 
basal nuclei of the brain characterized by progressive spasticity, dystonia, 
muscle rigidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and retinal degeneration or optic 
nerve atrophy. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is one of 
the most widespread NBIA subtypes. It is caused by mutations in the gene of 
pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) that result in dysfunction in PANK2 enzyme 
activity, with consequent deficiency of coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, as well 
as low levels of essential metabolic intermediates such as 
4'-phosphopantetheine, a necessary cofactor for essential cytosolic and 
mitochondrial proteins.
METHODS: In this manuscript, we examined the therapeutic effectiveness of 
pantothenate, panthetine, antioxidants (vitamin E and omega 3) and mitochondrial 
function boosting supplements (L-carnitine and thiamine) in mutant PANK2 cells 
with residual expression levels.
RESULTS: Commercial supplements, pantothenate, pantethine, vitamin E, omega 3, 
carnitine and thiamine were able to eliminate iron accumulation, increase PANK2, 
mtACP, and NFS1 expression levels and improve pathological alterations in mutant 
cells with residual PANK2 expression levels.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that several commercial compounds are indeed 
able to significantly correct the mutant phenotype in cellular models of PKAN. 
These compounds alone or in combinations are of common use in clinical practice 
and may be useful for the treatment of PKAN patients with residual enzyme 
expression levels.
