Selpercatinib (LOXO292) and pralsetinib (BLU667) are RET protein tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) recently approved for treating RET-altered cancers. However, 
RET mutations that confer selpercatinib/pralsetinib resistance have been 
identified, necessitating development of next-generation RET TKIs. While 
acquired RET G810C/R/S/V mutations were reported in selpercatinib-treated 
patients, it was unclear whether all of these and other potential G810 mutants 
are resistant to selpercatinib and pralsetinib. Here, we profiled selpercatinib 
and pralsetinib on all six possible G810 mutants derived from single nucleotide 
substitution and developed novel alkynyl nicotinamide-based RET TKIs to inhibit 
selpercatinib/pralsetinib-resistant RET G810 mutants. Surprisingly, the G810V 
mutant found in a clinical study was not resistant to selpercatinib or 
pralsetinib. Besides G810C/R/S, G810D also conferred selpercatinib/pralsetinib 
resistance. Alkynyl nicotinamide compounds such as HSN608, HSL476, and HSL468 
have better drug-like properties than alkynyl benzamides. Six of these compounds 
inhibited all six G810 solvent-front mutants and the V804M gatekeeper mutant 
with IC50 < 50 nmol/L in cell culture. Oral administration of HSN608 at a 
well-tolerated dose (30 mg/kg) gave plasma level > 30x the IC50s of inhibiting 
all G810 mutants in cell culture. In cell-derived xenograft tumors driven by 
KIF5B-RET (G810C) that contains the most frequently observed solvent-front 
mutant in selpercatinib-treated patients, HSN608, HSL476, and HSL468 
significantly suppressed and caused regression of the selpercatinib-resistant 
tumors. This study clarifies the sensitivities of different RET solvent-front 
mutants to selpercatinib and pralsetinib and identifies novel alkylnyl 
nicotinamide-based RET TKIs for inhibiting selpercatinib/pralsetinib-resistant 
G810 mutants.
