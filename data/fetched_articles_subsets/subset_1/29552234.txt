INTRODUCTION: The microtubule motor protein kinesin-5 is well known to establish 
the bipolar spindle by outward sliding of antiparallel interpolar microtubules. 
In yeast, kinesin-5 also facilitates chromosome alignment "congression" at the 
spindle equator by preferentially depolymerizing long kinetochore microtubules 
(kMTs). The motor protein kinesin-8 has also been linked to chromosome 
congression. Therefore, we sought to determine whether kinesin-5 or kinesin-8 
facilitates chromosome congression in insect spindles.
METHODS: RNAi of the kinesin-5 Klp61F and kinesin-8 Klp67A were performed 
separately in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells to test for inhibited chromosome 
congression. Klp61F RNAi, Klp67A RNAi, and control metaphase mitotic spindles 
expressing fluorescent tubulin and fluorescent Cid were imaged, and their 
fluorescence distributions were compared.
RESULTS: RNAi of Klp61F with a weak Klp61F knockdown resulted in longer kMTs and 
less congressed kinetochores compared to control over a range of conditions, 
consistent with kinesin-5 length-dependent depolymerase activity. RNAi of the 
kinesin-8 Klp67A revealed that kMTs relative to the spindle lengths were not 
longer compared to control, but rather that the spindles were longer, indicating 
that Klp67A acts preferentially as a length-dependent depolymerase on interpolar 
microtubules without significantly affecting kMT length and chromosome 
congression.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that in addition to establishing the 
bipolar spindle, kinesin-5 regulates kMT length to facilitate chromosome 
congression in insect spindles. It expands on previous yeast studies, and it 
expands the role of kinesin-5 to include kMT assembly regulation in eukaryotic 
mitosis.
