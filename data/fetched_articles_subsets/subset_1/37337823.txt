INTRODUCTION: Handedness is a conspicuous characteristic in human behavior, with 
a worldwide proportion of approximately 90% of people preferring to use the 
right hand for many tasks. In the Korean population, the proportion of 
left-handedness is relatively low at approximately 7%-10%, similar to that in 
other East-Asian cultures in which the use of the left hand for writing and 
other public activities has historically been oppressed.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
between right-handedness and left-handedness, and between right-handedness and 
ambidexterity using logistic regression analyses using a Korean community-based 
cohort. We also performed association analyses with previously reported variants 
and our findings.
RESULTS: A total of 8806 participants were included for analysis, and the 
results identified 28 left-handedness-associated and 15 ambidexterity-associated 
loci; of these, two left-handedness loci (NEIL3 [rs11726465] and SVOPL 
[rs117495448]) and one ambidexterity locus (PDE8B/WDR41 [rs118077080]) showed 
near genome-wide significance. Association analyses with previously reported 
variants replicated ANKS1B (rs7132513) in left-handedness and ANKIB1 (rs2040498) 
in ambidexterity.
CONCLUSION: The variants and positional candidate genes identified and 
replicated in this study were largely associated with brain development, 
cerebral asymmetry, neurological processes, and neuropsychiatric diseases in 
line with previous findings. As the first East-Asian GWAS related to handedness, 
these results may provide an intriguing reference for further human neurologic 
research in the future.
