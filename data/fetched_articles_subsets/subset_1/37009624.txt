Modular Cloning (MoClo) allows the combinatorial assembly of plasmids from 
standardized genetic parts without the need of error-prone PCR reactions. It is 
a very powerful strategy which enables highly flexible expression patterns 
without the need of repetitive cloning procedures. In this study, we describe an 
advanced MoClo toolkit that is designed for the baker's yeast Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae and optimized for the targeting of proteins of interest to specific 
cellular compartments. Comparing different targeting sequences, we developed 
signals to direct proteins with high specificity to the different mitochondrial 
subcompartments, such as the matrix and the intermembrane space (IMS). 
Furthermore, we optimized the subcellular targeting by controlling expression 
levels using a collection of different promoter cassettes; the MoClo strategy 
allows it to generate arrays of expression plasmids in parallel to optimize gene 
expression levels and reliable targeting for each given protein and cellular 
compartment. Thus, the MoClo strategy enables the generation of 
protein-expressing yeast plasmids that accurately target proteins of interest to 
various cellular compartments.
