Gene targeting can be achieved by precise genetic modifications through 
homology-directed repair (HDR) after DNA breaks introduced by genome editing 
tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 system. The most common form of HDR is homologous 
recombination (HR). Binding to the DNA breaks by HR factors is thought to 
compete with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), an alternative DNA repair 
pathway. Here, we knocked out the factors in NHEJ by CRISPR/Cas9 system in 
silkworm cells, so that increased the activities of HR up to 7-fold. Also 
efficient HR-mediated genome editing events occurred between the chromosomal 
BmTUDOR-SN gene and donor DNA sequences with an EGFP gene in the middle of two 
homologous arms for the target gene. Utilizing the NHEJ-deficient silkworm 
cells, we found that homologous arms as short as 100â€‰bp in donor DNA could be 
designed to perform precise genome editing. These studies should greatly 
accelerate investigations into genome editing of silkworm.
