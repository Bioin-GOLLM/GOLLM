OBJECTIVE: To determine whether deuterium enrichment on carbons 5 and 3 (C5/C3) 
in plasma glucose is influenced by processes other than gluconeogenesis and, if 
so, whether these processes are altered by type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, 10 obese diabetic and 10 obese 
nondiabetic subjects were infused intravenously with [3,5-(2)H(2)] galactose 
enriched at a C5-to-C3 ratio of 1.0 as well as the enrichment of deuterium on C5 
and C3 of plasma glucose, measured with nuclear magnetic resonance using the 
acetaminophen glucuronide method.
RESULTS: The ratio of deuterium enrichment on C5 and C3 of glucose was <1 (P < 
0.001) in all of the diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, resulting in a means +/- 
SE C5-to-C3 ratio that did not differ between groups (0.81 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.79 +/- 
0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: That the C5-to-C3 glucose ratio is <1 indicates that transaldolase 
exchange, selective retention of deuterium at the level of the triose-isomerase 
reaction, or both occur in humans. This also indicates that the net effect of 
these processes on the C5-to-C3 ratio is the same in people with and without 
type 2 diabetes. The possible effects of transaldolase exchange or selective 
retention of deuterium (or tritium) at the level of the triose-isomerase 
reaction on tracee labeling and tracer metabolism should be considered when the 
deuterated water method is used to measure gluconeogenesis or [3-(3)H] glucose 
is used to measure glucose turnover in humans.
