Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential hormone for plants to survive environmental 
stresses. At the center of the ABA signaling network is a subfamily of type 2C 
protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), which form exclusive interactions with ABA 
receptors and subfamily 2 Snfl-related kinase (SnRK2s). Here, we report a 
SnRK2-PP2C complex structure, which reveals marked similarity in PP2C 
recognition by SnRK2 and ABA receptors. In the complex, the kinase activation 
loop docks into the active site of PP2C, while the conserved ABA-sensing 
tryptophan of PP2C inserts into the kinase catalytic cleft, thus mimicking 
receptor-PP2C interactions. These structural results provide a simple mechanism 
that directly couples ABA binding to SnRK2 kinase activation and highlight a new 
paradigm of kinase-phosphatase regulation through mutual packing of their 
catalytic sites.
