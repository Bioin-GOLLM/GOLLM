A 57-year-old white woman had serum ferritin 793 ng/mL, HFE C282Y homozygosity, 
elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, 3+ hepatocyte iron, 
cirrhosis, hepatic granulomas, and portal hypertension. Her 37-year-old son had 
ferritin 869 ng/mL, C282Y/wt, elevated ACE levels, 2+ hepatocyte iron, bridging 
fibrosis, and hepatic granulomas. Her daughters had HFE C282Y/H63D and C282Y/wt, 
respectively; neither had a hemochromatosis phenotype, sarcoid, or severe liver 
disease. All 4 subjects had nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis. Sarcoid did not 
segregate with the human leukocyte antigen-A and -B haplotype shared by the 
proband, her son, and 1 daughter. Phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion in the 
proband and her son yielded 1.6 and 1.5 g iron, respectively; their ACE levels 
remained elevated. We reviewed previous reports of 4 patients with 
hemochromatosis and sarcoid. We conclude that a combination of sarcoid, 
steatosis, and excessive hepatocyte iron caused cirrhosis or hepatic fibrosis in 
the proband and her son.
