BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma accounts for approximately 40% of lung cancer 
cases and poses a serious threat to human health. Therefore, there is an urgent 
need to identify central biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: We first identified the EMT-associated genes in LUAD based on the TCGA 
cohort. Then we screened these 90 EMT-associated genes using univariate Cox 
regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis to develop a prognostic gene 
signature in the training set. The predictive performance of the gene signature 
was assessed in the validation set and multiple external test sets using the ROC 
cure, C index and log-rank tests. RT-PCR, western blot, wound healing assays, 
and siRNA methods were further used to investigate the role of PLEK2 in tumor 
behaviors.
RESULTS: Eight genes (CCNB1, PLEK2, DERL3, C1QTNF6, DLGAP5, HMMR, GJB3, and 
SPOCK1) were eventually selected to develop an eight-gene signature. The 5-year 
AUC of the gene signature has a robust predictive ability both for predicting 
overall survival (0.774, 0.756, and 0.669 in the external test sets, 
respectively), and for progression free survival (0.774, 0.746, and 0.755 in the 
external test sets, respectively). C-index of the gene signature was 0.961 ± 
0.005, 0.916 ± 0.011, and 0.868 ± 0.234 in the external test sets, respectively. 
Four genes (C1QTNF6, DLGAP5, HMMR, and PLEK2) were identified as key genes in 
LUAD progression, which were upregulated in the cancerous tissue compared with 
in the normal tissue (P < 0.001), and correlated with an unwanted prognosis in 
lung cancer (P < 0.05). PLEK2 was used as an example to explore its effect on 
LUAD progression in vitro using RT-PCR, western blot, CCK8, si-RNA and wound 
healing assay. Silencing of PLEK2 was shown to reduce proliferative and migrated 
ability of lung cancer cells via prohibition of autophagy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a novel EMT-related gene signature benefiting 
precision medicine, and identified four pivotal genes which can serve as 
therapeutic targets in LUAD. Four key genes can serve as molecular targets for 
patients with LUAD; silencing of PLEK2 was shown to reduce proliferative and 
migrated ability of lung cancer cells via prohibition of autophagy.
