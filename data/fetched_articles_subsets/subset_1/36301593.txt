Background. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an ever-increasing global health 
concern. One crucial facet in tackling the AMR epidemic is earlier and more 
accurate AMR diagnosis, particularly in the dangerous and highly 
multi-drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Objectives. We 
aimed to develop two SYBR Green-based mismatch amplification mutation assays 
(SYBR-MAMAs) targeting GyrA T83I (gyrA248) and GyrA D87N, D87Y and D87H 
(gyrA259). Together, these variants cause the majority of fluoroquinolone (FQ) 
AMR in P. aeruginosa.Methods. Following assay validation, the gyrA248 and 
gyrA259 SYBR-MAMAs were tested on 84 Australian clinical P. aeruginosa isolates, 
46 of which demonstrated intermediate/full ciprofloxacin resistance according to 
antimicrobial susceptibility testing.Results. Our two SYBR-MAMAs correctly 
predicted an AMR phenotype in the majority (83%) of isolates with 
intermediate/full FQ resistance. All FQ-sensitive strains were predicted to have 
a sensitive phenotype. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed 100 % concordance with 
SYBR-MAMA genotypes.Conclusions. Our GyrA SYBR-MAMAs provide a rapid and 
cost-effective method for same-day identification of FQ AMR in P. aeruginosa. An 
additional SYBR-MAMA targeting the GyrB S466Y/S466F variants would increase FQ 
AMR prediction to 91 %. Clinical implementation of our assays will permit more 
timely treatment alterations in cases where decreased FQ susceptibility is 
identified, leading to improved patient outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship.
