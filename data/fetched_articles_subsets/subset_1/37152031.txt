BACKGROUND: Nephron sparing nephrectomy may not reduce the prognosis of 
nephroblastoma in the absence of involvement of the renal capsule, sinus 
vessels, and lymph nodes, However, there is no accurate preoperative noninvasive 
evaluation method at present.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 105 nephroblastoma patients underwent contrast-enhanced 
CT scan between 2013 and 2020 in our hospital were retrospectively collected, 
including 59 cases with localized stage and 46 cases with non-localized stage, 
and then were divided into training cohort (n= 73) and validation cohort (n= 32) 
according to the order of CT scanning time. After lesion segmentation and data 
preprocessing, radiomic features were extracted from each volume of interest. 
The multi-step procedure including Pearson correlation analysis and sequential 
forward floating selection was performed to produce radiomic signature. 
Prediction model was constructed using the radiomic signature and Logistic 
Regression classifier for predicting the localized nephroblastoma in the 
training cohort. Finally, the model performance was validated in the validation 
cohort.
RESULTS: A total of 1652 radiomic features have been extracted, from which TOP 
10 features were selected as the radiomic signature. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the 
prediction model were 0.796, 0.795, 0.732 and 0.875 for the training cohort 
respectively, and 0.710, 0.719, 0.611 and 0.857 for the validation cohort 
respectively. The result comparison with prediction models composed of different 
machine learning classifiers and different parameters also manifest the 
effectiveness of our radiomic model.
CONCLUSION: A logistic regression model based on radiomic features extracted 
from preoperative CT images had good ability to noninvasively predict 
nephroblastoma without renal capsule, sinus vessel, and lymph node involvement.
