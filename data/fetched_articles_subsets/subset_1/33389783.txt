Ralstonia solanacearum causes bacterial wilt disease in many plant species. Type 
III-secreted effectors (T3Es) play crucial roles in bacterial pathogenesis. 
However, some T3Es are recognized by corresponding disease resistance proteins 
and activate plant immunity. In this study, we identified the R. solanacearum 
T3E protein RipAZ1 (Ralstonia injected protein AZ1) as an avirulence determinant 
in the black nightshade species Solanum americanum. Based on the S. americanum 
accession-specific avirulence phenotype of R. solanacearum strain Pe_26, 12 
candidate avirulence T3Es were selected for further analysis. Among these 
candidates, only RipAZ1 induced a cell death response when transiently expressed 
in a bacterial wilt-resistant S. americanum accession. Furthermore, loss of 
ripAZ1 in the avirulent R. solanacearum strain Pe_26 resulted in acquired 
virulence. Our analysis of the natural sequence and functional variation of 
RipAZ1 demonstrated that the naturally occurring C-terminal truncation results 
in loss of RipAZ1-triggered cell death. We also show that the 213 amino acid 
central region of RipAZ1 is sufficient to induce cell death in S. americanum. 
Finally, we show that RipAZ1 may activate defence in host cell cytoplasm. Taken 
together, our data indicate that the nucleocytoplasmic T3E RipAZ1 confers 
R. solanacearum avirulence in S. americanum. Few avirulence genes are known in 
vascular bacterial phytopathogens and ripAZ1 is the first one in R. solanacearum 
that is recognized in black nightshades. This work thus opens the way for the 
identification of disease resistance genes responsible for the specific 
recognition of RipAZ1, which can be a source of resistance against the 
devastating bacterial wilt disease.
