Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is currently considered to be an important 
therapeutic method, which obtained FDA approval for clinical use in gastric 
cancer in 2017. As a new mechanism, it was found that the effect of αPDL1 could 
be improved by blocking the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, which converts the tumor 
immune microenvironment from the "immune-excluded phenotype" to the 
"immune-inflamed phenotype". Based on this phenomenon, this project was designed 
to prepare TGF-β1-siRNA-loaded PEG-PCL nanoparticles conjugated to αPDL1 
(siTGF-β1-αPDL1-PEG-PCL) since we have linked similar antibodies to PEG-PCL 
previously. Therefore, MFC tumor-engrafted mice were established to simulate the 
biological characteristics of converting the phenotype of the immune 
microenvironment, and to study the anti-tumor effect and possible molecular 
mechanism. In this study, αPDL1 antibody conjugates markedly increased the cell 
uptake of NPs. The produced αPDL1-PEG-PCL NPs efficiently reduced the amounts of 
TGF-β1 mRNA in MFC cells, converting the immune microenvironment of MFC tumors 
engrafted mice from the "immune-excluded phenotype" to the "immune-inflamed 
phenotype". PDL1-harboring gastric cancer had increased susceptibility to αPDL1. 
The value of this drug-controlled release system targeting the tumor 
microenvironment in immune checkpoint therapy of gastric cancer would provide a 
scientific basis for clinically applying nucleic acid drugs.
