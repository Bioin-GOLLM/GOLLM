BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a disease that affects all family members. Parents of 
children with type 1 diabetes are always concerned about all aspects of 
children's life. The aim of this study was to elucidate the process of managing 
children with diabetes in the family.

dissertation, which was done on 2016. The 18 participants were selected through 
purposive and theoretical sampling until data saturation. The main participants 
in this study included parents, siblings, and children with type 1 diabetes. The 
data was gathered by semi-structured interviews as well as field notes and 
memos. Data analysis was done concurrently with data collection in four levels, 
including data analysis for concept and contex, bringing the process into the 
analysis, and integration of categories according to Corbin and Struss (2008). 
Core category appeared at the end of integrated categories.
RESULTS: "The family with diabetes in the child's diabetes orbit" as a core 
category contains the process of managing children with diabetes within the 
family, which included three main subcategories, including "entering into the 
diabetes orbit", "movement into the diabetes orbit", and "living into the 
diabetes orbit".

child's diabetes orbit "as a main concern of families with diabetes suffering 
diabetes attempt to select and practicing appropriate strategies and manage
