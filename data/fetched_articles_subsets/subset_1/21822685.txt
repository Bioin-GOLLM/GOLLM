Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), a recently described risk factor 
for breast cancer, plays important roles in cell growth, invasiveness, motility, 
and angiogenesis. In attempt to investigate whether FGFR2 polymorphisms are 
associated with a risk of breast cancer in Chinese women of the Han nationality, 
we genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of seven FGFR2 sites 
(rs2981582, rs17102287, rs17542768, rs10510097, rs11200012, rs3750817, 
rs2981578) in 816 women including 388 breast cancer patients and 428 healthy 
controls via the polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation 
polymorphism procedure as well as sequence detection. Our results suggest that 
the A allele and AA genotype of SNP rs2981578 appear to be protective factors 
associated with breast cancer, while the CT genotype of SNP rs3750817 is a 
putative risk factor.
