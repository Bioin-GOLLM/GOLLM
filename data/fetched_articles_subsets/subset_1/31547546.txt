Fungal diseases have been underestimated worldwide but constitute a substantial 
threat to several plant and animal species as well as to public health. The 
increase in the global population has entailed an increase in the demand for 
agriculture in recent decades. Accordingly, there has been worldwide pressure to 
find means to improve the quality and productivity of agricultural crops. 
Antifungal agents have been widely used as an alternative for managing fungal 
diseases affecting several crops. However, the unregulated use of antifungals 
can jeopardize public health. Application of fungicides in agriculture should be 
under strict regulation to ensure the toxicological safety of commercialized 
foods. This review discusses the use of antifungals in agriculture worldwide, 
the need to develop new antifungals, and improvement of regulations regarding 
antifungal use.
