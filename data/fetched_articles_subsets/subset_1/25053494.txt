An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) is a sensitive technique for 
detecting protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions in which complexes are 
separated by native (non-denaturing) gel electrophoresis. EMSAs can provide 
evidence for specific binding between components prepared from a wide range of 
sources, including not only highly purified proteins but also components of 
crude cellular extracts. EMSA experiments were critical in identifying the 
minimal protein requirements for assembly of transcriptionally active nuclear 
Notch complexes as well as the DNA sequence specificity of Notch transcription 
complexes. Here, we describe a radioactive EMSA protocol for detection of Notch 
transcription complexes.
