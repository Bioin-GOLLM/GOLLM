OBJECTIVE: To clarify advantages and disadvantages of using multiplex 
ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for detecting exonic deletions and 
duplications of the Dystrophin gene, and to explore the appropriate management 
for single-exon abnormality detected by MLPA.
METHODS: MLPA were performed to detect exonic copy number changes in 70 
Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) patients diagnosed by clinical and 
histological findings. PCR, DNA sequencing and real-time PCR were applied to the 
samples in which MLPA indicated single-exon deletion or duplication.
RESULTS: Of all 70 patients, MLPA detected exonic deletions in 42 (60%), 
including 12 with single-exon deletion and one with ambiguous single-exon 
deletion. Exon duplications were found in 7 patients (10%), among which two were 
single-exon duplication. 21 patients showed normal results (30%). For the 12 
patients with single-exon deletion, MLPA results were confirmed by PCR in 11. In 
one patient, a deletion of two nucleotides (c.4470-4471delAA) was found by 
sequencing. A novel two-nucleotide deletion (c.4746-4747delCT) was identified in 
the patient with the ambiguous single-exon deletion. For the two patients showed 
single-exon duplication, MLPA results were confirmed by real-time PCR.
CONCLUSION: MLPA should be the first choice in detecting Dystrophin gene exon 
deletions and duplications. Single-exon deletion/duplication resulted from MLPA 
should be further evaluated by other methods.
