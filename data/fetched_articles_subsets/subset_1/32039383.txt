Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of chronic liver 
disease, encompassing a spectrum from non-alcoholic fatty liver to non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis, which can progress to cirrhosis. It has recently been 
recognised that NAFLD also occurs in individuals who are not obese, especially 
in Asian populations. In these patients, NAFLD manifests at lower overall body 
mass index thresholds in the presence of increased visceral adipose tissue. 
Currently, the principles of clinical management are similar to those in obese 
individuals, although, in specific regions and clinical situations, unique 
aetiologies of NAFLD must be treated specifically.
