Loss of endoplasmic reticular (ER) Ca2+ activates store-operated Ca2+ entry 
(SOCE) by causing the ER localized Ca2+ sensor STIM to unfurl domains that 
activate Orai channels in the plasma membrane at membrane contact sites (MCS). 
Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which the inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 
receptor (IP3R), an ER-localized IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, regulates neuronal 
SOCE. In human neurons, SOCE evoked by pharmacological depletion of ER-Ca2+ is 
attenuated by loss of IP3Rs, and restored by expression of IP3Rs even when they 
cannot release Ca2+, but only if the IP3Rs can bind IP3. Imaging studies 
demonstrate that IP3Rs enhance association of STIM1 with Orai1 in neuronal cells 
with empty stores; this requires an IP3-binding site, but not a pore. Convergent 
regulation by IP3Rs, may tune neuronal SOCE to respond selectively to receptors 
that generate IP3.
