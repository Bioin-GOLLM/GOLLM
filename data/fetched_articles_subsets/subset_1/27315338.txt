Chemical modifications to genomic DNA can expand and shape its coding potential. 
Cytosine methylation in particular has well-established roles in regulating gene 
expression and defining cellular identity. The discovery of TET family enzymes 
opened a major frontier beyond DNA methylation, revealing three oxidized forms 
of cytosine that could mediate DNA demethylation or encode independent 
epigenetic functions. Chemical biology has been instrumental in uncovering TET's 
intricate reaction mechanisms and scope of reactivity on a surprising variety of 
substrates. Moreover, innovative chemoenzymatic strategies have enabled 
sensitive detection of oxidized cytosine products in vitro and in vivo. We 
highlight key recent developments that demonstrate how chemical biology is 
advancing our understanding of the extended, dynamic epigenome.
