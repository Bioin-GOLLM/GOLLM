inhibitors in depressed Japanese patients.

BACKGROUND: We investigated the relationship between a brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism (Val66Met) and the clinical response of 
patients with major depressive disorder to selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs; here, paroxetine and sertraline). In addition, serum BDNF 
levels in these patients were considered together with the clinical response.
METHODS: A total of 132 patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for major 
depressive disorder were enrolled in the study. 54 of these patients were male 
and 78 were female (age range, 20-74years; mean±S.D., 51±15). The patients' 
clinical improvement was evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression (HAMD-17) before (T0) and at 8weeks after the administration of SSRI 
treatment (T8). Patients with at least a 50% decrease in the HAMD-17 score were 
classified as responders.
RESULTS: No correlation was observed between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and 
response to SSRIs or between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and serum BDNF 
levels at T0. An inverse correlation was found between serum BDNF levels and 
HAMD-17 scores at T0.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is 
independent of both the response to SSRI treatment and serum BDNF levels. The 
findings in the present study reconfirm that the serum BDNF level is a state 
biomarker for depression.
