Eukaryotic cells rely on endocytosis to regulate their plasma membrane proteome 
and lipidome. Most eukaryotic groups, except fungi and animals, have retained 
the evolutionary ancient TSET complex as an endocytic regulator. Unlike other 
coatomer complexes, structural insight into TSET is lacking. Here, we reveal the 
molecular architecture of plant TSET [TPLATE complex (TPC)] using an integrative 
structural approach. We identify crucial roles for specific TSET subunits in 
complex assembly and membrane interaction. Our data therefore generate fresh 
insight into the differences between the hexameric TSET in Dictyostelium and the 
octameric TPC in plants. Structural elucidation of this ancient adaptor complex 
represents the missing piece in the coatomer puzzle and vastly advances our 
functional as well as evolutionary insight into the process of endocytosis.
