BACKGROUND: Patients with germline/somatic BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations (g/sBRCA1/2) 
comprise a distinct biologic subgroup of pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: Institutional databases were queried to identify patients who had PDAC 
with g/sBRCA1/2. Demographics, clinicopathologic details, genomic data 
(annotation sBRCA1/2 according to a precision oncology knowledge base for 
somatic mutations), zygosity, and outcomes were abstracted. Overall survival 
(OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: In total, 136 patients with g/sBRCA1/2 were identified between January 
2011 and June 2020. Germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) mutation was identified in 116 
patients (85%). Oncogenic somatic BRCA1/2 (sBRCA1/2) mutation was present in 20 
patients (15%). Seventy-seven patients had biallelic BRCA1/2 mutations (83%), 
and 16 (17%) had heterozygous mutations. Sixty-five patients with stage IV 
disease received frontline platinum therapy, and 52 (80%) had a partial 
response. The median OS for entire cohort was 27.6 months (95% CI, 24.9-34.5 
months), and the median OS for patients who had stage IV disease was 23 months 
(95% CI, 19-26 months). Seventy-one patients received a poly(adenosine 
diphosphate ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi), and 52 received PARPi 
monotherapy. For maintenance PARPi, 10 patients (36%) had a partial response, 12 
(43%) had stable disease, and 6 (21%) had progression of disease as their best 
response. Six patients (21%) received maintenance PARPi for >2 years. For those 
with stage IV disease who received frontline platinum, the median OS was 26 
months (95% CI, 20-52 months) for biallelic patients (n = 39) and 8.66 months 
(95% CI, 6.2 months to not reached) for heterozygous patients (n = 4). The 
median OS for those who received PARPi therapy was 26.5 months (95% CI, 24-53 
months) for biallelic patients (n = 25) and 8.66 months (95% CI, 7.23 months to 
not reached) for heterozygous patients (n = 2).
CONCLUSIONS: g/sBRCA1/2 mutations did not appear to have different actionable 
utility. Platinum and PARPi therapies offer therapeutic benefit, and very 
durable outcomes are observed in a subset of patients who have g/sBRCA1/2 
mutations with biallelic status.
