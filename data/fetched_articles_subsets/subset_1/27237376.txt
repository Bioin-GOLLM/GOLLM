Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are a hallmark of ideal pluripotent stem cells. 
Epigenetic reprogramming of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has not been 
fully accomplished. iPSC generation is similar to somatic cell nuclear transfer 
(SCNT) in oocytes, and this procedure can be used to generate ESCs (SCNT-ESCs), 
which suggests the contribution of oocyte-specific constituents. Here, we show 
that the mammalian oocyte-specific linker histone H1foo has beneficial effects 
on iPSC generation. Induction of H1foo with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 significantly 
enhanced the efficiency of iPSC generation. H1foo promoted in vitro 
differentiation characteristics with low heterogeneity in iPSCs. H1foo enhanced 
the generation of germline-competent chimeric mice from iPSCs in a manner 
similar to that for ESCs. These findings indicate that H1foo contributes to the 
generation of higher-quality iPSCs.
