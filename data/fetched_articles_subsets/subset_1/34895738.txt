BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infection increases mortality in hematological 
malignancies. In a large meta-analysis, patients aged 60 years and older had a 
significantly higher risk of death than patients under 60 years of age [1]. 
Furthermore, a high risk of death and reduced survival in patients receiving B 
cell depletion therapy with prolonged COVID-19 infection was reported in a 
recent study [2]. High-grade B-cell lymphomas are classified as morphologically 
aggressive lymphomas with the presence of a high mitotic index and Ki-67 
proliferation rates. They demonstrate aggressive behavior clinically as well as 
morphologically, and COVID-19 infection is an important factor that increases 
mortality in these patients. Herein, we present an elderly patient with a 
diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma, in whom a complete response was 
observed after prolonged COVID-19 infection.
CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old female patient received her first cycle of R-CHOP 
(rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone) treatment after 
being diagnosed with high- grade B-cell lymphoma. After being discharged from 
the hospital, the patient was referred to the emergency department with 
complaints of fever and fatigue when she came for the second cycle of 
chemotherapy. Her COVID-19 PCR test was found positive. She was admitted to the 
infectious diseases service and favipiravir treatment was started. On the 24th 
day of hospitalization, it was decided to perform interim FDG-PET/CT 
(Fluorodeoxyglucose - Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) scan at 
a time that her PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test was still positive. A 
complete metabolic response was detected in her imaging. On the 26th day, the 
PCR test became negative and the patient was transferred to the oncology service 
and received the second cycle of R-CHOP treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our case emphasizes that antitumor effect could be seen in a patient 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a hematologic malignancy. It also highlights being 
alert to prolonged COVID-19 infection in patients receiving B-cell depletion 
therapy.
