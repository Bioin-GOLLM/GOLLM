Overexpressed Mdm2 and its 7homolog MdmX impair p53 activity in many cancers. 
Small molecules mimicking a p53 peptide can effectively inhibit Mdm2 but not 
MdmX. Here, we show a strategy for improving lead compounds for Mdm2 and MdmX 
inhibition based on the multivalency of the p53 peptide. Crystal structures of 
MdmX complexed with nutlin-3a, a strong Mdm2 inhibitor but a weak one for MdmX, 
reveal that nutlin-3a fits into the ligand binding pocket of MdmX mimicking the 
p53 peptide. However, due to distinct flexibility around the MdmX ligand binding 
pocket, the structures are missing many important intermolecular interactions 
that exist in the MdmX/p53 peptide and Mdm2/nultin-3a complexes. By targeting 
these flexible regions, we identify allosteric and additive fragments that 
enhance the binding affinity of nutlin-3a for MdmX, leading to potent Mdm2/MdmX 
inhibitors with anticancer activity. Our work provides a practical approach to 
drug design for signal transduction therapy.
