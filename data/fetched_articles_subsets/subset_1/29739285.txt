Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is diagnosed when pregnancy failure occurs 
after 2 consecutive in vitro fertilization-embryo transfers (IVF-ET) to the 
endometrium using at least 4 high-quality embryos. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a 
class of small noncoding RNA and reported to play an important role in cell 
proliferation as well as implantation process. Recently, it has been reported 
that miRNA can regulate RIF occurrence. So, we were to examine the association 
between the specific miRNA polymorphisms and RIF in Korean women. Genotyping was 
performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP) assay to determine the frequency of the following polymorphisms: 
miR-605A>G, miR-608G>C, miR-631I>D, miR-938C>T, and miR-1302-3C>T. Our results 
demonstrate a decreased incidence of RIF in patients with the miR-1302-3C>T 
polymorphism (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.234; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.089-0.618; P = .003). Based on our allele combination analysis, the C-T ( 
miR-938/ miR-1302-3: OR = 0.259; 95% CI, 0.100-0.674; P = .003) allele was also 
associated with decreased RIF risk. From our interaction analysis with 
miR-1302-3, the miR-1302-3CC genotype (AOR = 43.332; 95% CI, 5.576-336.745) 
showed an association with RIF prevalence in participants with an activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) â‰¤22.6. We found that the miR-1302-3C>T 
polymorphism is significantly associated with RIF development in Korean women. 
Specifically, our study suggests that the T allele of miR-1302-3 may decrease 
the risk of RIF in Korean women.
