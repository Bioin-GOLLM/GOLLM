Propionic acidemia (PA, OMIM #606054) is a serious, life-threatening, inherited, 
metabolic disorder caused by the deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme 
propionyl-coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.3). The primary objective of 
this study was to conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on 
the epidemiology of PA. The literature search was performed covering Medline, 
Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CRD Database, Academic Search 
Complete, CINAHL and PROSPERO databases. Websites of rare disease organizations 
were also searched for eligible studies. Of the 2338 identified records, 188 
articles were assessed for eligibility in full text, 43 articles reported on 
disease epidemiology, and 31 studies were included into the quantitative 
synthesis. Due to the rarity of PA, broadly targeted population-based prevalence 
studies are not available. Nonetheless, implementation of newborn screening 
programs has allowed the estimation of the birth prevalence data of PA across 
multiple geographic regions. The pooled point estimates indicated detection 
rates of 0.29; 0.33; 0.33 and 4.24 in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America 
and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, respectively. Our 
systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirm that PA is an ultra-rare 
disorder, with similar detection rates across all regions with the exception of 
the MENA region where the disease, similar to other inherited metabolic 
disorders, is more frequent.
