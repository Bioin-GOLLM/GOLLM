Telomere associations have been observed during key cellular processes such as 
mitosis, meiosis, and carcinogenesis and must be resolved before cell division 
to prevent genome instability. Here we establish that telomeric repeat-binding 
factor 1 (TRF1), a core component of the telomere protein complex, is a mediator 
of telomere associations in mammalian cells. Using live-cell imaging, we show 
that expression of TRF1 or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-TRF1 fusion protein 
above endogenous levels prevents proper telomere resolution during mitosis. TRF1 
overexpression results in telomere anaphase bridges and aggregates containing 
TRF1 protein and telomeric DNA. Site-specific protein cleavage of YFP-TRF1 by 
tobacco etch virus protease resolves telomere aggregates, indicating that 
telomere associations are mediated by TRF1. This study provides novel insight 
into the formation and resolution of telomere associations.
