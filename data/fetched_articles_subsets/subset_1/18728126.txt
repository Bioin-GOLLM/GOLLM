Thyroid hormone is a critical regulator of growth, development, and metabolism 
in virtually all tissues, and altered thyroid status affects many organs and 
systems. Although for many years testis has been regarded as a thyroid hormone 
unresponsive organ, it is now evident that thyroid hormone plays an important 
role in testicular development and function. A considerable amount of data show 
that thyroid hormone influences steroidogenesis as well as spermatogenesis. The 
involvement of tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) in the control of Sertoli cell 
proliferation and functional maturation is widely accepted, as well as its role 
in postnatal Leydig cell differentiation and steroidogenesis. The presence of 
thyroid hormone receptors in testicular cells throughout development and in 
adulthood implies that T(3) may act directly on these cells to bring about its 
effects. Several recent studies have employed different methodologies and 
techniques in an attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying thyroid hormone 
effects on testicular cells. The current review aims at presenting an updated 
picture of the recent advances made regarding the role of thyroid hormones in 
male gonadal function.
