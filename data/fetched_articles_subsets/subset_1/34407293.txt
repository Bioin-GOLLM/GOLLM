BACKGROUND: Carriers of the G2019S mutation of LRRK2 provide a great opportunity 
to investigate the premotor stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). We have studied 
by serial clinical and dopamine transporter single photon emission computed 
tomography (DaT-SPECT) evaluations a cohort of asymptomatic carriers of the 
LRRK2-G2019S mutation in order to evaluate the usefulness of these tools as 
biomarkers. Here we report the results of the extended follow-up of this cohort 
at 8 years.
METHODS: Seventeen participants, of the 25 available from the 4-year evaluation, 
completed the 8-year assessment. UPDRS-III, UPSIT test and DaT-SPECT imaging 
(123 I-ioflupane) were performed. We used repeated-measures linear mixed effects 
models to examine the changes in DaT binding over time.
RESULTS: Three carriers had converted to PD at 4 years. One additional carrier 
converted at 8 years. PD-converters had lower striatal DaT binding at baseline 
than non-converters. There was a significant decline of DaT binding over time, 
with a mean annual rate of 3.5%, with somewhat inter-individual and 
intra-individual variability and comparable between PD-converters and 
non-converters. No carrier with DAT binding ratio above an undefined threshold 
between 0.5 and 0.8 developed PD symptoms. The age-adjusted UPSIT score did not 
change significantly over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of conversion to PD at 8 years in this cohort aged 
~58 years at baseline was 16%. The observed decline of DaT binding over time and 
its association with the phenotype render DaT-SPECT a potentially useful tool 
for monitoring the premotor stage of the disease, although at the individual 
level its ability to predict phenoconversion is limited.
