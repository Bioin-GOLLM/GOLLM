INTRODUCTION: Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is an 
autosomal recessive mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder and presents as 
hypoketotic hypoglycemia or rhabdomyolysis during childhood. l-Carnitine 
supplementation for patients with VLCAD deficiency is controversial. Herein, we 
describe two siblings with VLCAD deficiency who experienced more frequent 
episodes of rhabdomyolysis after l-carnitine supplementation.
CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 involved a 6-year-old boy who was diagnosed with VLCAD 
deficiency after repeated episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia at 3 years of 
age. He developed rhabdomyolysis more frequently after starting l-carnitine 
supplementation. Case 2 involved an 8-year-old boy, the elder brother of case 1, 
who was also diagnosed with VLCAD deficiency by sibling screening at the age of 
5 years. He first developed rhabdomyolysis during a common cold after treatment 
with l-carnitine. Both patients had fewer rhabdomyolysis episodes after the 
cessation of l-carnitine supplementation.
CONCLUSION: Our cases suggest that l-carnitine supplementation can increase 
rhabdomyolysis attacks in patients with VLCAD deficiency.
