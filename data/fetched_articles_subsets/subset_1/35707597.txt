Spinal muscular atrophy, X-linked 2 (SMAX2) is a rare type of spinal muscular 
atrophy characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, areflexia, myopathic face, 
tongue fibrillations, contractures, bone fractures, and cryptorchidism. Variants 
of the UBA1 gene lead to SMAX2. The UBA1 gene encodes a protein that activates 
the ubiquitin pathway which is responsible for protein degradation. Here, we 
describe a family presenting with hypotonia, muscle weakness, areflexia, 
contractures, weak cry, in association with other anomalies including myopathic 
face, scoliosis, tongue fibrillations, and cryptorchidism. Molecular analysis in 
2 patients revealed a hemizygous pathogenic variant in the UBA1 gene 
(NM_153280.3, NP_695012.1: c.1731C>T [p.Asn577Asn]) inherited from their carrier 
mothers. Our study presents the first patients from Turkey, widening the 
phenotypic spectrum of SMAX2 by pectus carinatum, medullary sponge kidney, and 
frontal cyst.
