Ichthyoses are genetically determined cornification disorders of the epidermis 
characterized by the presence of different degrees of scaling, hyperkeratosis, 
and erythroderma often associated with palmoplantar keratoderma. Different 
classifications of these diseases have been proposed, often based upon the 
involved genes and/or the clinical presentation. The clinical features of these 
diseases present some overlap of phenotypes among distinct genetic entities, 
depending mainly on the penetrance of mutations. In this study, using a 
clinical, genetic, and molecular approach, we analyzed a family with two 
affected members who had clinical and histological features resembling 
erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) or a type of erythrodermic hyperkeratosis 
with palmoplantar keratoderma. Despite of the clinical presentation, we 
demonstrated that the affected patients were genetically double heterozygous for 
two different mutations in the ABCA12 gene, known to be responsible for 
harlequin ichthyosis. To explain the mild phenotype of our patients, we 
performed a molecular characterization of the skin. In the upper layers of the 
epidermis, the results showed a patchy presence of the glucosyl-ceramides 
(GlcCer), which is the lipid transported by ABCA12, fundamental in contributing 
to skin impermeability. Indeed, the two mutations detected do not completely 
abolish ABCA12 activity, indicating that the mild phenotype is due to a partial 
loss of function of the enzyme, thus giving rise to an intermediate phenotype 
resembling EKVP, due to a partial depletion of GlcCer deposition.
