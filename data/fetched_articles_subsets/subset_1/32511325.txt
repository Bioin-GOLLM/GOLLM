SARS-CoV-2 T cell response assessment and vaccine development may benefit from 
an approach that considers the global landscape of the human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) proteins. We predicted the binding affinity between 9-mer and 15-mer 
peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome for 9,360 class I and 8,445 class II HLA 
alleles, respectively. We identified 368,145 unique combinations of peptide-HLA 
complexes (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity less than 500nM, and 
observed significant overlap between class I and II predicted pMHCs. Using 
simulated populations derived from worldwide HLA frequency data, we identified 
sets of epitopes predicted in at least 90% of the population in 57 countries. We 
also developed a method to prioritize pMHCs for specific populations. 
Collectively, this public dataset and accessible user interface (Shiny app: 
https://rstudio-connect.parkerici.org/content/13/) can be used to explore the 
SARS-CoV-2 epitope landscape in the context of diverse HLA types across global 
populations.
