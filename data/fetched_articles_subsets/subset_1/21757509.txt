Usher syndrome is the most prevalent cause of hereditary deaf-blindness, 
characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing impairment and progressive 
photoreceptor degeneration beginning in childhood or adolescence. Diagnosis and 
management of this disease are complex, and the molecular changes underlying 
sensory cell impairment remain poorly understood. Here we characterize two 
zebrafish models for a severe form of Usher syndrome, Usher syndrome type 1C 
(USH1C): one model is a mutant with a newly identified ush1c nonsense mutation, 
and the other is a morpholino knockdown of ush1c. Both have defects in hearing, 
balance and visual function from the first week of life. Histological analyses 
reveal specific defects in sensory cell structure that are consistent with these 
behavioral phenotypes and could implicate Müller glia in the retinal pathology 
of Usher syndrome. This study shows that visual defects associated with loss of 
ush1c function in zebrafish can be detected from the onset of vision, and thus 
could be applicable to early diagnosis for USH1C patients.
