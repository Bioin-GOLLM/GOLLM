P/Q-type Ca2+ currents mediated by CaV2.1 channels are essential for active 
neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions and many central synapses. 
Mutations in CACNA1A, the gene encoding the principal CaV2.1 α1A subunit, cause 
a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. Typically, gain-of-function (GOF) 
mutations are associated with migraine and epilepsy while loss-of-function (LOF) 
mutations are causative for episodic and congenital ataxias. However, a cluster 
of severe CaV2.1 channelopathies have overlapping presentations which suggests 
that channel dysfunction in these disorders cannot always be defined bimodally 
as GOF or LOF. In particular, the R1667P mutation causes focal seizures, 
generalized hypotonia, dysarthria, congenital ataxia and, in one case, cerebral 
edema leading ultimately to death. Here, we demonstrate that the R1667P mutation 
causes both channel GOF (hyperpolarizing voltage-dependence of activation, 
slowed deactivation) and LOF (slowed activation kinetics) when expressed 
heterologously in tsA-201 cells. We also observed a substantial reduction in 
Ca2+ current density in this heterologous system. These changes in channel 
gating and availability/expression manifested in diminished Ca2+ flux during 
action potential-like stimuli. However, the integrated Ca2+ fluxes were no 
different when normalized to tail current amplitude measured upon repolarization 
from the reversal potential. In summary, our findings indicate a complex 
functional effect of R1667P and support the idea that pathological missense 
mutations in CaV2.1 may not represent exclusively GOF or LOF.
