BACKGROUND: Serum levels of hepcidin-25, a peptide hormone that reduces blood 
iron content, are elevated when patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop 
pulmonary exacerbation (PEx). Because hepcidin-25 is unavailable as a clinical 
laboratory test, we questioned whether a one-time serum iron level was 
associated with the subsequent number of days until PEx, as defined by the need 
to receive systemic antibiotics (ABX) for health deterioration.
METHODS: Clinical, biochemical, and microbiological parameters were 
simultaneously checked in 54 adults with CF. Charts were reviewed to determine 
when they first experienced a PEx after these parameters were assessed. Time to 
ABX was compared in subgroups with and without specific attributes. Multivariate 
linear regression was used to identify parameters that significantly explained 
variation in time to ABX.
RESULTS: In univariate analyses, time to ABX was significantly shorter in 
subjects with Aspergillus-positive sputum cultures and CF-related diabetes. 
Multivariate linear regression models demonstrated that shorter time to ABX was 
associated with younger age, lower serum iron level, and Aspergillus sputum 
culture positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum iron, age, and Aspergillus sputum culture positivity are 
factors associated with shorter time to subsequent PEx in CF adults.
