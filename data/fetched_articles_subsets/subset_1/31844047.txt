Toll-like receptor TLR5 recognizes a conserved domain, termed D1, that is 
present in flagellins of several pathogenic bacteria but not in Helicobacter 
pylori. Highly virulent H. pylori strains possess a type IV secretion system 
(T4SS) for delivery of virulence factors into gastric epithelial cells. Here, we 
show that one of the H. pylori T4SS components, protein CagL, can act as a 
flagellin-independent TLR5 activator. CagL contains a D1-like motif that 
mediates adherence to TLR5+ epithelial cells, TLR5 activation, and downstream 
signaling in vitro. TLR5 expression is associated with H. pylori infection and 
gastric lesions in human biopsies. Using Tlr5-knockout and wild-type mice, we 
show that TLR5 is important for efficient control of H. pylori infection. Our 
results indicate that CagL, by activating TLR5, may modulate immune responses to 
H. pylori.
