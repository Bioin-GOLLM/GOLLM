Synesthesia is experienced when sensory stimulation of one sensory modality 
elicits an involuntary sensation in another sensory modality. Auditory-visual 
synesthesia occurs when auditory stimuli elicit visual sensations. It has 
developmental, induced and acquired varieties. The acquired variety has been 
reported in association with deafferentation of the visual system as well as 
temporal lobe pathology with intact visual pathways. The induced variety has 
been reported in experimental and post-surgical blindfolding, as well as intake 
of hallucinogenic or psychedelics. Although in humans there is no known 
anatomical pathway connecting auditory areas to primary and/or early visual 
association areas, there is imaging and neurophysiologic evidence to the 
presence of early cross modal interactions between the auditory and visual 
sensory pathways. Synesthesia may be a window of opportunity to study these 
cross modal interactions. Here we review the existing literature in the acquired 
and induced auditory-visual synesthesias and discuss the possible neural 
mechanisms.
