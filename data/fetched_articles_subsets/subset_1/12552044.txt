BACKGROUND: Although hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (Hyper-Hcy) may predispose to 
atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis, the mechanisms of stroke associated with 
Hyper-Hcy are not defined.
METHODS: Clinical and biochemical phenotypes and genetic features of three 
unrelated patients with premature stroke and severe Hyper-Hcy due to 
cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency are described. Plasma Hcy and amino 
acids were measured by fluorescence polarization immune assay and ion exchange 
chromatography. Analysis of the CBS and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 
genes was performed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence analysis.
RESULTS: Two of the three index cases had no known diagnosis of homocystinuria 
and initially presented with embolic cerebral and retinal infarction in 
mid-adulthood. Mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease were carotid intraluminal 
thrombosis, arterial dissection, and possible cardiac embolism. Family screening 
revealed additional members with clinically silent homocystinuria and severe 
Hyper-Hcy. Excluding tall stature in two individuals, all had mild phenotypes, 
without classic findings of CBS deficiency. Plasma total and free Hcy, 
methionine, and urine Hcy were elevated. Genotyping revealed heterozygous CBS 
mutations (I278T, D444N, G307S) in affected individuals.
CONCLUSION: Artery-to-artery embolism and dissection may cause stroke in young 
adults with homocystinuria. The results also support a rationale for screening 
for Hyper-Hcy in young adults with stroke without a phenotype suggestive of 
classic homocystinuria.
