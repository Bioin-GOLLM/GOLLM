The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different 
antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development. Previous 
studies showed most strains of laboratory adapted DENV2 particles changed from 
smooth to "bumpy" surfaced morphology when the temperature is switched from 29°C 
at 37°C. Here we identified five envelope (E) protein residues different between 
two alternative passage history DENV2 NGC strains exhibiting smooth or bumpy 
surface morphologies. Several mutations performed on the smooth DENV2 infectious 
clone destabilized the surface, as observed by cryoEM. Molecular dynamics 
simulations demonstrated how chemically subtle substitution at various positions 
destabilized dimeric interactions between E proteins. In contrast, three out of 
four DENV2 clinical isolates showed a smooth surface morphology at 37°C, and 
only at high fever temperature (40°C) did they become "bumpy". These results 
imply vaccines should contain particles representing both morphologies. For 
prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, this study also informs on which types 
of antibodies should be used at different stages of an infection, i.e., those 
that bind to monomeric E proteins on the bumpy surface or across multiple E 
proteins on the smooth surfaced virus.
