An inherited deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase [porphobilinogen 
ammonia-lyase (polymerizing), EC 4.3.1.8] in humans is responsible for the 
autosomal dominant disease acute intermittent porphyria. Different classes of 
mutations have been described at the protein level suggesting that this is a 
heterogeneous disease. It was previously demonstrated that porphobilinogen 
deaminase is encoded by two distinct mRNA species expressed in a tissue-specific 
manner. Analysis of the genomic sequences indicated that these two mRNAs are 
transcribed from two promoters and only differ in their first exon. The first 
mutation identified in the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene is a single-base 
substitution (G----A) in the canonical 5' splice donor site of intron 1. This 
mutation leads to a particular subtype of acute intermittent porphyria 
characterized by the restriction of the enzymatic defect to nonerythropoietic 
tissues. Hybridization analysis using oligonucleotide probes after in vitro 
amplification of genomic DNA offers another possibility of detecting 
asymptomatic carriers of the mutation in affected families.
