Differences between individuals with hemoglobins Istanbul and Saint-Etienne 
(alpha 2 beta 2 92F8 His replaced by Gln).

Aksoy M, Erdem S.

The unstable hemoglobins Istanbul and Saint-Etienne have the same amino acid 
substitution (alpha 2 beta 2 92F8 His leads to Gln). Despite this, there are 
some clinical and hematological differences between the individual with Hb 
Istanbul and the one with Hb Saint-Etienne. These are: (1) the clinical course 
of the patient with Hb Istanbul before splenectomy was more severe when compared 
with that of the individual with Hb Saint-Etienne; (2) although Hb F was found 
within normal range in the individual with Hb Istanbul, a high level of Hb F 
(19%) was observed in the patient with Hb Saint-Etienne. The alkali-resistant Hb 
found in the former was of adult type and in the latter case it was of fetal 
type. The possible explanations for these differences are discussed.
