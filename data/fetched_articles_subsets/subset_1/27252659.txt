P2X purinergic receptors are plasma membrane ATP-dependent cation channels that 
are broadly distributed in the mammalian tissues. P2RX2 is a modulator of 
auditory sensory hair cell mechanotransduction and plays an important role in 
hair cell tolerance to noise. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time 
in vitro and in cochlear neuroepithelium, that P2RX2 possesses the ATPase 
activity. We observed that the P2RX2 V60L human deafness mutation alters its 
ability to bind ATP, while the G353R has no effect on ATP binding or hydrolysis. 
A non-hydrolysable ATP assay using HEK293 cells suggests that ATP hydrolysis 
plays a significant role in the opening and gating of the P2RX2 ion channel. 
Moreover, the results of structural modeling of the molecule was in agreement 
with our experimental observations. These novel findings suggest the intrinsic 
ATPase activity of P2RX2 and provide molecular insights into the channel 
opening.
