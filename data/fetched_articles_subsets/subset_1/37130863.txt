Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the 
leading cause of dementia worldwide. Different pathologic changes have been 
introduced to be involved in its progression. Although amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition 
and tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation are mainly considered the main 
characterizations of AD, several other processes are involved. In recent years, 
several other changes, including alterations in gut microbiota proportion and 
circadian rhythms, have been noticed due to their role in AD progression. 
However, the exact mechanism indicating the association between circadian 
rhythms and gut microbiota abundance has not been investigated yet. This paper 
aims to review the role of gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in AD 
pathophysiology and introduces a hypothesis to explain their association.
