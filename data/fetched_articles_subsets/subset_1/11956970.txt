The use of persons who become alcoholic despite having a well-defined negative 
risk for alcoholism (inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 or ALDH2) is advantageous 
in genetic research because of this population's reduced heterogeneity and 
possible genetic factors conferring susceptibility to alcohol dependence. This 
investigation of central serotonin neurotransmission, specifically the serotonin 
1B (5HT1B) receptor gene and its role in both regulating alcohol consumption and 
developing alcohol dependence revealed overrepresentation of the C allele of the 
861G > C polymorphism of 5HT1B in alcoholics with inactive ALDH2, compared with 
its frequency in nonalcoholic controls. No significant differences in 5HT1B 
genotype and allele distributions were observed between alcoholics with active 
ALDH2 and controls, however. Taken together with recent observations, these 
results suggest that genetic variability of the 5HT1B receptor is involved in 
the development of some type of alcohol dependence.
