BACKGROUND: The promoter variant rs17111237 in the CEP128 closely relates to 
radiotherapy (RT)-related brain necrosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
patients.
PURPOSE: To explore RT-related dynamic alterations in brain morphology and their 
potential genetic mechanism, and to explore the modulatory effects of CEP128 
genetic variants on RT-related brain morphological alterations in NPC patients.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective, longitudinal.
POPULATION: One hundred one patients with histopathologic ally-proven NPC (age 
41.64 ± 9.63, 46 male), analyzed at baseline (pre-RT), 3-months post-RT and 
6 months post-RT, and 19 sex-, age- and education-matched healthy controls.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3D gradient echo brain volume (3D-BRAVO) and 
diffusion-weighted single-shot spin-echo echo-planar sequences at 3.0 T.
ASSESSMENT: rs17111237 in CEP128 was detected by Sanger sequencing. Structural 
and diffusion images were processed with FreeSurfer and FSL. Morphometric 
similarity network (MSN) was constructed with nine cortical indices derived from 
structural and diffusion images.
STATISTICAL TESTS: One-way ANOVA, chi-square test. Pearson's correlation 
analysis was conducted to measure the relationship between CEP128 
gene-expression level in human brain and MSN alterations. Repeated analysis of 
variance performed to assess group differences in MSN and the modulatory effects 
of the CEP128 gene within patients. Significance level: P < 0.05, 
false-discovery rate correction.
RESULTS: RT-related significant widespread MSN alterations were observed in the 
cortices of NPC patients. Notably, regional MSN alterations had a weak but 
significant negative correlation with the cortical pattern of CEP128 gene 
expression (r = -0.152). Furthermore, rs17111237 in the CEP128 had significant 
modulatory effects on the observed MSN alterations in NPC patients, with the 
modulatory effects being most obvious at 3 months post-RT.
CONCLUSIONS: MSN has potential to serve as a sensitive biomarker to detect 
RT-related brain injury. Inter-brain regional and inter-patient variability of 
RT-related brain injuries may be attributed to the cortical expression of the 
CEP128 gene and the modulatory effects of the promoter variant rs17111237 in 
CEP128.
EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.
