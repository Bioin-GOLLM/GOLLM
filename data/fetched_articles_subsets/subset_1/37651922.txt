To better understand sodium channel (SCN5A)-related cardiomyopathies, we 
generated ventricular cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells 
obtained from a dilated cardiomyopathy patient harbouring the R222Q mutation, 
which is only expressed in adult SCN5A isoforms. Because the adult SCN5A isoform 
was poorly expressed, without functional differences between R222Q and control 
in both embryoid bodies and cell sheet preparations (cultured for 29-35 days), 
we created heart-on-a-chip biowires which promote myocardial maturation. Indeed, 
biowires expressed primarily adult SCN5A with R222Q preparations displaying 
(arrhythmogenic) short action potentials, altered Na+ channel biophysical 
properties and lower contractility compared to corrected controls. Comprehensive 
RNA sequencing revealed differential gene regulation between R222Q and control 
biowires in cellular pathways related to sarcoplasmic reticulum and dystroglycan 
complex as well as biological processes related to calcium ion regulation and 
action potential. Additionally, R222Q biowires had marked reductions in actin 
expression accompanied by profound sarcoplasmic disarray, without differences in 
cell composition (fibroblast, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes) compared to 
corrected biowires. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in addition to altering 
cardiac electrophysiology and Na+ current, the R222Q mutation also causes 
profound sarcomere disruptions and mechanical destabilization. Possible 
mechanisms for these observations are discussed.
