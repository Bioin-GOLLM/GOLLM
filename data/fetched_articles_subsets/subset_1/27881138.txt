BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) is a Category A pathogen that is a member of 
Filoviridae family that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human 
primates. Unpredictable and devastating outbreaks of disease have recently 
occurred in Africa and current immunoprophylaxis and therapies are limited. The 
main limitation of working with pathogens like EBOV is the need for costly 
containment. To potentiate further and wider opportunity for EBOV prophylactics 
and therapies development, innovative approaches are necessary.
METHODS: In the present study, an antigen delivery platform based on a 
recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), delivering a synthetic EBOV 
glycoprotein (GP) gene sequence, BoHV-4-syEBOVgD106ΔTK, was generated.
RESULTS: EBOV GP was abundantly expressed by BoHV-4-syEBOVgD106ΔTK transduced 
cells without decreasing viral replication. BoHV-4-syEBOVgD106ΔTK immunized 
goats produced high titers of anti-EBOV GP antibodies and conferred a long 
lasting (up to 6 months), detectable antibody response. Furthermore, no evidence 
of BoHV-4-syEBOVgD106ΔTK viremia and secondary localization was detected in any 
of the immunized animals.
CONCLUSIONS: The BoHV-4-based vector approach described here, represents: an 
alternative antigen delivery system for vaccination and a proof of principle 
study for anti-EBOV antibodies generation in goats for potential immunotherapy 
applications.
