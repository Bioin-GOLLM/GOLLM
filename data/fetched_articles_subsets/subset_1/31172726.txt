Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) is a hereditary autoinflammatory 
syndrome caused by mutations in NLRP3 (encoding cryopyrin), which presents with 
fever, fatigue and arthralgia. Thus far, however there have been no reports of 
CAPS in Korea. Herein, we report 3 cases of CAPS for the first time in Korea. 
The first case, a 28-year-old man with recurrent urticaria, arthralgia and fever 
induced by cold, all of which were observed in his father, showed elevated 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. He exhibited a 
p.Gly303Asp variant of the NLPR3 gene. The second case, a 2-year-old girl who 
had recurrent urticaria, arthritis and oral and genital ulcers, was positive for 
HLA B51 and a p.Glu569Lys mutation in exon 3 of the NLRP3 gene. Administration 
of anakinra greatly improved her symptoms. The third case, a 4-year-old boy who 
presented with recurrent urticaria, arthralgia, and fever, exhibited a 
p.Val72Met mutation in exon 1 of the NLRP3 gene. Administration of tocilizumab 
improved all of his symptoms. This small case series suggests that clinicians 
consider CAPS and conduct genetic studies when arthralgia and fever are 
accompanied by urticaria in Korea.
