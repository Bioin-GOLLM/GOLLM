Deregulation of RNA metabolism has emerged as one of the key events leading to 
the degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) 
disease. Indeed, mutations on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or on proteins 
involved in aspects of RNA metabolism account for the majority of familiar forms 
of ALS. In particular, the impact of the ALS-linked mutations of the RBP FUS on 
many aspects of RNA-related processes has been vastly investigated. FUS plays a 
pivotal role in splicing regulation and its mutations severely alter the exon 
composition of transcripts coding for proteins involved in neurogenesis, axon 
guidance, and synaptic activity. In this study, by using in vitro-derived human 
MNs, we investigate the effect of the P525L FUS mutation on non-canonical 
splicing events that leads to the formation of circular RNAs (circRNAs). We 
observed altered levels of circRNAs in FUSP525L MNs and a preferential binding 
of the mutant protein to introns flanking downregulated circRNAs and containing 
inverted Alu repeats. For a subset of circRNAs, FUSP525L also impacts their 
nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning, confirming its involvement in different 
processes of RNA metabolism. Finally, we assess the potential of cytoplasmic 
circRNAs to act as miRNA sponges, with possible implications in ALS 
pathogenesis.
