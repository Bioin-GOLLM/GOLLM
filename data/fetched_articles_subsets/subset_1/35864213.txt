Recently, an intronic biallelic (AAGGG)n repeat expansion in RFC1 was shown to 
be a cause of CANVAS and adult-onset ataxia in multiple populations. As the 
prevalence of the RFC1 repeat expansion in Dutch cases was unknown, we 
retrospectively tested 9 putative CANVAS cases and two independent cohorts (A 
and B) of 395 and 222 adult-onset ataxia cases, respectively, using the 
previously published protocol and, for the first time optical genome mapping to 
determine the size of the expanded RFC1 repeat. We identified the biallelic 
(AAGGG)n repeat expansion in 5/9 (55%) putative CANVAS patients and in 10/617 
(1.6%; cohorts A + B) adult-onset ataxia patients. In addition to the AAGGG 
repeat motif, we observed a putative GAAGG repeat motif in the repeat expansion 
with unknown significance in two adult-onset ataxia patients. All the expanded 
(AAGGG)n repeats identified were in the range of 800-1299 repeat units. The 
intronic biallelic RFC1 repeat expansion thus explains a number of the Dutch 
adult-onset ataxia cases that display the main clinical features of CANVAS, and 
particularly when ataxia is combined with neuropathy. The yield of screening for 
RFC1 expansions in unselected cohorts is relatively low. To increase the current 
diagnostic yield in ataxia patients, we suggest adding RFC1 screening to the 
genetic diagnostic workflow by using advanced techniques that attain long 
fragments.
