Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a remarkably heterogeneous 
disease with around 50% mortality, a fact that has prompted researchers to try 
new approaches to improve patient survival. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) is the 
rate-limiting step for heme degradation into carbon monoxide, free iron and 
biliverdin. We have previously reported that HO-1 protein is upregulated in 
human HNSCC samples and that it is localized in the cytoplasmic and nuclear 
compartments; additionally, we have demonstrated that HO-1 nuclear localization 
is associated with malignant progression. In this work, by using pharmacological 
and genetic experimental approaches, we begin to elucidate the mechanisms 
through which HO-1 plays a role in HNSCC. We found that high HO-1 mRNA was 
associated with decreased patient survival in early stages of HNSCC. In vitro 
experiments have shown that full-length HO-1 localizes in the cytoplasm, and 
that, depending on its enzymatic activity, it increases cell viability and 
promotes cell cycle progression. Instead, HO-1 does not alter migration 
capacity. Furthermore, we show that C-terminal truncated HO-1 localizes into the 
nucleus, increases cell viability and promotes cell cycle progression. In 
conclusion, we herein demonstrate that HO-1 displays protumor activities in 
HNSCC that depend, at least in part, on the nuclear localization of HO-1.
