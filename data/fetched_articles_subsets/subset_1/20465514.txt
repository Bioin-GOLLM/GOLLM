Abstract Protein-protein interactions play fundamental roles in most biological 
processes. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a promising method 
for its simplicity and direct visualization of protein-protein interactions in 
cells. This method, however, is limited by background fluorescence that appears 
without specific interaction between the proteins. We report here a point 
mutation (V150L) in one Venus BiFC fragment that efficiently decreases 
background fluorescence of BiFC assay. Furthermore, by combining this modified 
BiFC and linear expression cassette (LEC), we develop a simple and rapid method 
(LEC-BiFC) for protein interaction analysis that is demonstrated by a case study 
of the interaction between Bcl-X(L) and Bak BH3 peptide. The total analysis 
procedure can be completed in two days for screening tens of mutants. LEC-BiFC 
can be applied easily in any lab equipped with a fluorescence microscope.
