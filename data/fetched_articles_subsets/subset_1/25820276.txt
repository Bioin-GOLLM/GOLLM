Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and is a focus for 
developing targeted therapies due to its refractory nature to current treatment. 
We identified a RNA helicase, DDX3, which is overexpressed in many cancer types 
including lung cancer and is associated with lower survival in lung cancer 
patients. We designed a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor, RK-33, which 
binds to DDX3 and abrogates its activity. Inhibition of DDX3 by RK-33 caused G1 
cell cycle arrest, induced apoptosis, and promoted radiation sensitization in 
DDX3-overexpressing cells. Importantly, RK-33 in combination with radiation 
induced tumor regression in multiple mouse models of lung cancer. 
Mechanistically, loss of DDX3 function either by shRNA or by RK-33 impaired Wnt 
signaling through disruption of the DDX3-β-catenin axis and inhibited 
non-homologous end joining-the major DNA repair pathway in mammalian somatic 
cells. Overall, inhibition of DDX3 by RK-33 promotes tumor regression, thus 
providing a compelling argument to develop DDX3 inhibitors for lung cancer 
therapy.
