Annett's right-shift theory proposes that human cerebral dominance (the 
functional and anatomical asymmetry or torque along the antero-posterior axis) 
and handedness are determined by a single "right-shift" gene. Familial 
transmission of handedness and specific deviations of cerebral dominance in sex 
chromosome aneuploidies implicate a locus within an X-Y homologous region of the 
sex chromosomes. The Xq21.3/Yp11.2 human-specific region of homology includes 
the protocadherin 11X/Y (PCDH11X/Y) gene pair, which encode cell adhesion 
molecules subject to accelerated evolution following the separation of the human 
and chimpanzee lineages six million years ago. PCDH11X and PCDH11Y, 
differentially regulated by retinoic acid, are highly expressed in the 
ventricular zone, subplate, and cortical plate of the developing cerebral 
cortex. Both proteins interact with β-catenin, a protein that plays a role in 
determining axis formation and regulating cortical size. In this way, the 
PCDH11X/Y gene pair determines cerebral asymmetry by initiating the right shift 
in Homo sapiens.
