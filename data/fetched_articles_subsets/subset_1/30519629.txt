INTRODUCTION: The user experience and clinical effectiveness with wearable 
global positioning system (GPS) devices for persons with dementia (PwDs) and 
caregivers (CGs) remain unclear although many are available.
METHODS: Using a crossover design, 20 dyads tested two similar commercial GPS 
watches (products A and B) at home for 4 weeks each. Usability, product 
functions, design features and product satisfaction at home and the clinic were 
investigated. Caregiver burden and quality of life assessed clinical 
effectiveness.
RESULTS: The final 17 dyads rated the usability, telephone function, overall 
design features, font, buttons, and battery life of B significantly better than 
A. PwDs rated the overall design features and buttons of A significantly better 
than CGs. Product satisfaction with both products was significantly lower at 
home. Clinical effectiveness was not found.
DISCUSSION: User experience can be improved by optimizing specific product 
details. This might translate to clinical effectiveness. Social desirability 
bias may explain different product satisfaction ratings.
