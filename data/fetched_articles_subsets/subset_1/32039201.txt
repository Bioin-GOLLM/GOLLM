Renal fibrosis is a common pathological process where certain primary or 
secondary kidney diseases can continue to progress to the end-stage of the 
kidney disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying renal fibrosis 
remain unclear. Recently, research focusing on examining the function of 
inflammasomes has attracted a great deal of attention, and data derived from 
these research projects have increased our understanding of the effects and 
regulation of inflammasomes during renal fibrosis. Based on this, the present 
review summarizes recent findings in regard to NLRP3 inflammasome functions 
during various kidney diseases, and these findings indicate that the NLRP3 
inflammasome not only mediates the inflammatory response but is also associated 
with pyroptosis, mitochondrial regulation, and myofibroblast differentiation 
during renal fibrosis. These novel findings provide us with a more in-depth 
understanding of the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and will aid in the 
identification of new targets that can be used for the prevention and treatment 
of this disease.
