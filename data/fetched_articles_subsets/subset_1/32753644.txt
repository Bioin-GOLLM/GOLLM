Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction manifesting as cholestasis is common during 
multiple organ failure. Three hepatocytic dysfunctions are considered as major 
hallmarks of cholestasis in sepsis: impairments of microvilli covering 
canalicular membranes, disruptions of tight junctions sealing bile-collecting 
canaliculae and disruptions of Mrp2-mediated hepatobiliary transport. PI3Kγ 
loss-of-function was suggested as beneficial in early sepsis. Yet, the 
PI3Kγ-regulated cellular processes in hepatocytes remained largely unclear. We 
analysed all three sepsis hallmarks for responsiveness to massive PI3K/Akt 
signalling and PI3Kγ loss-of-function, respectively. Surprisingly, neither 
microvilli nor tight junctions were strongly modulated, as shown by electron 
microscopical studies of mouse liver samples. Instead, quantitative electron 
microscopy proved that solely Mrp2 surface availability, i.e. the third 
hallmark, responded strongly to PI3K/Akt signalling. Mrp2 plasma membrane levels 
were massively reduced upon PI3K/Akt signalling. Importantly, Mrp2 levels at the 
plasma membrane of PI3Kγ KO hepatocytes remained unaffected upon PI3K/Akt 
signalling stimulation. The effect explicitly relied on PI3Kγ's enzymatic 
ability, as shown by PI3Kγ kinase-dead mice. Keeping the surface availability of 
the biliary transporter Mrp2 therefore is a cell biological process that may 
underlie the observation that PI3Kγ loss-of-function protects from hepatic 
excretory dysfunction during early sepsis and Mrp2 should thus take center stage 
in pharmacological interventions.
