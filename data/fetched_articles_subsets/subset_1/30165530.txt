Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of post-transcriptional 
regulators that often act at the heart of large networks. Hundreds of sRNAs have 
been discovered by genome-wide screens and most of these sRNAs exert their 
functions by base-pairing with target mRNAs. However, studies addressing the 
molecular roles of sRNAs have been largely confined to gamma-proteobacteria, 
such as Escherichia coli. Here we identify and characterize a novel sRNA, ChvR, 
from the alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Transcription of chvR is 
controlled by the conserved two-component system ChvI-ChvG and it is expressed 
in response to DNA damage, low pH, and growth in minimal medium. Transient 
over-expression of ChvR in combination with genome-wide transcriptome profiling 
identified the mRNA of the TonB-dependent receptor ChvT as the sole target of 
ChvR. Genetic and biochemical analyses showed that ChvR represses ChvT at the 
post-transcriptional level through direct base-pairing. Fine-mapping of the 
ChvR-chvT interaction revealed the requirement of two distinct base-pairing 
sites for full target regulation. Finally, we show that ChvR-controlled 
repression of chvT is independent of the ubiquitous RNA-chaperone Hfq, and 
therefore distinct from previously reported mechanisms employed by prototypical 
bacterial sRNAs. These findings have implications for the mechanism and 
evolution of sRNA function across bacterial species.
