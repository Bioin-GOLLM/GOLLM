DNA damage repair (DDR) is mediated by phosphorylating effectors ATM kinase, 
CHK2, p53, and γH2AX. We showed earlier that GH suppresses DDR by suppressing 
pATM, resulting in DNA damage accumulation. Here, we show GH acting through GH 
receptor (GHR) inducing wild-type p53-inducible phosphatase 1 (WIP1), which 
dephosphorylated ATM and its effectors in normal human colon cells and 
three-dimensional human intestinal organoids. Mice bearing GH-secreting 
xenografts exhibited induced colon WIP1 with suppressed pATM and γH2AX. WIP1 was 
also induced in buffy coats derived from patients with elevated GH from 
somatotroph adenomas. In contrast, decreased colon WIP1 was observed in GHR-/- 
mice. WIP1 inhibition restored ATM phosphorylation and reversed GH-induced DNA 
damage. We elucidated a novel GH signaling pathway activating Src/AMPK to 
trigger HIPK2 nuclear-cytoplasmic relocation and suppressing WIP1 
ubiquitination. Concordantly, blocking either AMPK or Src abolished GH-induced 
WIP1. We identify WIP1 as a specific target for GH-mediated epithelial DNA 
damage accumulation.
