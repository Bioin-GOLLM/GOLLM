BACKGROUND: Many biological processes are context-dependent or temporally 
specific. As a result, relationships between molecular constituents evolve 
across time and environments. While cutting-edge machine learning techniques can 
recover these networks, exploring and interpreting the rewiring behavior is 
challenging. Information visualization shines in this type of exploratory 
analysis, motivating the development ofTVNViewer 
(http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/tvnviewer), a visualization tool for dynamic network 
analysis.
RESULTS: In this paper, we demonstrate visualization techniques for dynamic 
network analysis by using TVNViewer to analyze yeast cell cycle and breast 
cancer progression datasets.
CONCLUSIONS: TVNViewer is a powerful new visualization tool for the analysis of 
biological networks that change across time or space.
