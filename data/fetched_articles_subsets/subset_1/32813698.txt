Dysregulation of ribosome production can lead to a number of developmental 
disorders called ribosomopathies. Despite the ubiquitous requirement for these 
cellular machines used in protein synthesis, ribosomopathies manifest in a 
tissue-specific manner, with many affecting the development of the face. Here we 
reveal yet another connection between craniofacial development and making 
ribosomes through the protein Paired Box 9 (PAX9). PAX9 functions as an RNA 
Polymerase II transcription factor to regulate the expression of proteins 
required for craniofacial and tooth development in humans. We now expand this 
function of PAX9 by demonstrating that PAX9 acts outside of the cell nucleolus 
to regulate the levels of proteins critical for building the small subunit of 
the ribosome. This function of PAX9 is conserved to the organism Xenopus 
tropicalis, an established model for human ribosomopathies. Depletion of pax9 
leads to craniofacial defects due to abnormalities in neural crest development, 
a result consistent with that found for depletion of other ribosome biogenesis 
factors. This work highlights an unexpected layer of how the making of ribosomes 
is regulated in human cells and during embryonic development.
