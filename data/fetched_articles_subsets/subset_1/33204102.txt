PURPOSE: To investigate the donor chimerism changes and curative effects 
associated with the use of autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
T cells with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) presenting with a low 
donor chimerism level and relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (allo-HSCT).
METHODS: Nine patients with B-ALL showing low donor chimerism level and relapse 
after allo-HSCT were enrolled. Patients 1-3 received CD19 CAR-T cell therapy 
using cells derived from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
(comprising a mixture of patient and original donor cells) as their donors could 
not provide PBMCs. Samples from the other six patients (Patients A-F) were 
investigated only in vitro. The changes in the degree of donor chimerism, 
function of the CD19 CAR-T cells and T cells in all nine patients were analyzed 
in vitro. The therapeutic effects and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated 
in Patients 1-3.
RESULTS: The CAR-T cells and T cells in all nine patients showed complete donor 
chimerism restoration following a 12-day culture period in vitro. These CD19 
CAR-T cells demonstrated strong cytotoxicity towards Nalm 6 cells in vitro 
except in patients 3 and D. In the latter patients, the absolute numbers of all 
subsets, especially the CD8 + T-cell absolute numbers in peripheral blood were 
very low. Patients 3 and D showed relatively short durations from transplant to 
recurrence and received chemotherapy after relapse. In the patients receiving 
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, the most commonly observed AE was grade 1 to 2 cytokine 
release syndrome. None of the cases showed acute graft-versus-host disease 
during treatment. Patients 1 and 2 achieved complete response with complete 
restoration of donor chimerism. Patient 3, who received the same CD19 CAR-T cell 
therapy, did not respond to this therapy.
CONCLUSION: CD19 CAR-T cells derived from patients relapsed after allo-HSCT with 
a low level of donor chimerism were effective for salvage therapy and could 
restore to complete donor chimerism after 12 days' culture in vitro.
