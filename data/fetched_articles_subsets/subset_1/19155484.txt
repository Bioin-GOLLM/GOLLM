Differentiation and clonal expansion of Ag-activated naive T cells play a 
pivotal role in the adaptive immune response. T cell Ig mucin (Tim) proteins 
influence the activation and differentiation of T cells. Tim-3 and Tim-2 clearly 
regulate Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively, but the precise influence of Tim-1 
on T cell activation remains to be determined. We now show that Tim-1 
stimulation in vivo and in vitro induces polyclonal activation of T cells 
despite absence of a conventional TCR-dependent signal 1. In this model, 
Tim-1-induced proliferation is dependent on strong signal 2 costimulation 
provided by mature dendritic cells. Ligation of Tim-1 upon CD4(+) T cells with 
an agonist anti-Tim-1 mAb elicits a rise in free cytosolic calcium, 
calcineurin-dependent nuclear translocation of NF-AT, and transcription of IL-2. 
Because Tim-4, the Tim-1 ligand, is expressed by mature dendritic cells, we 
propose that interaction between Tim-1(+) T cells and Tim-4(+) dendritic cells 
might ensure optimal stimulation of T cells, when TCR-derived signals 
originating within an inflamed environment are weak or waning.
