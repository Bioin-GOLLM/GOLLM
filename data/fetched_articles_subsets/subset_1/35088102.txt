In this retrospective cohort study, men and women with eating disorders 
(n = 8867) had higher risk of injurious falls and hip fractures than age, sex, 
and county-matched controls (n = 88670).
INTRODUCTION: Eating disorders have been associated with decreased bone mineral 
density and increased fracture risk, but the association with fall injuries 
without fracture has not previously been investigated. Furthermore, fracture 
risk in men with eating disorders has been insufficiently studied.
METHODS: In the present study, 8867 patients (9.4% men) with a diagnosed eating 
disorders and 88670 age-, sex-, and county-matched controls were investigated.
RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of the patients and controls was 41.6 
(13.7) years and the follow-up time 9.6 (5.2, 14.4) years (median, interquartile 
range) for patients and 10.1 (5.5, 14.2) years for controls. The proportions of 
injurious falls without fracture (17.3% vs. 9.0%) and of hip fracture (1.6% vs. 
0.7%) were substantially greater in patients with an eating disorder than in 
their corresponding population controls. In an unadjusted Cox proportional 
hazards model, individuals with an eating disorder had a higher risk of 
injurious falls without fracture (Hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 2.07 (1.96-2.18), and hip fracture (HR 2.30 (1.92-2.75)) than the risk 
observed in the controls. The HR for any investigated outcome associated with an 
eating disorder did not differ by sex or age (interaction term p > 0.10). The 
risk of injurious falls without fracture and hip fracture was increased in both 
women (HR 2.07 (1.95-2.19) and HR 2.41 (1.98-2.93), respectively) and men (HR 
2.09 (1.76-2.49) and HR 1.84(1.12-3.02), respectively), with an eating disorder.
CONCLUSION: The risk of injurious falls without fracture and of hip fracture is 
increased in both women and men with eating disorders, indicating measures to 
prevent both falls and fractures are important in these patients, regardless of 
age and sex.
