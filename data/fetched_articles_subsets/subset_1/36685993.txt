OBJECTIVE: Auto-inflammatory diseases (AIDs) result from mutations in genes of 
the innate immune system leading to periodic multisystemic inflammation. We 
aimed to describe the clinical, biological and molecular features (when 
available) and outcomes of Moroccan patients with AIDs.
METHODS: Patient data were collected retrospectively and analysed over a 13-year 
period.
RESULTS: Among 30 patients, 60% had FMF, 16% mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) 
and 24% other AIDs. The mean age at first consultation was 6.9 years, and the 
mean diagnostic delay was 3 years. Consanguinity was reported in 16 cases. IgA 
vasculitis was associated with 33% of FMF patients, in whom the main clinical 
features were fever (88.8%), abdominal pain (100%), arthralgias (88.8%) and 
arthritis (50%), and the most frequent mutation was M694V (66%). All FMF 
patients were treated with colchicine. Most MKD patients were confirmed by 
elevated urinary mevalonic acid levels, and four of five MKD patients received 
targeted therapy. Chronic recurrent osteomyelitis patients were confirmed by 
radiological and histological analysis. Two cases of Marshall syndrome were 
diagnosed according to validated criteria. A case of familial pustular psoriasis 
was diagnosed based on histological analysis and a patient with Muckle-Wells 
syndrome by clinical features. The outcome was favourable in 76%, partial in 
13%, and three deaths were reported.
CONCLUSION: FMF and MKD are the most reported diseases. AIDs are probably 
underestimated because they are unknown to clinicians. The aim of this work is 
to raise awareness among paediatricians about AIDs and create a network for best 
practice.
