B cells are selected for an intermediate level of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) 
signalling strength: attenuation below minimum (for example, non-functional BCR) 
or hyperactivation above maximum (for example, self-reactive BCR) thresholds of 
signalling strength causes negative selection. In ∼25% of cases, acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells carry the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase 
(Philadelphia chromosome positive), which mimics constitutively active pre-BCR 
signalling. Current therapeutic approaches are largely focused on the 
development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to suppress oncogenic 
signalling below a minimum threshold for survival. We tested the hypothesis that 
targeted hyperactivation--above a maximum threshold--will engage a deletional 
checkpoint for removal of self-reactive B cells and selectively kill ALL cells. 
Here we find, by testing various components of proximal pre-BCR signalling in 
mouse BCR-ABL1 cells, that an incremental increase of Syk tyrosine kinase 
activity was required and sufficient to induce cell death. Hyperactive Syk was 
functionally equivalent to acute activation of a self-reactive BCR on ALL cells. 
Despite oncogenic transformation, this basic mechanism of negative selection was 
still functional in ALL cells. Unlike normal pre-B cells, patient-derived ALL 
cells express the inhibitory receptors PECAM1, CD300A and LAIR1 at high levels. 
Genetic studies revealed that Pecam1, Cd300a and Lair1 are critical to calibrate 
oncogenic signalling strength through recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatases 
Ptpn6 (ref. 7) and Inpp5d (ref. 8). Using a novel small-molecule inhibitor of 
INPP5D (also known as SHIP1), we demonstrated that pharmacological 
hyperactivation of SYK and engagement of negative B-cell selection represents a 
promising new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.
