Cisplatin (CDDP) is an effective and widely used cancer chemotherapy drug. High 
mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2 have been shown to bind with high affinity 
to CDDP-DNA. In this study we analyzed the interaction of HMG proteins with 
CDDP-DNA. We demonstrate that after binding, HMG proteins can be removed from 
CDDP-DNA leaving the Pt adducts intact and capable of rebinding HMG proteins. 
Furthermore, the very HMG proteins that have been removed remain functionally 
viable and capable of rebinding CDDP-DNA. We also investigated the role that Cys 
residues play in protein binding. Replacement of Cys 45 or Cys 106 with a Ser 
residue reduced HMG2 protein binding to CDDP-DNA. These results indicate that 
Cys residues play a critical role in the high affinity binding of this protein 
to CDDP-DNA. From these findings, we speculate that the intracellular oxidative 
environment could affect the redox state of protein thiols in HMG1 and HMG2 and 
in addition, regulate the ability of these proteins to recognize cis-Pt-DNA 
adduct formation in tumor cells.
