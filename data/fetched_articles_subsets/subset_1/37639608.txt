Memory formation and forgetting unnecessary memory must be balanced for adaptive 
animal behavior. While cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling via dopamine neurons induces 
memory formation, here we report that cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) 
signaling via dopamine neurons launches forgetting of unconsolidated memory in 
Drosophila. Genetic screening and proteomic analyses showed that neural 
activation induces the complex formation of a histone H3K9 demethylase, Kdm4B, 
and a GMP synthetase, Bur, which is necessary and sufficient for forgetting 
unconsolidated memory. Kdm4B/Bur is activated by phosphorylation through 
NO-dependent cGMP signaling via dopamine neurons, inducing gene expression, 
including kek2 encoding a presynaptic protein. Accordingly, Kdm4B/Bur activation 
induced presynaptic changes. Our data demonstrate a link between cGMP signaling 
and synapses via gene expression in forgetting, suggesting that the opposing 
functions of memory are orchestrated by distinct signaling via dopamine neurons, 
which affects synaptic integrity and thus balances animal behavior.
