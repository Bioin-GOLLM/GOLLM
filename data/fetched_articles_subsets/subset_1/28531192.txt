Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by selective loss of motor neurons with inclusions frequently 
containing the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43. Using a yeast model of ALS 
exhibiting TDP-43 dependent toxicity, we now show that TDP-43 overexpression 
dramatically alters cell shape and reduces ubiquitin dependent proteolysis of a 
reporter construct. Furthermore, we show that an excess of the Hsp40 chaperone, 
Sis1, reduced TDP-43's effect on toxicity, cell shape and proteolysis. The 
strength of these effects was influenced by the presence of the endogenous yeast 
prion, [PIN+]. Although overexpression of Sis1 altered the TDP-43 aggregation 
pattern, we did not detect physical association of Sis1 with TDP-43, suggesting 
the possibility of indirect effects on TDP-43 aggregation. Furthermore, 
overexpression of the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, relieves TDP-43 mediated 
toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons, suggesting that Sis1 and its 
homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
