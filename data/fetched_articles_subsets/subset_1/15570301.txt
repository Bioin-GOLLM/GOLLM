We herein report a 34-year-old man who was investigated for severe abdominal 
pain. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and mesenteric vein thrombosis (MVT) were 
diagnosed. An association with two predisposing factors for thrombosis was 
noted: (1) heterozygous factor II 20210G/A mutation and (2) homozygous 
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C/T mutation with 
hyperhomocysteinemia. Our case is of particular interest because the patient 
reported herein, is homozygote for the MTHFR 677C/T mutation, while the only two 
other cases reported in the literature with similar gene mutations, were 
heterozygotes for the mutation.
