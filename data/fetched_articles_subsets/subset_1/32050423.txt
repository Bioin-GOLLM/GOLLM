The goal of the present study is to identify the differential expression of 
circular RNA (circRNA), miRNA, and piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) after lineage 
commitment towards osteo- and chondrogenesis of human bone marrow mesenchymal 
stromal cells (hMSCs). The cells were maintained for 7 days in either osteogenic 
or chondrogenic medium. RNA sequencing was performed to assess the expression of 
miRNA and piRNA, while RNA hybridization arrays were used to identify which 
circRNA were differentially expressed. qPCR validation of a selection of targets 
for both osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation was carried out. The 
differential expression of several circRNA, miRNA, and piRNA was identified and 
validated. The expression of total and circular isoforms of FKBP5 was 
upregulated both in osteo- and chondrogenesis and it was influenced by the 
presence of dexamethasone. ZEB1, FADS2, and SMYD3 were also identified as 
regulated in differentiation and/or by dexamethasone. In conclusion, we have 
identified a set of different non-coding RNAs that are differentially regulated 
in early osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, paving the way for further 
investigation to understand how dexamethasone controls the expression of those 
genes and what their function is in MSC differentiation.
