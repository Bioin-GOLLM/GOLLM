PURPOSE: We investigated the association of genetic factors with primary open 
angle glaucoma (POAG), including high tension glaucoma (HTG) and normal tension 
glaucoma (NTG), in a Han Chinese population.
METHODS: We recruited 1157 POAG cases, including 860 HTG and 297 NTG, and 934 
normal controls. A total of 13 previously reported single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) located at four gene regions (TMCO1, CDKN2B-AS1, ATOH7, and 
SIX1/SIX6) was genotyped. Distributions of allele frequencies were compared 
between cases and controls as well as in the HTG and NTG subgroups. The IOP, 
vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR), central corneal thickness (CCT), axial length 
(AL), and age at diagnosis also were investigated as quantitative phenotypes 
with genotypes of these SNPs.
RESULTS: The SNPs rs4656461 and rs7555523 at TMCO1, rs523096 and rs2157719 at 
CDKN2B-AS1, as well as rs33912345 and rs10483727 at SIX1/SIX6 showed 
statistically significant association with POAG. The SNPs at ATOH7 did not show 
statistically significant association with POAG in our dataset. In the subgroup 
analysis of HTG and NTG, multiple variants at CDKN2B-AS1 and SIX1/SIX6 showed 
stronger association with NTG than HTG. The SNPs rs523096 and rs2157719 at 
CDKN2B-AS1 as well as rs33912345 and rs10483727 at SIX1/SIX6 were found to be 
associated with IOP where the minor alleles were associated with an increase in 
IOP. In contrast, SNPs at TMCO1 showed significant association with HTG only.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in CDKN2B-AS1, SIX1/SIX6, and TMCO1 were 
associated with POAG in a Han Chinese population. Genes CDKN2B-AS1 and SIX1/SIX6 
seem to harbor a tendency toward POAG with lower IOP, while carriers of risk 
alleles at TMCO1 seem to be predisposed to developing POAG with higher IOP.
