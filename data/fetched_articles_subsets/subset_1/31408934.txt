Recent findings have revealed the role of membrane traffic in the signaling of 
transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). These findings originate from the pivotal 
function of TGF-β in development, cell proliferation, tumor metastasis, and many 
other processes essential in malignancy. Actin and unconventional myosin have 
crucial roles in subcellular trafficking of receptors; research has also 
revealed a growing number of unconventional myosins that have crucial roles in 
TGF-β signaling. Unconventional myosins modulate the spatial organization of 
endocytic trafficking and tether membranes or transport them along the actin 
cytoskeletons. Current models do not fully explain how membrane traffic forms a 
bridge between TGF-β and the downstream effectors that produce its functional 
responsiveness, such as cell migration. In this review, we present a brief 
overview of the current knowledge of the TGF-β signaling pathway and the 
molecular components that comprise the core pathway as follows: ligands, 
receptors, and Smad mediators. Second, we highlight key role(s) of myosin 
motor-mediated protein trafficking and membrane domain segregation in the 
modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Finally, we review future challenges 
and provide future prospects in this field.
