ABCG5 and ABCG8 are two key adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) 
proteins that regulate whole-body sterol trafficking. This study aimed to 
elucidate the association between ABCG5/G8 gene region variants and lipid 
profile, cardiometabolic traits, and gallstone disease history in Taiwan. A 
total of 1494 Taiwan Biobank participants with whole-genome sequencing data and 
117,679 participants with Axiom Genome-Wide CHB Array data were enrolled for 
analysis. Using genotype-phenotype and stepwise linear regression analyses, we 
found independent associations of four Asian-specific ABCG5 variants, 
rs119480069, rs199984328, rs560839317, and rs748096191, with total, low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL), and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 
(all p â‰¤ 0.0002). Four other variants, which were in nearly complete linkage 
disequilibrium, exhibited genome-wide significant associations with gallstone 
disease history, and the ABCG8 rs11887534 variant showed a trend of superiority 
for gallstone disease history in a nested logistic regression model (p = 0.074). 
Through regional association analysis of various other cardiometabolic traits, 
two variants of the PLEKHH2, approximately 50 kb from the ABCG5/G8 region, 
exhibited significant associations with blood pressure status (p < 10-6). In 
conclusion, differential effects of ABCG5/G8 region variants were noted for 
lipid profile, blood pressure status, and gallstone disease history in Taiwan. 
These results indicate the crucial role of individualized assessment of ABCG5/G8 
variants for different cardiometabolic phenotypes.
