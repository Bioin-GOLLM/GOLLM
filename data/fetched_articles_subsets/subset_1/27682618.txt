RATIONALE: Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) accumulation is a hallmark of 
atherosclerosis and vascular injury. However, fundamental aspects of 
proliferation and the phenotypic changes within individual VSMCs, which underlie 
vascular disease, remain unresolved. In particular, it is not known whether all 
VSMCs proliferate and display plasticity or whether individual cells can switch 
to multiple phenotypes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether proliferation and plasticity in disease is a 
general characteristic of VSMCs or a feature of a subset of cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using multicolor lineage labeling, we demonstrate that 
VSMCs in injury-induced neointimal lesions and in atherosclerotic plaques are 
oligoclonal, derived from few expanding cells. Lineage tracing also revealed 
that the progeny of individual VSMCs contributes to both alpha smooth muscle 
actin (aSma)-positive fibrous cap and Mac3-expressing macrophage-like plaque 
core cells. Costaining for phenotypic markers further identified a 
double-positive aSma+ Mac3+ cell population, which is specific to VSMC-derived 
plaque cells. In contrast, VSMC-derived cells generating the neointima after 
vascular injury generally retained the expression of VSMC markers and the 
upregulation of Mac3 was less pronounced. Monochromatic regions in 
atherosclerotic plaques and injury-induced neointima did not contain 
VSMC-derived cells expressing a different fluorescent reporter protein, 
suggesting that proliferation-independent VSMC migration does not make a major 
contribution to VSMC accumulation in vascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that extensive proliferation of a low proportion of 
highly plastic VSMCs results in the observed VSMC accumulation after injury and 
in atherosclerotic plaques. Therapeutic targeting of these hyperproliferating 
VSMCs might effectively reduce vascular disease without affecting vascular 
integrity.
