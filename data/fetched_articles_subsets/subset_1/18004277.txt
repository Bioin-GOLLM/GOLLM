Deregulation of ErbB signaling plays a key role in the progression of multiple 
human cancers. To help understand ErbB signaling quantitatively, in this work we 
combine traditional experiments with computational modeling, building a model 
that describes how stimulation of all four ErbB receptors with epidermal growth 
factor (EGF) and heregulin (HRG) leads to activation of two critical downstream 
proteins, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. Model analysis 
and experimental validation show that (i) ErbB2 overexpression, which occurs in 
approximately 25% of all breast cancers, transforms transient EGF-induced 
signaling into sustained signaling, (ii) HRG-induced ERK activity is much more 
robust to the ERK cascade inhibitor U0126 than EGF-induced ERK activity, and 
(iii) phosphoinositol-3 kinase is a major regulator of post-peak but not 
pre-peak EGF-induced ERK activity. Sensitivity analysis leads to the hypothesis 
that ERK activation is robust to parameter perturbation at high ligand doses, 
while Akt activation is not.
