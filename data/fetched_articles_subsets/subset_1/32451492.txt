Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized 
by obesity, mental impairment, rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly, male 
hypogonadism, and renal abnormalities. This disorder is caused by mutations in 
BBS1-21. Alstr√∂m syndrome (AS), caused solely by mutations in ALMS1, is another 
genetic obesity syndrome clinically similar to BBS. We previously conducted the 
first nationwide survey of BBS in Japan and found four patients with genetically 
definite BBS. In this study, exome analyses were performed on new patients whose 
symptoms fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for BBS. We identified one reported 
heterozygous mutation in BBS1 (p.R429*) in one patient, two novel mutations 
(p.L493R and p.H719Y) in BBS20 in a second patient, and one novel mutation 
(p.Q920*) and one reported mutation (p.R2928*) in ALMS1 in a third patient, who 
was subsequently diagnosed with AS. The first patient with BBS was previously 
considered to have digenic heterozygous mutations in BBS1 and BBS4. RT-PCR and 
long-range genomic PCR analyses identified a new heterozygous mutation in BBS1, 
the deletion of exons 10 and 11. Thus, this patient was compound heterozygous 
for mutations in BBS1. Many studies have described digenic heterozygous 
mutations in BBS. However, undetected mutations might have existed in either one 
of the mutated genes.
