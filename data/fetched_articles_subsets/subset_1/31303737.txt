INTRODUCTION: The preservation of the integrity and health of primary teeth and 
their supporting tissues is of great importance in maintaining arch length 
space, mastication, speech, and esthetics. A pulpotomy is a common therapy 
performed on a primary tooth presenting reversible pulpitis or a traumatic pulp 
exposure, allowing its conservation on the arch until its loss.
AIM: The study aims to clinically and radiographically evaluate the rates of 
success and efficacy of Biodentine™ as pulpotomy medicament exclusively on 
deciduous molars with complete roots formation (stage 2).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 75 primary molars in stage 2 of 
formation were selected to undergo pulpotomy treatment. All teeth were restored 
with a stainless-steel crown.The clinical success was evaluated at 1, 3, 6 and 
12-month intervals. The radiographic follow-up evaluations were at 6 and 12 
months. The resulting data were tabulated and statistically analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 75 teeth treated with Biodentine™, one tooth revealed 
abnormal mobility and tenderness to percussion at the end of the 1st month. PLS 
widening and the bone lesion was not seen in any of the 74 remaining cases. 
Forty teeth (54.1%) showed pulp canal obliteration (PCO), and none of the cases 
developed a draining sinus or had increased mobility. At the end of the 1-year 
follow-up, the clinical and radiographic success rates were 98.7% and 100%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Pulpotomies performed with Biodentine™ on stage 2 primary molars 
were generally very satisfactory and fulfilled all requirements, covering all 
needs. This innovative bioactive medicament seems to be a "heroic" material. The 
excellent outcomes of the present study are indicative that Biodentine™ is a 
promising biomaterial to promote pulp repair after pulpotomy in clinical 
practice.
