We analyzed 3,872 common genetic variants across the ESR1 locus (encoding 
estrogen receptor α) in 118,816 subjects from three international consortia. We 
found evidence for at least five independent causal variants, each associated 
with different phenotype sets, including estrogen receptor (ER(+) or ER(-)) and 
human ERBB2 (HER2(+) or HER2(-)) tumor subtypes, mammographic density and tumor 
grade. The best candidate causal variants for ER(-) tumors lie in four separate 
enhancer elements, and their risk alleles reduce expression of ESR1, RMND1 and 
CCDC170, whereas the risk alleles of the strongest candidates for the remaining 
independent causal variant disrupt a silencer element and putatively increase 
ESR1 and RMND1 expression.
