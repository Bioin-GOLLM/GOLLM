Non-syndromic recessive deafness (NSRD) is the most commonly encountered form of 
hereditary hearing loss. The majority of NSRD cases in the Mediterranean area 
are linked to the DFNB1 locus (the connexin 26 GJB2 gene). Unrelated NSRD 
patients issued from 68 Jordanian families, were tested for mutations of the 
GJB2 gene by sequencing. Sixteen per cent of the families tested were linked to 
the DFNB1 locus. The 35delG was the only GJB2 mutation detected in these 
families. One of these families, presenting with four affected members and not 
linked to the gene, was subjected to a genome-wide search and was found to be 
mapped to 9q34.3 with a multipoint lodscore of 3.9. One candidate gene in the 
interval, coding for the chloride intracellular channel 3, CLIC3, was tested and 
excluded. The identification of a new NSRD locus, DFNB33, in one Jordanian 
family, shows the wide genetic heterogeneity that characterizes hearing 
impairment and the genetic diversity in Middle-Eastern populations.
