Heart Failure (HF) is a cardiovascular disease with continually increasing 
morbidity and high mortality. The purpose of this study was to analyze 
nutritional status in patients diagnosed with HF with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF) and evaluate the impact of malnutrition on their prognosis. The Polish 
version of MNA form (Mini Nutritional Assessment) was used to assess the 
patients' nutritional status. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, 
exacerbation of HF, chosen echocardiographic and biochemical parameters, e.g., 
natriuretic peptides or serum albumin, were also analyzed. Among the 120 
consecutive patients, 47 (39%) had a normal nutritional status, 62 (52%) were at 
risk of malnutrition and 11 (9%) were malnourished. The patients with 
malnutrition more frequently presented with HF exacerbation in comparison to 
those with normal nutritional status (82% vs. 30% respectively, p = 0.004). 
There were no significant differences between the investigated groups as to 
natriuretic peptides; however, both the malnourished patients and those at risk 
of malnutrition tend to show higher B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and 
NT-proBNP concentrations. During the average 344 days of follow-up 19 patients 
died and 25 were hospitalized due to decompensated HF. Malnutrition or being at 
risk of malnutrition seems to be associated with both worse outcomes and 
clinical status in HFrEF patients.
