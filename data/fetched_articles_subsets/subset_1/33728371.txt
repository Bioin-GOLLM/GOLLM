INTRODUCTION: This study characterizes retinal capillary blood flow in subjects 
with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD)-causing mutations.
METHODS: Carriers of PSEN1 or APP mutations were prospectively recruited and 
split into early-stage (ES) and late-stage (LS) groups. Controls were normal 
subjects and non-carriers from the at-risk group. Capillary blood flow was 
quantified using an optical coherence tomography angiography-based measure of 
erythrocyte flux through capillary segments. Statistical analyses were adjusted 
for correlation between two eyes of the same subject.
RESULTS: ES carriers had significantly greater capillary blood flow than 
controls and LS carriers. ES and LS carriers had significantly greater capillary 
blood flow heterogeneity than controls. There was no difference between 
capillary blood flow of LS carriers and controls.
DISCUSSION: ES ADAD carriers demonstrate increased retinal capillary blood flow 
and flow heterogeneity compared to controls. These findings support the 
hypothesis that increased perfusion is a pathophysiologic feature of 
presymptomatic stages of ADAD.
