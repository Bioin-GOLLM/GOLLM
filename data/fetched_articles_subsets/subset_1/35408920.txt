Recent evidence in basic science is leading to a growing interest in the 
possible role of curcumin in treating retinal diseases. Curcumin has been 
demonstrated to be able to modulate gene transcription and reduce ganglion cell 
apoptosis, downgrade VEGF, modulate glucose levels and decrease vascular 
dysfunction. So far, the use of curcumin has been limited by poor 
bioavailability; to overcome this issue, different types of carriers have been 
used. Multiple recent studies disclosed the efficacy of using curcumin in 
treating different retinal conditions. The aim of this review is to 
comprehensively review and discuss the role of curcumin in retinal diseases from 
bench to bedside.
