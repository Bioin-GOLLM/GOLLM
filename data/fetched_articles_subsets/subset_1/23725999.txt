PURPOSE: To determine the safety of the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor 
everolimus (RAD001) administered daily with concurrent radiation and 
temozolomide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Everolimus was administered daily with concurrent 
radiation (60 Gy in 30 fractions) and temozolomide (75 mg/m(2) per day). 
Everolimus was escalated from 2.5 mg/d (dose level 1) to 5 mg/d (dose level 2) 
to 10 mg/d (dose level 3). Adjuvant temozolomide was delivered at 150 to 200 
mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5, every 28 days, for up to 12 cycles, with concurrent 
everolimus at the previously established daily dose of 10 mg/d. Dose escalation 
continued if a dose level produced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in fewer than 
3 of the first 6 evaluable patients.
RESULTS: Between October 28, 2010, and July 2, 2012, the Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group 0913 protocol initially registered a total of 35 patients, with 
25 patients successfully meeting enrollment criteria receiving the drug and 
evaluable for toxicity. Everolimus was successfully escalated to the 
predetermined maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg/d. Two of the first 6 eligible 
patients had a DLT at each dose level. DLTs included gait disturbance, febrile 
neutropenia, rash, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, hypoxia, ear pain, headache, and 
mucositis. Other common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 hypercholesterolemia and 
hypertriglyceridemia. At the time of analysis, there was 1 death reported, which 
was attributed to tumor progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral everolimus (10 mg) combined with both concurrent 
radiation and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide is well tolerated, 
with an acceptable toxicity profile. A randomized phase 2 clinical trial with 
mandatory correlative biomarker analysis is currently under way, designed to 
both determine the efficacy of this regimen and identify molecular determinants 
of response.
