About 0.8 million people die because of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection each 
year. In around 5% of infected adults, the immune system is ineffective in 
countering HBV infection, leading to chronic hepatitis B (CHB). CHB is 
associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, which can lead to patient death. 
Unfortunately, although current treatments against CHB allow control of HBV 
infection, they are unable to achieve complete eradication of the virus. 
Cytokines of the IFN family represent part of the innate immune system and are 
key players in virus elimination. IFN secretion induces the expression of 
interferon stimulated genes, producing proteins that have antiviral properties 
and that are essential to cell-autonomous immunity. IFN-α is commonly used as a 
therapeutic approach for CHB. In addition, IFN-γ has been identified as the main 
IFN family member responsible for HBV eradication during acute infection. In 
this review, we summarize the key evidence gained from cellular or animal models 
of HBV replication or infection concerning the potential anti-HBV roles of IFN-γ 
with a particular focus on some IFN-γ-inducible genes.
