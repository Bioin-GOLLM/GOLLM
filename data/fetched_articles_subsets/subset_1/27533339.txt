BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) may influence the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Due to the 
importance of the transport P-glycoprotein and methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents, we analyzed the MDR1 
rs1045642 and MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphisms and their associations with clinical 
outcomes in Mexican childhood ALL patients.
METHODS: A total of 109 patients participated in this study. The clinical 
evaluation consisted of a physical examination and a laboratory test. Genotyping 
of MDR1 rs1045642 (3435 C>T) and MTHFR rs1801133 (677 C>T) was performed by 
polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism. Statistical 
analyses were performed using SPSS 14.0. The odds ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were estimated by logistic regression.
RESULTS: Individuals who were CC homozygotes at MDR1 rs1045642 had lower risk of 
having methotrexate plasma concentrations >1 μM and leukopenia grade I (odds 
ratio [OR] = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.13-0.72 and OR = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.14-0.72, 
respectively). Patients who were CC homozygotes at MTHFR rs1801133 had a higher 
risk of developing mucositis (OR = 3.61; 95% CI = 1.42-9.14).
CONCLUSION: MDR1 rs1045642 and MTHFR rs1801133 should be considered as 
diagnostic candidates for the identification of pediatric patients with a high 
risk of suffering adverse events during ALL treatment.
