BACKGROUND: The Italian Society of Human Genetics' (SIGU) recommendations on 
genetic counseling and testing for hereditary melanoma state that clinical 
genetic testing can be offered to Italian melanoma families with at least two 
affected members.
OBJECTIVE: In the framework of a cooperative study, we sought to establish the 
frequency of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A mutations in melanoma families 
that underwent clinical genetic counseling and testing in accordance with the 
SIGU recommendations at 9 centers in different Italian regions.
METHODS: Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A testing was conducted by direct 
sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis in 
melanoma families with at least two affected members.
RESULTS: A total of 33% (68/204) of the families harbored cyclin-dependent 
kinase inhibitor 2A mutations. In the 145 families with two affected members the 
mutation frequency was 25%. Three novel mutations, L94P, A86T, and c.407dupG, 
were identified among the cases and not in 200 controls.
LIMITATIONS: We were unable to perform separate analyses for individual centers, 
as in some cases the number of families was too small.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of clinical genetic testing for melanoma to 
families with just two affected members in the same branch is justified in Italy 
in terms of the likelihood of identifying a mutation.
