High response rates in B-cell malignancies have been achieved with chimeric 
antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Emerging reports indicate a risk of 
active tuberculosis (TB) with novel immunotherapy for tumors. However, studies 
of TB in patients post CAR T-cell therapy are limited. In this case series 
study, we describe five patients with active TB post CD19/CD22 target CAR T-cell 
therapy alone or following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). One of 
the patients developed active TB within the first 30 days post CAR T-cell 
therapy, and fever was the dominant presenting symptom; extrapulmonary 
manifestations of active TB were common in the other four patients and 
manifested after the first 30 days of CAR T-cell therapy. Four of the five 
patients improved with anti-TB treatment, but one patient with isoniazid 
resistance died of central nervous system TB infection. Our study provides the 
first series report of active TB following CD19/CD22 target CAR T-cell therapy.
