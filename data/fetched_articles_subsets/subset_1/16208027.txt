This paper reports the first case of Haemophilus quentini bacteremia with 
reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and resistance to nalidixic acid 
identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. There was an S 84 L substitution in gyrA and 
an S 84 I substitution in par C. The isolate had co-resistance to ampicillin 
(beta-lactamase positive) and tetracycline mediated by the tet(B) gene.
