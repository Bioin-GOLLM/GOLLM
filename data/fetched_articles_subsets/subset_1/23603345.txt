BACKGROUND: Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme of 
the degradation of pyrimidine base, and plays a pivotal role in the 
pharmacogenetic syndrome of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Deficiency of DPD activity 
leads to severe toxicities, even death, following administration of 5-FU. 
Several studies have demonstrated that molecular defects of the 
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD) lead to the deficiency of DPD 
activity and cause this pharmacogenetic syndrome. We present the analysis of 
DPYD genotyping in untreated Caucasian patients (control group) and Caucasian 
patients with 5-FU/CAP-related grade 3/4 toxicities (toxicity group) who 
underwent a capecitabine TheraGuide 5-FU testing.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Full sequencing of DPYD was performed in the Myriad 
Genetic Laboratories, Inc. as part of TheraGuide 5-FU test.
RESULTS: Among 227 patients from the toxicity group, 27 (12%) had deleterious 
mutations in DPYD: twelve (5%) had IVS14 +1 G>A, eleven (5%) had D949V and four 
(2%) had other mutations. Only 7/192 (4%) patients from the control group had 
DPYD genotype abnormalities: two (1%) had IVS14 +1 G>A, four (2%) had D949V and 
one (1%) had other mutation. Genotype abnormalities were observed more 
frequently in the toxicity group (p=0.001). Among 65 patients with toxicities 
due to capecitabine, nine (14%) had mutated DPYD, which was more frequent than 
in the control group (p=0.006).
CONCLUSION: Mutated DPYD is frequently observed in Caucasian patients who 
experience toxicities while receiving 5-FU/capecitabine. Screening of patients 
for DPYD mutations prior to administration of 5-FU/capecitabine using new 
pharmacogenetic testing methods, may help for identify those patients who are at 
greatest risk for adverse effects, allowing a more individualized approach to 
their chemotherapy management.
