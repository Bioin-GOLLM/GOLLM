The level of body iron storage and the erythropoietic need for iron are 
indicated by the serum levels of ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor 
(sTfR), respectively. A meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies on 
sTfR and ferritin revealed novel association to the PCSK7 and TMPRSS6 loci for 
sTfR and the HFE locus for both parameters. The PCSK7 association was the most 
significant (rs236918, P = 1.1 × 10E-27) suggesting that proprotein convertase 
7, the gene product of PCSK7, may be involved in sTfR generation and/or iron 
homeostasis. Conditioning the sTfR analyses on transferrin saturation abolished 
the HFE signal and substantially diminished the TMPRSS6 signal while the PCSK7 
association was unaffected, suggesting that the former may be mediated by 
transferrin saturation whereas the PCSK7-associated effect on sTfR generation 
appears to be more direct.
