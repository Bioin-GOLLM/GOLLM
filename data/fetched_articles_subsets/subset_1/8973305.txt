We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with 
the alpha-subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, Gi2. We screened a 
human B cell cDNA library with full-length G alpha i2 and isolated four positive 
colonies, one of which expressed the 44-kDa COOH terminus of a previously 
unrecognized 677-amino acid (aa) protein. A full-length clone was isolated from 
a HeLa cell cDNA library. The deduced protein contains 10 Leu-Gly-Asn repeats, 
and thus we named it LGN. Computer analysis indicates that LGN is a mosaic 
protein with seven repeated sequences of about 40 aa in length at its N-terminal 
end, and four repeated sequences of about 34 aa at its C-terminal end. Each of 
the two repeat regions shows substantial similarity to proteins found in other 
organisms. RT-PCR analysis of human tissues showed that the mRNA of LGN was 
ubiquitously expressed. The specificity of interaction between G alpha i2 and 
LGN was confirmed by an in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. These 
data indicate that the yeast two-hybrid system can identify novel proteins, such 
as LGN, that interact with G alpha proteins. As a mosaic protein, LGN shows 
similarity with portions of proteins from many species and thus may define a new 
protein family.
