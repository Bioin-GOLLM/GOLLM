Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through the Ca2+ uniporter supports cell functions, 
including oxidative metabolism, while meeting tissue-specific calcium signaling 
patterns and energy needs. The molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific 
control of the uniporter are unknown. Here, we investigated a possible role for 
tissue-specific stoichiometry between the Ca2+-sensing regulators (MICUs) and 
pore unit (MCU) of the uniporter. Low MICU1:MCU protein ratio lowered the [Ca2+] 
threshold for Ca2+ uptake and activation of oxidative metabolism but decreased 
the cooperativity of uniporter activation in heart and skeletal muscle compared 
to liver. In MICU1-overexpressing cells, MICU1 was pulled down by MCU 
proportionally to MICU1 overexpression, suggesting that MICU1:MCU protein ratio 
directly reflected their association. Overexpressing MICU1 in the heart 
increased MICU1:MCU ratio, leading to liver-like mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake 
phenotype and cardiac contractile dysfunction. Thus, the proportion of 
MICU1-free and MICU1-associated MCU controls these tissue-specific uniporter 
phenotypes and downstream Ca2+ tuning of oxidative metabolism.
