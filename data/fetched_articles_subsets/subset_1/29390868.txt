The aim of the study was to evaluate selected angiogenic factors in patients 
with essential thrombocythemia (ET) depending on JAK2V617F, calreticulin gene 
(CALR) and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations. Sixty ET 
patients and 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. The following 
tests were performed: vascular endothelial growth factor- A (VEGF-A), soluble 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1),soluble vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2), platelet-derived growth factor( 
PDGF-BB), and stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α). We observed an increased 
PDGF-BB level in patients with ET compared to the controls. Patients with CALR 
mutation had significantly higher concentration of PDGF-BB and lower 
concentration of SDF-1α than patients with JAK2V617F mutation. High 
concentration of PDGF-BB and low concentration of SDF-1α in patients with 
CALR(+) ET may indicate a contribution of these chemokines in disturbed Ca2+ 
metabolism in platelets.
