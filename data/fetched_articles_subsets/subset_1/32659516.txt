African horse sickness (AHS) is a devastating disease caused by African horse 
sickness virus (AHSV) and transmitted by arthropods between its equine hosts. 
AHSV is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, where polyvalent live attenuated vaccine 
is in use even though it is associated with safety risks. This review article 
summarizes and compares new strategies to generate safe and effective AHSV 
vaccines based on protein, virus like particles, viral vectors and reverse 
genetics technology. Manipulating the AHSV genome to generate synthetic viruses 
by means of reverse genetic systems has led to the generation of potential safe 
vaccine candidates that are under investigation.
