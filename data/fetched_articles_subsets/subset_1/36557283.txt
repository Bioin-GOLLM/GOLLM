Diabetic retinopathy (DR), as the leading cause of vision loss in the 
working-age population, exhibits unique metabolite profiles in human plasma and 
vitreous. However, those in retina are not fully understood. Here, we utilized 
liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technology to explore 
metabolite characteristics of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice retina. 
A total of 145 metabolites differed significantly in diabetic retinas compared 
with controls. These metabolites are mainly enriched in the Warburg effect, and 
valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways. To further identify 
underlying regulators, RNA sequencing was performed to integrate metabolic 
enzyme alterations with metabolomics in STZ-induced diabetic retina. Retinol 
metabolism and tryptophan metabolism are the shared pathways enriched by 
metabolome and transcriptome. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis identified 
71 differentially expressed enzyme-related genes including Hk2, Slc7a5, Aldh1a3 
and Tph integrated with altered metabolic pathways. In addition, single 
nucleotide polymorphisms within 6 out of 71 genes are associated with increased 
diabetes risk. This study lays the foundation for mechanism research and the 
therapeutic target development of DR.
