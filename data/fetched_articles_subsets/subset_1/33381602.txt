The C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2) was evidenced to be associated with 
tuberculosis susceptibility in some ethnic groups. In the present study, effort 
was made to find out the association of CCL2-2518 A>G and -362 G>C variants with 
susceptibility to TB in a population from North India. The genotyping was 
carried out in 373 participants with pulmonary TB (PTB) and 248 healthy controls 
(HCs) for CCL2-2518 A>G and -362 G>C polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP and by melting 
curve analysis using fluorescence-labeled hybridization fluorescent resonance 
energy transfer (FRET) probes, respectively, followed by DNA sequencing in a few 
representative samples. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared by the 
chi-squared test and crude and Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) odds ratio (OR). OR was 
calculated using STATA/MP16.1 software. Further, CCL2, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
and TGF-β levels were measured in serum samples of these participants using 
commercially available kits. Our analysis indicated that the homozygous mutant 
in both -2518 GG (OR = 2.07, p = 0.02) and -362 CC (OR = 1.92, p = 0.03) 
genotypes was associated with susceptibility to pulmonary TB. Further, 
heterozygous genotypes -2518AG (OR = 0.60, p = 0.003) and -362GC (OR = 0.64, p = 
0.013) provide resistance from PTB disease. Haplotype analysis revealed AC 
haplotype (p = 0.006) to be a risk factor associated with PTB susceptibility. 
The serum CCL2 level was significantly elevated among participants with -2518 AA 
genotype compared to -2518 GG genotype. CCL2 level was observed to be positively 
correlated with IL12p70, IFN-γ and TNF-α, thus suggesting the immunological 
regulatory role of CCL2 against pulmonary tuberculosis. CCL2-2518 GG and -362 CC 
genotypes were found to be associated with susceptibility to pulmonary 
tuberculosis and CCL2-2518AG and CCL2-362GC with resistance from PTB. AC 
haplotype was found to be a risk factor for PTB in the present study. It may be 
hypothesized from the findings that -2518G allele could be responsible for lower 
production of CCL2 which leads to defective Th1 response and makes a host 
susceptible for pulmonary tuberculosis.
