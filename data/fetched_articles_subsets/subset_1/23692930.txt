Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative 
disease. ALS selectively causes degeneration in upper and lower (spinal) motor 
neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis and death by ventilatory failure. 
Although ventilatory failure is generally the cause of death in ALS, little is 
known concerning the impact of this disorder on respiratory motor neurons, the 
consequences of respiratory motor neuron cell death, or the ability of the 
respiratory control system to "fight back" via mechanisms of compensatory 
respiratory plasticity. Here we review known effects of ALS on breathing, 
including possible effects on rhythm generation, respiratory motor neurons, and 
their target organs: the respiratory muscles. We consider evidence for 
spontaneous compensatory plasticity, preserving breathing well into disease 
progression despite dramatic loss of spinal respiratory motor neurons. Finally, 
we review current and potential therapeutic approaches directed toward 
preserving the capacity to breathe in ALS patients.
