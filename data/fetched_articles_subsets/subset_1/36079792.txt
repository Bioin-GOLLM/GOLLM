Date palm fruit seed (Phoenix dactylifera L.) extract (DSE), an under-utilized 
resource, is a rich source of polyphenols with high potency for disease 
prevention and antioxidative activities. For the first time, the present study 
demonstrated that DSE inhibits labile iron activity and DNA and BSA damage and 
inhibits acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase activities. Moreover, DSE reduces 
the proliferation of hepatic, colorectal, and breast cancer cells 
dose-dependently through apoptotic mechanisms. Furthermore, DSE significantly 
suppressed the expression of both BCl-2 and P21 genes and increased the P53 
expression level when compared with the untreated cells and the 5-FU treated 
cells. These findings suggest a strong potential for DSE in protecting against 
the iron-catalyzed ferroptosis that results in programmed cell death. The 
results also confirm the efficacy of DSE against cancer cells. Therefore, DSE 
constitutes a valuable candidate for developing functional foods and for natural 
compound-based chemotherapy for the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.
