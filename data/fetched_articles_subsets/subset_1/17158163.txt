Abf1 and Rap1 are general regulatory factors (GRFs) that contribute to 
transcriptional activation of a large number of genes, as well as to 
replication, silencing and telomere structure in yeast. In spite of their 
widespread roles in transcription, the scope of their functional targets 
genome-wide has not been previously determined. Here, we use microarrays to 
examine the contribution of these essential GRFs to transcription genome-wide, 
by using ts mutants that dissociate from their binding sites at 37 degrees C. We 
then combine this data with published ChIP-chip studies and motif analysis to 
identify probable direct targets for Abf1 and Rap1. We also identify a 
substantial number of genes likely to bind Rap1 or Abf1, but not affected by 
loss of GRF binding. Interestingly, the results strongly suggest that Rap1 can 
contribute to gene activation from farther upstream than can Abf1. Also, 
consistent with previous work, more genes that bind Abf1 are unaffected by loss 
of binding than those that bind Rap1. Finally, we show for several such genes 
that the Abf1 C-terminal region, which contains the putative activation domain, 
is not needed to confer this peculiar 'memory effect' that allows continued 
transcription after loss of Abf1 binding.
