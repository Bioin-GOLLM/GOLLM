DNA sequence analysis of the gene coding for the variant protein, factor IXLong 
Beach (FIXLB), has identified a transition mutation in an otherwise normal 
factor IX (FIX) gene. Genomic DNA clones spanning 35 kilobase (kb) pairs of the 
FIXLB gene were isolated. A gene analysis strategy that specifically 
characterized exons and their flanking intron sequences predicted the entire 
amino acid sequence of FIXLB. A thymine to cytosine transition causes the 
substitution of a threonine codon (ACA) for an isoleucine codon (ATA) in exon 
VIII of the FIXLB gene. This mutation results in an amino acid substitution at 
residue 397 of the FIX zymogen and the phenotypic display of hemophilia-B. 
Previous studies revealed that activated purified FIXLB (FIXaLB) had normal 
Ca2+, phospholipid, and factor VIIIa binding characteristics. However, FIXaLB 
activated factor X or factor VII (with their cofactors Ca2+ and phospholipid) at 
significantly reduced rates, suggesting that the defect in FIXaLB lies near or 
within the catalytic triad of the FIX heavy chain. Identification of an amino 
acid substitution near the carboxy-terminus of the FIXaLB heavy chain supports 
the earlier characterization of this variant protein. Moreover, our data 
identify a residue in the catalytic domain of FIXa essential for normal 
function.
