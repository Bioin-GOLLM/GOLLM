The disease known as cerebral cavernous malformations mostly occurs in the 
central nervous system, and their typical histological presentations are 
multiple lumen formation and vascular leakage at the brain capillary level, 
resulting in disruption of the blood-brain barrier. These abnormalities result 
in severe neurological symptoms such as seizures, focal neurological deficits 
and hemorrhagic strokes. CCM research has identified 'loss of function' 
mutations of three ccm genes responsible for the disease and also complex 
regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the WNT/β-catenin pathway, 
TGF-β and Notch signaling by the ccm genes. Although CCM research is a 
relatively new and small scientific field, as CCM research has the potential to 
regulate systemic blood vessel permeability and angiogenesis including that of 
the blood-brain barrier, this field is growing rapidly. In this review, I will 
provide a brief overview of CCM pathogenesis and function of ccm genes based on 
recent progress in CCM research. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(5): 255-262].
