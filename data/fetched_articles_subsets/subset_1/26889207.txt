BACKGROUND: The incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) declined by about 40 % 
in Canada with the introduction of a national folic acid (FA) fortification 
program. Despite the fact that few Canadians currently exhibit folate 
deficiency, NTDs are still the second most common congenital abnormality. FA 
fortification may have aided in reducing the incidence of NTDs by overcoming 
abnormal one carbon metabolism cycling, the process which provides one carbon 
units for methylation of DNA. We considered that NTDs persisting in a 
folate-replete population may also occur in the context of FA-independent 
compromised one carbon metabolism, and that this might manifest as abnormal DNA 
methylation (DNAm). Second trimester human placental chorionic villi, kidney, 
spinal cord, brain, and muscle were collected from 19 control, 22 spina bifida, 
and 15 anencephalic fetuses in British Columbia, Canada. DNA was extracted, 
assessed for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype and for 
genome-wide DNAm using repetitive elements, in addition to the Illumina Infinium 
HumanMethylation450 (450k) array.
RESULTS: No difference in repetitive element DNAm was noted between NTD status 
groups. Using a false discovery rate <0.05 and average group difference in 
DNAm ≥0.05, differentially methylated array sites were identified only in (1) 
the comparison of anencephaly to controls in chorionic villi (n = 4 sites) and 
(2) the comparison of spina bifida to controls in kidney (n = 3342 sites).
CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the distinctive DNAm of spina bifida kidneys may be 
consequent to the neural tube defect or reflective of a common etiology for 
abnormal neural tube and renal development. Though there were some small shifts 
in DNAm in the other tested tissues, our data do not support the long-standing 
hypothesis of generalized altered genome-wide DNAm in NTDs. This finding may be 
related to the fact that most Canadians are not folate deficient, but it 
importantly opens the field to the investigation of other epigenetic and 
non-epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of NTDs.
