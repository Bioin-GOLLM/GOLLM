Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is characterized by focal or multifocal increase 
in bone turnover. One of the most well-established candidate genes for 
susceptibility to PDB is Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1). Mutations in SQSTM1 have been 
documented among Western-European, British and American patients with PDB. 
However, there is no information on SQSTM1 mutation status in PDB patients from 
the Central- and Eastern-European regions. In this study, we conducted a 
mutation screening for SQSTM1 gene variants in 82 PDB patients and 100 control 
participants in Hungary. Mutations of SQSTM1 were detected in 18 PDB patients 
(21.95%); associations between genotype and clinical characteristics were also 
analyzed. Altogether, six different exonic alterations, including two types of 
UTR variants in the SQSTM1 gene, were observed in our PDB patients. Similarly, 
to previous genetic studies on Paget's disease, our most commonly detected 
variant was the c.1175C > T (p.Pro392Leu) in nine cases (four in monostotic and 
five in polyostotic form). We have surveyed the germline SQSTM1 variant 
distribution among Hungarian patients with PDB. We also highlighted that the 
pattern of the analyzed disease-associated pathophysiological parameters could 
partially discriminate PDB patients with normal or mutant SQSTM1 genotype. 
However, our findings also underline and strengthen that not solely SQSTM1 
stands in the background of the complex PDB etiology.
