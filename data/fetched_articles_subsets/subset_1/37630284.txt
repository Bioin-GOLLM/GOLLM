The first single crystal structure of the homoleptic copper (II) ML2 complex 
(M=Cu (II), L = curcumin) was obtained and its structure was elucidated by X-ray 
diffraction showing a square planar geometry, also confirmed by EPR. The 
supramolecular arrangement is supported by C-H···O interactions and the solvent 
(MeOH) plays an important role in stabilizing the crystal packing Crystallinity 
was additionally assessed by XRD patterns. The log P value of the complex (2.3 ± 
0.15) was determined showing the improvement in water solubility. The cytotoxic 
activity of the complex against six cancer cell lines substantially surpasses 
that of curcumin itself, and it is particularly selective against leukemia 
(K562) and human glioblastoma (U251) cell lines, with similar antioxidant 
activity to BHT. This constitutes the first crystal structure of pristine 
curcumin complexed with a metal ion.
