Previous studies have demonstrated that culture supernatants of LPS-stimulated 
murine splenic B lymphocytes (BLPSSN) are able to inhibit the growth of freshly 
isolated B cells via an IgM antibody. In this work we investigated the progress 
of LPS-activated B lymphocytes through the cell cycle in the presence of this 
antibody. We found that the regulatory IgM did not affect the entry of 
LPS-stimulated B lymphocytes into G0*, as assessed by the increased expression 
of I-A antigens. Events that characterize the early G1 phase (G1A), such as cell 
enlargement and increased RNA synthesis, also occurred in the presence of the 
antibody. In contrast, events which mark the G1B phase, such as further cell 
enlargement and late RNA synthesis were inhibited. Moreover, a significant 
portion of the cells failed to incorporate [3H]thymidine and did not progress 
through S, G2, or M, as revealed by their DNA content. Therefore, our work 
points toward a well-defined stage of the early G1 phase at which the antibody 
inhibits the progression of B lymphocyte activation. This result shows a new 
insight into the mechanism of antibody-mediated down-regulation of polyclonal B 
cell responses.
