BACKGROUND: Inadequate trophoblast invasion and the subsequent inflammatory 
response have been implicated in preeclampsia (PE) pathogenesis. Because 
MYC-induced nuclear antigen (MINA) gene expression is involved in cell 
proliferation and differentiation, inflammatory response modulation, and the 
unpaired regulation of which is associated with human diseases, we sought to 
investigate the connection between MINA and PE.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible relationship 
between the MINA rs4857304 variant and susceptibility to PE development as well 
as to estimate placental MINA gene expression and its association with PE.
METHODS: About 242 pregnant women (126 PE cases and 116 controls) were included. 
MINA genotyping and gene expression were evaluated by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan probes.
RESULTS: The G/G genotype of the MINA rs4857304 variant was associated with 
severe PE (p = 0.027, OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.8-3.2). Carriers of one G allele of 
the MINA rs4857304 variant exhibited a 1.7-fold increased risk of severe PE (p = 
0.029, 95% CI = 1.1-3.0). MINA was underexpressed in preeclamptic placentas and 
MINA expression differed between the mild and severe PE groups. Differences in 
the expression levels of MINA were found among women with the T/T genotype of 
the rs4857304 polymorphism and carriers of at least one G allele (p = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: PE and its severity are associated with the underexpression of 
placental MINA, and the G/G genotype of the MINA rs4857304 variant may modify 
the risk of severe PE among the PE cases evaluated.
