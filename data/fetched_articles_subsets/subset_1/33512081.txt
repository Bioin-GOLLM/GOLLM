BACKGROUND: Human soluble epoxide hydrolase plays a major role in cardiovascular 
homoeostasis. Genetic variants in the EPHX2 gene among different ethnic groups 
are associated with cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension. However, 
no reports regarding the association of EPHX2 genotype with hypertension among 
type II diabetic (T2D) patients of Middle Eastern Jordanian origin exist.
OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to elucidate the association of the EPHX2 
allele, genotype and haplotype with T2D, hypertension and parameters of lipid 
profile parameters among Jordanian T2D patients.
METHODS: Ninety-three genomic DNA samples of non-diabetic controls and 97 
samples from T2D patients were genotyped for EPHX2 rs4149243, rs2234914 and 
rs751142 genetic variants. The DNA samples were amplified using polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and then sequenced using Applied Biosystems Model (ABI3730x1). 
The functionality of intronic EPHX2 variants was predicted using the in silico 
Berkely Drosophila Genome Project software.
RESULTS: We found no significant (P >.05) association between the EPHX2 
rs4149243, rs2234914 and rs751142 allele, genotype and haplotype and the 
incidence of T2D and hypertension. Additionally, no association (P >.05) between 
these EPHX2 genetic variants with the baseline total cholesterol, low- and 
high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides among both non-diabetic and diabetic 
volunteers was found. However, we found an inter-ethnic variation (χ2 -test, P 
value ˂ .05) in the allele frequency of the EPHX2 rs4149243 and rs2234914 
variants between Jordanians and other ethnic populations. Also, the in silico 
Berkely Drosophila Genome Project software predicted that the intronic EPHX2 
rs4149243 could alter the splicing of intron 7.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded from this study that EPHX2 rs4149243, rs2234914 
and rs751142 genetic variants do not play a role in the development of T2D and 
hypertension among Jordanian T2D patients. Further genetic studies with larger 
sample sizes are needed to find out the association of other functional EPHX2 
variants with cardiovascular diseases among T2D patients in Jordan.
