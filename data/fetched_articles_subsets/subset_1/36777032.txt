INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), one of the deadliest human 
pathogen, has evolved with different strategies of survival inside the host, 
leading to a chronic state of infection. Phagosomally residing Mtb encounters a 
variety of stresses, including increasing acidic pH. To better understand the 
host-pathogen interaction, it is imperative to identify the role of various 
genes involved in the survivability of Mtb during acidic pH environment.
METHODS: Bio-informatic and enzymatic analysis were used to identify Mtb gene, 
Rv3338, as epoxide hydrolase. Subsequently, CRISPRi knockdown strategy was used 
to decipher its role for Mtb survival during acidic stress, nutrient starvation 
and inside macrophages. Confocal microscopy was used to analyse its role in 
subverting phagosomal acidification within macrophage.
RESULTS: The present work describes the characterization of Rv3338 which was 
previously known to be associated with the aprABC locus induced while 
encountering acidic stress within the macrophage. Bio-informatic analysis 
demonstrated its similarity to epoxide hydrolase, which was confirmed by 
enzymatic assays, thus, renamed EphH. Subsequently, we have deciphered its 
indispensable role for Mtb in protection from acidic stress by using the CRISPRi 
knockdown strategy. Our data demonstrated the pH dependent role of EphH for the 
survival of Mtb during nutrient starvation and in conferring resistance against 
elevated endogenous ROS levels during stress environment.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an EH of 
Mtb as a crucial protein for bacterial fitness inside the host, a phenomenon 
central to its pathogenesis.
