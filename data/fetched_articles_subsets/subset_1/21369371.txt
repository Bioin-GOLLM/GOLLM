Human tumor suppressor gene RIZ encodes two protein products, tumor suppressor 
RIZ1 and proto-oncoprotein RIZ2, which regulate cellular functions in a Yin-Yang 
fashion. The only structural difference between them is that RIZ2 lacks the 
N-terminal PR domain. In this study, we showed that RIZ1 mRNA expression level 
was elevated in stage IV of eight different types of cancer (stage III for 
prostate cancer), indicating that RIZ1 might play an important role in tumor 
metastasis, and the PR domain alone possessed anticancer activity.
