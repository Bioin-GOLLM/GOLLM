OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A tracheal cartilaginous sleeve (TCS) is a rare anomaly 
characterized by anterior fusion of tracheal cartilages. TCS is associated with 
syndromic craniosynostoses including Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes and 
FGFR2, FGFR3, and TWIST1 variants. This study presents a 30-year review of 
patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS and describes diagnostic 
methods, genetic variants, surgical interventions, and long-term outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, single-institution review.
METHODS: This review included patients with syndromic craniosynostosis and TCS 
treated at Seattle Children's Hospital from 1990 to 2020. Tracheostomy, genetic 
variants, and additional surgery were primary measures. Fisher's exact test 
compared need for tracheostomy in patients with proposed high-risk (FGFR2 p.W290 
or FGFR2 p.C342) versus low-risk genetic variants.
RESULTS: Thirty patients with TCS were identified. Average age at diagnosis was 
12 months (range 2-weeks to 7.9-years; standard deviation 19.8 months). 
Syndromes included Pfeiffer (37%), Apert (37%), and Crouzon (26%). Severe 
obstructive sleep apnea was present in 76% of patients. Tracheostomy was 
performed in 17 patients (57%); five were successfully decannulated. Additional 
interventions included adenotonsillectomy (57%), nasal (20%), laryngeal (17%), 
and craniofacial skeletal surgery (87%). All patients with Pfeiffer syndrome and 
FGFR2 p.W290C variants and 83% of patients with FGFR2 p.C342 variants required 
tracheostomy, differing from other variants (P = .02, odds ratio 33, 95% 
confidence interval 1.56-697.96). One patient (3%) died.
CONCLUSION: TCS contributes to multilevel airway obstruction in patients with 
syndromic craniosynostosis. Genetic testing in patients with FGFR2-related 
syndromic craniosynostoses may identify those at risk of TCS and facilitate 
early intervention. A better understanding of this patient population may foster 
individualized airway management strategies and improve outcomes.
