Mitochondria are responsible for ATP production but are also known as regulators 
of cell death, and mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ is a key modulator of both ATP 
production and cell death. Although mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and efflux have 
been studied for over 50 years, it is only in the past decade that the proteins 
responsible for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and efflux have been identified. The 
identification of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) led to an explosion of 
studies identifying regulators of the MCU. The levels of these regulators vary 
in a tissue- and disease-specific manner, providing new insight into how 
mitochondrial Ca2+ is regulated. This review focuses on the proteins responsible 
for mitochondrial transport and what we have learned from mouse studies with 
genetic alterations in these proteins.
