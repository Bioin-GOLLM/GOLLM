Abnormal beta-hexosaminidase alpha chain mRNAs from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient 
with the classical infantile Tay-Sachs disease contained intact or truncated 
intron 12 sequences. Sequence analysis showed a single nucleotide transversion 
at the 5' donor site of intron 12 from the normal G to C. This provides the 
first evidence that this junctional mutation, also found independently in two 
other laboratories by analysis of genomic clones, results in functional 
abnormality. Analysis with normal and mutant oligonucleotides as probes 
indicated that our patient was a compound heterozygote with only one allele 
having the transversion. The patient studied in the other two laboratories was 
also a compound heterozygote. Another Ashkenazi Jewish patient was normal in 
this region in both alleles. Thus, the splicing defect is the underlying genetic 
cause in some but not all Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Tay-Sachs disease.
