Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the 
deposition of misfolded aggregates of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ). Aβ(1-42) is 
one of the most aggregation-prone components in senile plaques of AD patients. 
We demonstrated that relatively homogeneous Aβ(1-42) fibrils with one 
predominant fold visible in solid-state NMR spectra can be obtained at acidic 
pH. The structure of these fibrils differs remarkably from some other polymorphs 
obtained at neutral pH. In particular, the entire N-terminal region is part of 
the rigid fibril core. Here, we investigate the effects of a pH shift on the 
stability and the fold of these fibrils at higher pH values. Fibril bundling at 
neutral pH values renders cryo-EM studies impractical, but solid-state NMR 
spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biophysical methods provide 
residue-specific structural information under these conditions. The LS-fold of 
the Aβ(1-42) fibrils does not change over the complete pH range from pH 2 to pH 
7; in particular, the N-terminus remains part of the fibril core. We observe 
changes in the protonation state of charged residues starting from pH 5 on a 
residue-specific level. The deprotonation of the C-terminal carboxyl group of 
A42 in the intermolecular salt bridge with D1 and K28 is slow on the NMR time 
scale, with a local pKa of 5.4, and local conformations of the involved residues 
are affected by deprotonation of A42. Thus, we demonstrate that this fibril form 
is stable at physiological pH values.
