Recently, novel drugs like venetoclax plus 5-azacytidine (VA) were reported to 
have promising efficacy in refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, 
there are still some cases presented with novel drugs resistance, and its 
genetics composition and clinical phenotype are urging to study. We described a 
58-year-old patient who was resistant to intensive chemotherapy. This refractory 
AML was presented with the persistence of RUNX1, IDH1 and DNMT3A mutations. 
RUNX1 mutations disappeared and leukemia cutis ensued after multiple 
chemotherapies. Leukemia cutis exhibited NRAS mutations in addition to IDH1 and 
DNMT3A mutations. With the VA salvage treatment, platelets were recovered to the 
normal level and blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood were moderately 
controlled. However, leukemia cutis did not resolve. Unexpectedly, BM blasts 
obtained the new NRAS mutations after VA treatment, and consequently experienced 
leukostasis with two distinct leukemia clones. After survival of 230â€‰days, this 
patient died because of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage. This case highlights 
presentation of leukemia cutis with simultaneous mutations of IDH1, DNMT3A and 
NRAS in AML patients might act as a resistant niche to avoid the toxicity of 
multiple drugs including VA. There is unmet need to validate this result in the 
clinical trials or a large cohort of patients in the future.
