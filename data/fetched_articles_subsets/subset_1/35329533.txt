This paper presents the tribological properties of silicon and oxygen 
incorporated diamond-like carbon coatings tested in simulated body fluid and 
bovine serum albumin environments. The tests were performed using a ball-on-disc 
tribometer with an AISI316L steel counterbody. The wear tracks and wear scars 
were analyzed using optical microscopy and a nanoindenter. The interaction 
between the coating and the working environment was analyzed by Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy, whereas changes in the chemical structure 
before and after the tribological tests were compared with the use of Raman 
spectroscopy. Our study showed that the tribological parameters are governed by 
the presence of oxygen rather than the changing concentration of silicon. Both 
of the spectroscopy results confirm this statement, indicating that coatings 
with low concentrations of silicon and oxygen appear to be better candidates for 
biological applications in terms of wear resistance.
