Septic shock is a frequent life-threatening condition and a leading cause of 
mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Previous investigations have reported 
a potentially protective effect of obesity in septic shock patients. However, 
prior results have been inconsistent, focused on short-term in-hospital 
mortality and inadequately adjusted for confounders, and they have rarely 
applied the currently valid Sepsis-3 definition criteria for septic shock. This 
investigation examined the effect of obesity on 90-day mortality in patients 
with septic shock selected from a prospectively enrolled cohort of septic 
patients. A total of 352 patients who met the Sepsis-3 criteria for septic shock 
were enrolled in this study. Body-mass index (BMI) was used to divide the cohort 
into 24% obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and 76% non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m2) patients. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significantly lower 90-day mortality 
(31% vs. 43%; p = 0.0436) in obese patients compared to non-obese patients. 
Additional analyses of baseline characteristics, disease severity, and 
microbiological findings outlined further statistically significant differences 
among the groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis estimated a significant 
protective effect of obesity on 90-day mortality after adjustment for 
confounders. An understanding of the underlying physiologic mechanisms may 
improve therapeutic strategies and patient prognosis.
