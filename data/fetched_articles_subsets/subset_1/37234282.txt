Two new species from Grande Terre Island, New Caledonia, namely 
Fasciamiruspetersorumsp. nov. and Simulacalararasp. nov. are described based on 
larval morphology and molecular data (COI sequences). Fasciamiruspetersorumsp. 
nov. is distributed in the southern part of the island and is characterised by a 
reduced third segment of the labial palps and all abdominal gills divided from 
the base. The species inhabits slow-flowing aquatic habitats with fine-grained 
substrate in forest brooks. Simulacalararasp. nov. is known from a single 
locality in the northern part of the island and is characterised by narrow and 
distinctly elongated abdominal gills 1-7. It was collected from fine substrates 
behind stones in riffles with slightly turbulent flow. Both species were 
recorded only in areas with ultramafic bedrock.
