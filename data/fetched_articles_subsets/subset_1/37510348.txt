Glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis defect 15 is a rare autosomal 
recessive disorder due to biallelic loss of function of GPAA1. At the moment, 
less than twenty patients have been reported, usually compound heterozygous for 
GPAA1 variants. The main clinical features are intellectual disability, 
hypotonia, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy. We describe a 4-year-old male with 
a novel, homozygous variant. The patient presents with typical features, such as 
developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and atypical features, such as 
macrocephaly, preauricular, and cheek appendages. When he was 15 months, the 
cerebellum was normal. When he was 33 months old, after the molecular diagnosis, 
magnetic resonance imaging was repeated, showing cerebellar atrophy. This case 
extends the clinical spectrum of the GPAA1-related disorder and helps to 
delineate phenotypic differences with defects of other subunits of the 
transamidase complex.
