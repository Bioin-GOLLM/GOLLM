Germline mutations in BRAF and other components of the MAPK pathway are 
associated with the congenital syndromes collectively known as RASopathies. 
Here, we report the association of Septo-Optic Dysplasia (SOD) including 
hypopituitarism and Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous (CFC) syndrome in patients harbouring 
mutations in BRAF. Phosphoproteomic analyses demonstrate that these genetic 
variants are gain-of-function mutations leading to activation of the MAPK 
pathway. Activation of the MAPK pathway by conditional expression of the 
BrafV600E/+ allele, or the knock-in BrafQ241R/+ allele (corresponding to the 
most frequent human CFC-causing mutation, BRAF p.Q257R), leads to abnormal cell 
lineage determination and terminal differentiation of hormone-producing cells, 
causing hypopituitarism. Expression of the BrafV600E/+ allele in embryonic 
pituitary progenitors leads to an increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors, 
cell growth arrest and apoptosis, but not tumour formation. Our findings show a 
critical role of BRAF in hypothalamo-pituitary-axis development both in mouse 
and human and implicate mutations found in RASopathies as a cause of endocrine 
deficiencies in humans.
