Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs), which arise due to oxidative stress, are 
proinflammatory and proatherogenic, but their roles in non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) are unknown. Here, we show that OxPLs accumulate in human 
and mouse NASH. Using a transgenic mouse that expresses a functional 
single-chain variable fragment of E06, a natural antibody that neutralizes 
OxPLs, we demonstrate the causal role of OxPLs in NASH. Targeting OxPLs in 
hyperlipidemic Ldlr-/- mice improved multiple aspects of NASH, including 
steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, hepatocyte death, and progression to 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Mechanistically, we found that OxPLs promote ROS 
accumulation to induce mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes. Neutralizing 
OxPLs in AMLN-diet-fed Ldlr-/- mice reduced oxidative stress, improved hepatic 
and adipose-tissue mitochondrial function, and fatty-acid oxidation. These 
results suggest targeting OxPLs may be an effective therapeutic strategy for 
NASH.
