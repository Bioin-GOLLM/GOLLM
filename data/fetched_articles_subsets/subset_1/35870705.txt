BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome influences host physiology and cardiometabolic 
diseases by interacting directly with intestinal cells or by producing molecules 
that enter the host circulation. Given the large number of microbial species 
present in the gut and the numerous factors that influence gut bacterial 
composition, it has been challenging to understand the underlying biological 
mechanisms that modulate risk of cardiometabolic disease.
SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: Here we discuss a systems-based approach that involves 
simultaneously examining individuals in populations for gut microbiome 
composition, molecular traits using "omics" technologies, such as circulating 
metabolites quantified by mass spectrometry, and clinical traits. We summarize 
findings from landmark studies using this approach and discuss future 
applications.
MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Population-based integrative approaches have identified a 
large number of microbe-derived or microbe-modified metabolites that are 
associated with cardiometabolic traits. The knowledge gained from these studies 
provide new opportunities for understanding the mechanisms involved in gut 
microbiome-host interactions and may have potentially important implications for 
developing novel therapeutic approaches.
