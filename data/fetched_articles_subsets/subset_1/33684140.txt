OBJECTIVES: The burden of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 
insertion mutation (Exon 20ins) in non-small cell lung cancer is not well 
understood. A systematic review was conducted to identify evidence on mutation 
frequency, prognostic impact, clinical, patient-reported, and economic outcomes 
associated with Exon 20ins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches were conducted in Embase and Medline and 
supplemented with recent conference proceedings. Included studies were not 
limited by intervention, geography, or publication year.
RESULTS: Seventy-eight unique studies were included; 53 reporting mutation 
frequency, 13 prognostic impact, 36 clinical outcomes, and one humanistic 
burden. No economic burden data were identified. The frequency of Exon 20ins 
mutation ranged from 0.1% to 4% of all NSCLC cases and 1% to 12% of all EGFR 
mutations. Data on the prognostic impact of Exon 20ins were heterogeneous but 
highlighted poorer outcomes in patients with Exon 20ins mutation compared with 
patients with other EGFR mutations and EGFR wildtype across a wide range of 
therapies and treatment lines. Comparative evidence on the clinical efficacy and 
safety of currently available therapies were limited, as were sample sizes of 
studies reporting on real-world effectiveness. Nine single-arm trials and 27 
observational studies reported clinical outcomes for patients with Exon 20ins. 
Trends towards better survival and response were observed for chemotherapy 
compared with TKIs as first-line treatments. For subsequent treatment lines, 
novel targeted therapies provided encouraging preliminary responses while 
results for chemotherapy were less favorable. Limited safety data were reported. 
One conference abstract described the symptom burden for Exon 20ins patients 
with fatigue and pain being most common.
CONCLUSION: Findings of the systematic review show a high unmet need for safe 
and efficacious treatments for patients with Exon 20ins as well and need for 
further evidence generation to better understand the patient-level and economic 
impact for these patients.
