BACKGROUND: Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (PNST) are a diverse group of mostly 
benign tumours uncommon in the general population. About 5-10% of PNSTs are 
hereditary, predominantly arising from germline variants in NF1, NF2, SMARCB1, 
or LZTR1 gene.
METHODS: We reviewed the clinical characteristics and genetic testing results of 
patients referred to the NCIS Adult Cancer Genetics Clinic for suspected 
hereditary PNST.
RESULTS: 3,001 patients suspected to have various hereditary cancer syndromes 
were evaluated between year 2000 to March 2021. 13 (0.4%) were clinically 
diagnosed to have hereditary PNSTs. The majority were male (54%), with a median 
age at presentation to the genetics clinic of 29 years (range 19-48). 11/13 
(85%) patients had multiple PNSTs, 12/13 (92%) had young onset PNSTs, 5/13 
(38.5%) had personal and family history of PNST. 11/13 patients (85%) had 
clinical features of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) including one patient who 
also fulfilled clinical criteria of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2); 2/13 (14%) 
had multiple schwannomas. Four patients underwent multi-gene panel testing, 
including one patient with clinical NF1, one patient who met both clinical NF1 
and NF2 criteria, and two patients with multiple schwannomas. The patient with 
clinical features of NF1 was heterozygous for a pathogenic c. 2033dup variant in 
the NF1 gene. The patient with both NF1/NF2 features was heterozygous for a 
novel c.732 T > A nonsense variant in the NF2 gene. The two patients with 
multiple schwannomas were heterozygous for a pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
variant in the LZTR1 gene and are the first LZTR1-positive schwannomatosis 
patients reported in Asia.
CONCLUSION: Hereditary PNSTs are rare referrals to an adult cancer genetics 
clinic. NF1 is the most common PNST seen. LZTR1 variants may be the underlying 
cause in Asian patients with multiple schwannomatosis.
