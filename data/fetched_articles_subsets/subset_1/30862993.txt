The liver has a high regenerative capacity after acute liver injury, but this is 
often impaired during chronic liver injury. The existence of a dedicated liver 
stem cell population that acts as a source of regeneration during chronic liver 
injury has been controversial. Recent advances in transgenic models and cellular 
reprogramming have provided new insights into the plasticity of the liver 
epithelium and directions for the development of future therapies. This article 
will highlight recent findings about the cellular source of regeneration during 
liver injury and the advances in promoting liver regeneration.
