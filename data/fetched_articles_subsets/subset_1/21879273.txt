BACKGROUND: Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is implicated in 
carcinogenesis. In this study we examined the expression of ICAM-1 in papillary 
thyroid cancer (PTC). We hypothesized that ICAM-1 correlates with indicators of 
tumor aggressiveness in PTC.
METHODS: Thirty-five primary and metastatic PTCs, five follicular adenomas, five 
Hashimoto thyroiditis, five nodular hyperplasia, and eight normal thyroid tissue 
samples were analyzed for ICAM-1 gene expression using quantitative 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ICAM-1 gene expression 
was analyzed at protein level by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a 
semiquantitative score. Gene expression and intensity levels were correlated 
with markers of tumor aggressiveness including BRAF V600E mutation, tumor size, 
extrathyroidal extension (ETE), angiolymphatic invasion, and lymph node 
metastasis.
RESULTS: ICAM-1 gene expression was higher in PTC (p = 0.01) and lymph node 
metastases (p = 0.03) when compared with benign tumors and Hashimoto's. 
Furthermore, PTCs exhibiting BRAF V600E mutation (p = 0.01), ETE (p < 0.01), and 
lymph node metastasis (p = 0.02) were associated with higher ICAM-1 levels. Gene 
expression correlated with protein levels on IHC. Additionally, poorly 
differentiated thyroid carcinoma had a higher ICAM-1 intensity score compared 
with well-differentiated carcinoma (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: ICAM-1 expression is upregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma. 
Furthermore, ICAM-1 upregulation correlated with aggressive tumor features such 
as BRAF V600E mutation, ETE, and lymph node metastasis, suggesting that ICAM-1 
plays a role in thyroid cancer progression.
