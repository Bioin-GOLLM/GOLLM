PURPOSE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease 
characterized by an extensive fibroinflammatory stroma, which includes abundant 
cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) populations. PDAC CAFs are heterogeneous, but 
the nature of this heterogeneity is incompletely understood. The Hedgehog 
pathway functions in PDAC in a paracrine manner, with ligands secreted by cancer 
cells signaling to stromal cells in the microenvironment. Previous reports 
investigating the role of Hedgehog signaling in PDAC have been contradictory, 
with Hedgehog signaling alternately proposed to promote or restrict tumor 
growth. In light of the newly discovered CAF heterogeneity, we investigated how 
Hedgehog pathway inhibition reprograms the PDAC microenvironment.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used a combination of pharmacologic inhibition, gain- 
and loss-of-function genetic experiments, cytometry by time-of-flight, and 
single-cell RNA sequencing to study the roles of Hedgehog signaling in PDAC.
RESULTS: We found that Hedgehog signaling is uniquely activated in fibroblasts 
and differentially elevated in myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAF) compared with 
inflammatory CAFs (iCAF). Sonic Hedgehog overexpression promotes tumor growth, 
while Hedgehog pathway inhibition with the smoothened antagonist, LDE225, 
impairs tumor growth. Furthermore, Hedgehog pathway inhibition reduces myCAF 
numbers and increases iCAF numbers, which correlates with a decrease in 
cytotoxic T cells and an expansion in regulatory T cells, consistent with 
increased immunosuppression.
CONCLUSIONS: Hedgehog pathway inhibition alters fibroblast composition and 
immune infiltration in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment.
