The functional interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is 
challenging due to the cell-type-dependent influences of genetic variants. Here, 
we generated comprehensive maps of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) 
for 659 microdissected human kidney samples and identified cell-type-eQTLs by 
mapping interactions between cell type abundances and genotypes. By partitioning 
heritability using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression to 
integrate GWAS with single-cell RNA sequencing and single-nucleus assay for 
transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing data, we 
prioritized proximal tubules for kidney function and endothelial cells and 
distal tubule segments for blood pressure pathogenesis. Bayesian colocalization 
analysis nominated more than 200 genes for kidney function and hypertension. Our 
study clarifies the mechanism of commonly used antihypertensive and 
renal-protective drugs and identifies drug repurposing opportunities for kidney 
disease.
