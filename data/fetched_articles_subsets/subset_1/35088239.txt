Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is a type of functional kinase with primary functions of 
participating in cell mitosis, which has been identified to be involved in the 
occurrence and development of malignant tumors strongly. However, it still 
remains a controversial with respect to the relationship between the 
phosphorylation level of AURKB and its function. In our initial research, there 
was no significant difference in the relative content of AURKB protein between 
drug-resistant breast cancer cells and wild-type cells; however, its 
phosphorylation level in drug-resistant cells was significantly higher than that 
in wild-type cells. Subsequent cell and animal experiments both confirmed the 
positive correlation between AURKB phosphorylation and drug resistance. 
Furthermore, PRKCE in the upstream was identified to regulate the 
phosphorylation of AURKB, which promoted the change of spatial localization of 
AURKB from nucleus to cytoplasm. Accordingly, phosphorylated AURKB reduced the 
negative regulation of downstream RAB27B transcription physically, and 
interacted with RAB27B in cytoplasm to maintain its protein stability. 
Eventually, it promoted exosome secretion of drug-resistant cells and drug 
efflux. Using shRNA to knockdown AURKB expression, using hesperadin to inhibit 
AURKB activity, mutating the AURKB phosphorylation site, or using siRNA as well 
as BIM to inhibit the activity of the upstream AURKB phosphorylation regulatory 
protein PRKCE, all of which directly or indirectly reduce AURKB phosphorylation, 
are effective in reversing PTX resistance in cells. Collectively, this study 
provides experimental evidence for PRKCE/AURKB/RAB27B axis in regulating the 
resistance to paclitaxel (PTX) in breast cancer cells, offering a potential 
intervention target for reversing drug resistance.
