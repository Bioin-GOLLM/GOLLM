Targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis may offer an 
alternative therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma. Fenretinide and 
bortezomib induce apoptosis of melanoma cells but their efficacy may be hindered 
by the unfolded protein response, which promotes survival by ameliorating 
endoplasmic reticulum stress. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis 
that inhibition of GRP78, a vital unfolded protein response mediator, increases 
cell death in combination with endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agents. 
Down-regulation of GRP78 by small-interfering RNA increased fenretinide- or 
bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Treatment of cells with a GRP78-specific subtilase 
toxin produced a synergistic enhancement with fenretinide or bortezomib. These 
data suggest that combining endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agents with 
strategies to down-regulate GRP78, or other components of the unfolded protein 
response, may represent a novel therapeutic approach for metastatic melanoma.
