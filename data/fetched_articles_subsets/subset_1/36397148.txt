BACKGROUND: Poor infiltration of functioning T cells renders tumors unresponsive 
to checkpoint-blocking immunotherapies. Here, we identified a combinatorial in 
situ immunomodulation strategy based on the administration of selected 
immunogenic drugs and immunotherapy to sensitize poorly T-cell-infiltrated 
neuroblastoma (NB) to the host antitumor immune response.
METHODS: 975A2 and 9464D NB cell lines derived from spontaneous tumors of 
TH-MYCN transgenic mice were employed to study drug combinations able of 
enhancing the antitumor immune response using in vivo and ex vivo approaches. 
Migration of immune cells towards drug-treated murine-derived organotypic tumor 
spheroids (MDOTS) were assessed by microfluidic devices. Activation status of 
immune cells co-cultured with drug-treated MDOTS was evaluated by flow cytometry 
analysis. The effect of drug treatment on the immune content of subcutaneous or 
orthotopic tumors was comprehensively analyzed by flow-cytometry, 
immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence. The chemokine array assay 
was used to detect soluble factors released into the tumor microenvironment. 
Patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) were generated from human NB 
specimens. Migration and activation status of autologous immune cells to 
drug-treated PDOTS were performed.
RESULTS: We found that treatment with low-doses of mitoxantrone (MTX) recalled 
immune cells and promoted CD8+ T and NK cell activation in MDOTS when combined 
with TGFβ and PD-1 blockade. This combined immunotherapy strategy curbed NB 
growth resulting in the enrichment of a variety of both lymphoid and myeloid 
immune cells, especially intratumoral dendritic cells (DC) and IFNγ- and 
granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells and NK cells. A concomitant production of 
inflammatory chemokines involved in remodelling the tumor immune landscape was 
also detected. Interestingly, this treatment induced immune cell recruitment 
against PDOTS and activation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with low-dose of MTX and anti-TGFβ treatment 
with PD-1 blockade improves antitumor immunity by remodelling the tumor immune 
landscape and overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of aggressive 
NB.
