BACKGROUND: CYP2C19*17 (rs12248560) is a functional single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) in the CYP2C19 gene. It has been shown that CYP2C19*17 is 
associated with the clinical outcome of some drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 and a 
decreased risk of some diseases. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable 
and simple method to detect this polymorphism.
METHODS: Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain 
reaction (T-ARMS-PCR) was used to detect the CYP2C19*17 polymorphism. A total of 
93 samples were screened by this method, and the results of T-ARMS-PCR were 
validated by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: There were 91 samples with the CC genotype (97.8%) and two samples with 
the CT genotype (2.2%). The frequency of the C allele was 98.9%, and the 
frequency of the T allele was 1.1%. The DNA sequencing results were completely 
concordant with the T-ARMS-PCR results.
CONCLUSION: T-ARMS-PCR can detect the CYP2C19*17 polymorphism with high 
accuracy, low costs, and a simple process.
