Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterised by heritable risk that is not well 
understood. Heritable, genetic variation at 11q23.1 is associated with increased 
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, demonstrating eQTL effects on 3 cis- and 23 
trans-eQTL targets. We sought to determine the relationship between 11q23.1 cis- 
and trans-eQTL target expression and test for potential cell-specificity. 
scRNAseq from 32,361 healthy colonic epithelial cells was aggregated and subject 
to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). One module (blue) 
included 19 trans-eQTL targets and was correlated with POU2AF2 expression only. 
Following unsupervised clustering of single cells, the expression of 19 
trans-eQTL targets was greatest and most variable in cluster number 11, which 
transcriptionally resembled tuft cells. 14 trans-eQTL targets were found to 
demarcate this cluster, 11 of which were corroborated in a second dataset. 
Intra-cluster WGCNA and module preservation analysis then identified twelve 
11q23.1 trans-eQTL targets to comprise a network that was specific to cluster 
11. Finally, linear modelling and differential abundance testing showed 11q23.1 
trans-eQTL target expression was predictive of cluster 11 abundance. Our 
findings suggest 11q23.1 trans-eQTL targets comprise a POU2AF2-related network 
that is likely tuft cell-specific and reduced expression of these genes 
correlates with reduced tuft cell abundance in silico.
