Maternal RNA degradation is critical for embryogenesis and is tightly controlled 
by maternal RNA-binding proteins. Fragile X mental-retardation protein (FMR1) 
binds target mRNAs to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes/granules that 
control various biological processes, including early embryogenesis. However, 
how FMR1 recognizes target mRNAs and how FMR1-RNP granule assembly/disassembly 
regulates FMR1-associated mRNAs remain elusive. Here we show that Drosophila 
FMR1 preferentially binds mRNAs containing m6A-marked "AGACU" motif with high 
affinity to contributes to maternal RNA degradation. The high-affinity binding 
largely depends on a hydrophobic network within FMR1 KH2 domain. Importantly, 
this binding greatly induces FMR1 granule condensation to efficiently recruit 
unmodified mRNAs. The degradation of maternal mRNAs then causes granule 
de-condensation, allowing normal embryogenesis. Our findings reveal that 
sequence-specific mRNAs instruct FMR1-RNP granules to undergo a dynamic 
phase-switch, thus contributes to maternal mRNA decay. This mechanism may 
represent a general principle that regulated RNP-granules control RNA processing 
and normal development.
