Neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) is expressed by sensory cells in the 
cochlea and is necessary for proper cochlear innervation and sensory domain 
patterning during development.

BACKGROUND: In the cochlea, auditory development depends on precise patterns of 
innervation by afferent and efferent nerve fibers, as well as a stereotyped 
arrangement of hair and supporting cells. Neuronal cell adhesion molecule 
(NrCAM) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that controls diverse aspects of 
nervous system development, but the function of NrCAM in cochlear development is 
not well understood.
RESULTS: Throughout cochlear innervation, NrCAM is detectable on spiral ganglion 
neuron (SGN) afferent and olivocochlear efferent fibers, and on the membranes of 
developing hair and supporting cells. Neonatal Nrcam-null cochleae show errors 
in type II SGN fasciculation, reduced efferent innervation, and defects in the 
stereotyped packing of hair and supporting cells. Nrcam loss also leads to 
dramatic changes in the profiles of presynaptic afferent and efferent synaptic 
markers at the time of hearing onset. Despite these numerous developmental 
defects, Nrcam-null adults do not show defects in auditory acuity, and by 
postnatal day 21, the developmental deficits in ribbon synapse distribution and 
sensory domain structure appear to have been corrected.
CONCLUSIONS: NrCAM is expressed by several neural and sensory epithelial 
subtypes within the developing cochlea, and the loss of Nrcam confers numerous, 
but nonpermanent, developmental defects in innervation and sensory domain 
patterning. Developmental Dynamics 247:934-950, 2018. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals,
