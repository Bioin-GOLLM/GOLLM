The global circulation of newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 is a new threat 
to public health due to their increased transmissibility and immune evasion. 
Moreover, currently available vaccines and therapeutic antibodies were shown to 
be less effective against new variants, in particular, the South African (SA) 
variant, termed 501Y.V2 or B.1.351. To assess the efficacy of the CT-P59 
monoclonal antibody against the SA variant, we sought to perform as in vitro 
binding and neutralization assays, and in vivo animal studies. CT-P59 
neutralized B.1.1.7 variant to a similar extent as to wild type virus. CT-P59 
showed reduced binding affinity against a RBD (receptor binding domain) triple 
mutant containing mutations defining B.1.351 (K417N/E484K/N501Y) also showed 
reduced potency against the SA variant in live virus and pseudovirus 
neutralization assay systems. However, in vivo ferret challenge studies 
demonstrated that a therapeutic dosage of CT-P59 was able to decrease B.1.351 
viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, comparable to that 
observed for the wild type virus. Overall, although CT-P59 showed reduced 
in vitro neutralizing activity against the SA variant, sufficient antiviral 
effect in B.1.351-infected animals was confirmed with a clinical dosage of 
CT-P59, suggesting that CT-P59 has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients 
infected with SA variant.
