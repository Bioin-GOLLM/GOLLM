As the cost of DNA sequencing decreases, association studies based on whole 
genome sequencing are now becoming feasible. It is still unclear, however, how 
much more we could gain from whole genome sequencing compared to exome 
sequencing, which has been widely used to study a variety of diseases. In this 
project, we performed a comparison between whole genome sequencing and exome 
sequencing for family-based association analysis using data from Genetic 
Analysis Workshop 18. Whole genome sequencing was able to identify several 
significant hits within intergenic regions. However, the increased cost of 
multiple testing counteracted the benefits and resulted in a higher false 
discovery rate. Our results suggest that exome sequencing is a cost-effective 
way to identify disease-related variants. With the decreasing sequencing cost 
and accumulating knowledge of the human genome, whole genome sequencing has the 
potential to identify important variants in regulatory regions typically 
inaccessible for exome sequencing.
