Calpains are ubiquitous pro-inflammatory proteases, whose activity is controlled 
by calpastatin, their specific inhibitor. Transgenic mice over-expressing rabbit 
calpastatin (CalpTG) are protected against vascular remodelling and angiotensin 
II-dependent inflammation. We hypothesized that specific calpain inhibition 
would protect against aging-related lesions in arteries and kidneys. We analysed 
tissues from 2-months and 2-years-old CalpTG and wild-type mice and performed 
high throughput RNA-Sequencing of kidney tissue in aged mice. In addition, we 
analysed inflammatory response in the kidney of aged CalpTG and wild-type mice, 
and in both in vivo (monosodium urate peritonitis) and in vitro models of 
inflammation. At two years, CalpTG mice had preserved kidney tissue, less 
vascular remodelling and less markers of senescence than wild-type mice. 
Nevertheless, CalpTG mice lifespan was not extended, due to the development of 
lethal spleen tumors. Inflammatory pathways were less expressed in aged CalpTG 
mice, especially cytokines related to NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 
CalpTG mice had reduced macrophage infiltration with aging and CalpTG mice 
produced less IL-1α and IL-1β in vivo in response to inflammasome activators. In 
vitro, macrophages from CalpTG mice produced less IL-1α in response to 
particulate activators of inflammasome. Calpains inhibition protects against 
inflammaging, limiting kidney and vascular lesions related to aging.
