We used pyrosequencing, peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-clamping polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), and real-time PCR to detect the BRAF V600E mutation and to 
investigate the prognostic effect of the BRAF V600E mutation in paraffin block 
specimens from 100 patients diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Positive 
rates of PNA-clamping PCR, real-time PCR, and pyrosequencing were 66%, 70%, and 
68%, respectively. Pyrosequencing and PNA-clamping PCR detected mutant type in a 
99:1 (wild-type: mutant) DNA concentration, and PNA-clamping PCR detected mutant 
type in a 99.5:0.5 DNA concentration. Clamping PCR showed higher Îº value than 
real-time PCR (0.729 vs 0.626). The BRAF V600E mutation was associated with an 
advanced stage of cancer (P = .045) and was found to be associated with poor 
prognostic factors. This study suggests that pyrosequencing can be as sensitive 
as real-time PCR and that PNA-clamping PCR is a sensitive and reliable method to 
detect the BRAF V600E mutation.
