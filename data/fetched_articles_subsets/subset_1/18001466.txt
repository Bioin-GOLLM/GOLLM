BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 (ET-1) both stimulates nociceptors and sensitizes them 
to noxious stimuli, an effect probably mediated by the ETA receptor (ETAR) 
expressed in sensory neurons. The cellular mechanisms of this ET-1-mediated 
effect are only poorly understood. TRPV1, the heat-, pH- and capsaicin-sensitive 
cation channel already known to be modulated by a number of cellular mediators 
released in response to noxious stimuli and during inflammation, is a potential 
target for the action of ET-1.
RESULTS: We studied the effects of ET-1 on TRPV1 in sensory neurons from the 
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and in HEK293 cells coexpressing TRPV1 and the ETAR. 
Specific 125I-ET-1 binding sites (817 +/- 92 fmol/mg) were detected in membrane 
preparations of DRG with an ETAR/ETBR ratio of 60:40. In an immunofluorescence 
analysis, coexpression of TRPV1 and the ETAR was found in a subpopulation of 
primary sensory neurons. ET-1 strongly potentiated capsaicin-induced TRPV1 
currents in some neurons, and in HEK293 cells co-expressing TRPV1 and the ETAR. 
Weaker potentiation was observed in HEK293 cells coexpressing TRPV1 and the 
ETBR. ETAR activation also increased responses to low pH and heat. In HEK293 
cells, strong potentiation of TRPV1 like that induced by ET-1 via the ETAR could 
be induced by PKC activation, but not with activators of the adenylyl cyclase or 
the PKA pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC with bisindolylmaleimide X (BIM 
X) or mutation of the PKC phosphorylation site S800 completely prevented 
ETAR-mediated potentiation.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that ET-1 potentiates TRPV1 by a PKC-dependent mechanism 
and that this could play a major role in the algogenic and hyperalgesic effects 
of ET-1 described in previous studies.
