OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether lack of Dicer during calvaria development would 
lead to dysmorphology of calvaria and suture closure in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A conditional Dicer deficient under Osx promoter mouse 
was employed in this study. The 4- and 10-week-old conditional Dicer-deficient 
mice control littermates and Osx-cre transgenic mice were studied for calvarial 
bone morphology and suture closure. Dry skull, microcomputed tomography (μCT), 
histological and gene expression studies were investigated to evaluate the 
effect of Dicer deficiency on calvarial bone morphology and their related genes 
during calvaria development.
RESULTS: The results elucidated that complete suture closure was observed in 
10-week-old conditional Dicer-deficient mice while incomplete closure suture was 
observed in age-matched Osx-cre control mice. The μCT and histological sections 
demonstrated complete fusion of posterior frontal suture and dysmorphic 
calvarial bones in Dicer deficient mice compared to the ones in their 
littermates and age-matched Osx-cre control mice. Gene expression study 
demonstrated significantly increased expression of suture and calvarial 
bone-related genes, that is Tgf-beta family, Bmp3, Msx2, Alx4, Runx2 and Osx in 
Dicer-deficient mice during suture closure time.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest mature miRNAs are important for suture closure 
and calvarial morphology during calvaria development.
