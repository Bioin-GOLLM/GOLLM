Background Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors on reducing 
hospitalization for heart failure have been reported in randomized controlled 
trials, but their effects on patients with heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the drug efficacy of 
luseogliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and HFpEF. Methods and Results We performed a 
multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial for comparing 
luseogliflozin 2.5 mg once daily with voglibose 0.2 mg 3 times daily in patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus suffering from HFpEF (left ventricular ejection 
fraction >45% and BNP [B-type natriuretic peptide] concentrations ≥35 pg/mL) in 
a 1:1 randomization fashion. The primary outcome was the difference from 
baseline in BNP levels after 12 weeks of treatment between the 2 drugs. A total 
of 173 patients with diabetes mellitus and HFpEF were included. Of these, 83 
patients were assigned to receive luseogliflozin and 82 to receive voglibose. 
There was no significant difference in the reduction in BNP concentrations after 
12 weeks from baseline between the 2 groups. The ratio of the mean BNP value at 
week 12 to the baseline value was 0.79 in the luseogliflozin group and 0.87 in 
the voglibose group (percent change, -9.0% versus -1.9%; ratio of change with 
luseogliflozin versus voglibose, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.10; P=0.26). Conclusion In 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and HFpEF, there is no significant 
difference in the degree of reduction in BNP concentrations after 12 weeks 
between luseogliflozin and voglibose. Registration URL:
