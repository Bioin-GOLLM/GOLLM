Complete eradication of HIV-1 infection is impeded by the existence of latent 
HIV-1 reservoirs in which the integrated HIV-1 provirus is transcriptionally 
inactive. Activation of HIV-1 transcription requires the viral Tat protein and 
host cell factors, including protein phosphatase-1 (PP1). We previously 
developed a library of small compounds that targeted PP1 and identified a 
compound, SMAPP1, which induced HIV-1 transcription. However, this compound has 
a limited bioavailability in vivo and may not be able to reach HIV-1-infected 
cells and induce HIV-1 transcription in patients. We packaged SMAPP1 in 
polymeric polyethylene glycol polymethyl methacrylate nanoparticles and analyzed 
its release and the effect on HIV-1 transcription in a cell culture. SMAPP1 was 
efficiently packaged in the nanoparticles and released during a 120-hr period. 
Treatment of the HIV-1-infected cells with the SMAPP1-loaded nanoparticles 
induced HIV-1 transcription. Thus, nanoparticles loaded with HIV-1-targeting 
compounds might be useful for future anti-HIV-1 therapeutics.
