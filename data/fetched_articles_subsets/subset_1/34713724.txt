Background Black Americans have more atrial fibrillation risk factors but lower 
atrial fibrillation risk than White Americans. Left atrial (LA) enlargement 
and/or dysfunction, frequent atrial tachycardia (AT), and premature atrial 
contractions (PAC) are associated with increased atrial fibrillation risk. 
Racial differences in these factors may exist that could explain the difference 
in atrial fibrillation risk. Methods and Results We included 2133 ARIC 
(Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study participants (aged 
74±4.5 years[mean±SD], 59% women, 27% Black participants) who had 
echocardiograms in 2011 to 2013 and wore the Zio XT Patch (a 2-week continuous 
heart monitor) in 2016 to 2017. Linear regression was used to analyze (1) 
differences in AT/day or PAC/hour between Black and White participants, (2) 
differences in LA measures between Black and White participants, and (3) racial 
differences in the association of LA measures with AT or PAC frequency. Compared 
with White participants, Black participants had a higher prevalence of 
cardiovascular risk factors and disease, lower AT frequency, greater LA size, 
and lower LA function. After multivariable adjustments, Black participants had 
37% (95% CI, 24%-47%) fewer AT runs/day than White participants. No difference 
in PAC between races was noted. Greater LA size and reduced LA function are 
associated with more AT and PAC runs; however, no race interaction was present. 
Conclusions Differences in LA measures are unlikely to explain the difference in 
atrial fibrillation risk between Black and White individuals. Despite more 
cardiovascular risk factors and greater atrial remodeling, Black participants 
have lower AT frequency than White participants. Future research is needed to 
elucidate the protective mechanisms that confer resilience to atrial arrhythmias 
in Black individuals.
