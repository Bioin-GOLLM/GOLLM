A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed with uveal melanoma, peritoneal mesothelioma 
and a primary biliary tract adenocarcinoma. She had a strong family history of 
mesothelioma as well as other malignancies including renal cell carcinoma. The 
recently described BAP1 hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome was suspected, 
but immunohistochemical labeling was not conclusive. Genetic testing confirmed a 
novel and unusual germline mutation in the ubiquitin hydrolase domain of the 
BAP1 gene (p.Tyr173Cys) and the patient was diagnosed with the BAP1 hereditary 
cancer predisposition syndrome. This case demonstrates the importance of 
clinically recognizing this rare syndrome and its manifestations, some which are 
still being characterized. It also highlights the importance of genetic testing 
in cases where there is a high clinical suspicion, even when screening tests, 
such as immunohistochemistry, in this case, are inconclusive. The diagnosis of a 
germline BAP1 mutation may have important implications for both the patient and 
their families with regards to further genetic testing and active surveillance 
programs. Further research is needed to fully understand the extent and clinical 
implications of this rare cancer syndrome.
