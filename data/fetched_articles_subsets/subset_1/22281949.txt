BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT) regulates a variety of visceral and physiological 
functions, including sleep. Polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A receptor gene can alter 
its transcription, affecting the number of receptors in the serotoninergic 
system, contributing to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the 102T-C 
and -1438G-A polymorphisms in the 5-HTR2A gene in Brazilian patients with and 
without OSAS.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study performed at the 
Otorhinolaryngology and Sleep Disorder Out Clinics, São José do Rio Preto 
Medical School, FAMERP. One hundred patients were examined as index cases and 
100 persons as controls, of both genders to both groups. DNA was extracted from 
peripheral blood leukocytes, and the sites that encompassed both polymorphisms 
were amplified by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: There was a significant prevalence of the male gender in index cases 
compared with the control group gender (p < 0.0001). There was no significant 
genotypic difference in the 102T-C polymorphism between the case and control 
groups (p = 1.000). The AA genotype of the -1438G-A polymorphism was more 
prevalent in the patients with OSAS compared with the controls (OR, 2.3; CI 95% 
1.20-4.38; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the prevalence of the 102T-C 
polymorphism between patients with OSAS and the control group. Serotoninergic 
system dysfunction appeared to be related to OSAS. The -1438G-A polymorphism and 
OSAS are related in this studied Brazilian population.
