An intestinal epithelium model able to produce mucus was developed to provide an 
environment suitable for testing the therapeutic activity of gut bacteriophages. 
We show that Enterococcus faecalis adheres more effectively in the presence of 
mucus, can invade the intestinal epithelia and is able to translocate after 
damaging tight junctions. Furthermore, Enterococcus phage vB_EfaM_A2 (a member 
of Herelleviridae that possesses virion associated immunoglobin domains) was 
found to translocate through the epithelium in the presence and absence of its 
host bacteria. Phage A2 protected eukaryotic cells by reducing mortality and 
maintaining the structure of the cell layer structure. We suggest the mammalian 
cell model utilized within this study as an adaptable in vitro model that can be 
employed to enable a better understanding of phage-bacteria interactions and the 
protective impact of phage therapy relating to the intestinal epithelium.
