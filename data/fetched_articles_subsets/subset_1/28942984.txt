BACKGROUND: Cluster analyses were previously performed to identify asthma 
phenotypes underlying asthma syndrome. Although a large number of patients with 
asthma develop the disease later in life, these previous cluster analyses 
focused mainly patients with younger-onset asthma.
METHODS: Cluster analysis examined the existence of distinct phenotypes of 
late-onset asthma in Japanese patients with adult asthma. We then associated 
genotypes at the CCL5, TSLP, IL4, and ADRB2 genes with the clusters of asthma 
identified.
RESULTS: Using the 8 variables of age, sex, age at onset of the disease, smoking 
status, total serum IgE, %FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and specific IgE responsiveness to 
common inhaled allergens, two-step cluster analysis of 880 Japanese adult asthma 
patients identified 6 phenotypes: cluster A (n = 155): older age at onset, no 
airflow obstruction; cluster B (n = 170): childhood onset, normal-to-mild 
airflow obstruction; cluster C (n = 119): childhood onset, the longest disease 
duration, and moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction; cluster D (n = 108): older 
age at onset, severe airflow obstruction; cluster E (n = 130): middle-age at 
onset, no airflow obstruction; and cluster F (n = 198): older age at onset, 
mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction. The CCL5-28C>G genotype was significantly 
associated with clusters A, B and D (OR 1.65, p = 0.0021; 1.67, 0.018; and 1.74, 
0.011, respectively). The ADRB2 Arg16Gly genotype was also associated with 
clusters B and D (OR 0.47, p = 0.0004; and 0.63, 0.034, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The current cluster analysis identified meaningful adult asthma 
phenotypes linked to the functional CCL5 and ADRB2 genotypes. Genetic and 
phenotypic data have the potential to elucidate the pheno- typic heterogeneity 
and pathophysiology of asthma.
