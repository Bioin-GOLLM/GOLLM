Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with the etiologies of sensorineural 
hearing loss, such as age-related hearing loss, noise- and ototoxic drug-induced 
hearing loss, as well as hearing loss due to mitochondrial gene mutation. 
Mitochondria are the main sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
ROS-induced oxidative stress is involved in cochlear damage. Moreover, the 
release of ROS causes further damage to mitochondrial components. Antioxidants 
are thought to counteract the deleterious effects of ROS and thus, may be 
effective for the treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases. The 
administration of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants is one of the drug delivery 
systems targeted to mitochondria. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants are 
expected to help in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases associated with 
mitochondrial dysfunction. Of the various mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, 
the protective effects of MitoQ and SkQR1 against ototoxicity have been 
previously evaluated in animal models and/or mouse auditory cell lines. MitoQ 
protects against both gentamicin- and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. SkQR1 also 
provides auditory protective effects against gentamicin-induced ototoxicity. On 
the other hand, decreasing effect of MitoQ on gentamicin-induced cell apoptosis 
in auditory cell lines has been controversial. No clinical studies have been 
reported for otoprotection using mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants. 
High-quality clinical trials are required to reveal the therapeutic effect of 
mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in terms of otoprotection in patients.
