Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged into a 
world of maturing pathogen genomics, with more than 2 million genomes sequenced 
at the time of writing. The rise of more transmissible variants of concern that 
impact vaccine and therapeutic effectiveness has led to widespread interest in 
SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Clinicians are also eager to take advantage of the 
information provided by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping beyond surveillance purposes. 
Here, we review the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 genotyping in clinical care. 
The review covers clinical use cases for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping, methods of 
SARS-CoV-2 genotyping, assay validation and regulatory requirements, and 
clinical reporting for laboratories, as well as emerging issues in clinical 
SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. While clinical uses of SARS-CoV-2 genotyping are 
currently limited, rapid technological change along with a growing ability to 
interpret variants in real time foretells a growing role for SARS-CoV-2 
genotyping in clinical care as continuing data emerge on vaccine and therapeutic 
efficacy.
