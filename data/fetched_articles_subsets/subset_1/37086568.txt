BACKGROUND: CLN3 is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder with intracellular 
accumulation of ceroid-lipofuscins. CLN3 classically has onset around 4-6 years 
of age involving vision loss, followed by developmental regression and seizures. 
Symptoms are progressive and result in premature death. Because treatments are 
under development, here we explore magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
measurements of metabolite levels in the brain as a potential objective outcome 
measures.
METHODS: Individuals with genetically confirmed CLN3 were enrolled from October 
2017-November 2021 in a prospective natural history study (NCT033007304). 
Baseline concentrations of brain metabolites measured by MRS were compared to 
concurrently collected dimensional assessment measures: Vineland-3 Adaptive 
Behavior Composite (ABC) score, verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ), and the 
Physical, Capability with actual vision, and Clinical global impression of 
change sub-domains of the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS).
RESULTS: 27 participants with typical CLN3 presentation (15F:12M; ages 
6.0-20.7 years) completed MRS, ABC, and UBDRS; 20 (12F:8M; ages 6.5-20.7 years) 
also completed the VIQ assessment. N-acetyl aspartate [B(95% 
CI) = -0.61(-0.78;-0.45)] and glutamine/glutamate/GABA [B(95% 
CI) = -0.82(-1.04;-0.6)] in the parietal gray matter (PGM) decreased across the 
ages. The strongest correlations between MRS metabolite measurements and the 
clinical severity assessments were found with N-acetyl aspartate [VIQ 
(ρ = 0.58), Vineland-3 ABC (ρ = 0.59), UBDRS |ρ| range = (0.57;0.7)] and 
glutamine/glutamate/GABA [VIQ (ρ = 0.57), Vineland-3 ABC (ρ = 0.60), UBDRS |ρ| 
range = (0.59;0.77)] measured in the midline PGM. These correlations were 
accounted for when age was considered.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on their correlations to established assessments, NAA and 
glutamine/glutamate/GABA measured in the midline parietal gray matter may be 
useful indicators of CLN3 disease state. In a clinical trial, divergence of the 
MRS measurements and clinical severity markers from age may be useful as 
surrogate measures for treatment responses.
