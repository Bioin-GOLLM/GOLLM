Mutations in voltage-gated potassium channel KCNE1 cause Jervell and 
Lange-Nielsen syndrome type 2 (JLNS2), resulting in congenital deafness and 
vestibular dysfunction. We conducted gene therapy by injecting viral vectors 
using the canalostomy approach in Kcne1-/- mice to treat both the hearing and 
vestibular symptoms. Results showed early treatment prevented collapse of the 
Reissner's membrane and vestibular wall, retained the normal size of the 
semicircular canals, and prevented the degeneration of inner ear cells. In a 
dose-dependent manner, the treatment preserved auditory (16 out of 20 mice) and 
vestibular (20/20) functions in mice treated with the high-dosage for at least 
five months. In the low-dosage group, a subgroup of mice (13/20) showed 
improvements only in the vestibular functions. Results supported that highly 
efficient transduction is one of the key factors for achieving the efficacy and 
maintaining the long-term therapeutic effect. Secondary outcomes of treatment 
included improved birth and litter survival rates. Our results demonstrated that 
gene therapy via the canalostomy approach, which has been considered to be one 
of the more feasible delivery methods for human inner ear gene therapy, 
preserved auditory and vestibular functions in a dose-dependent manner in a 
mouse model of JLNS2.
