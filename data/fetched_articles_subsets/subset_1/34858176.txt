Liquid biopsy represents a valid strategy for tumor molecular characterization. 
It gives the opportunity to bypass tumor heterogeneity, to monitor tumor 
characteristics during the course of treatment, and to perform the analysis even 
when tumor tissue is not available or inadequate. In the clinical practice of 
metastatic colorectal cancer, tumor molecular characterization is crucial for 
patient management, as RAS and BRAF status could influence the treatment choice. 
Although for this type of cancer tumor tissue is usually available at diagnosis, 
liquid biopsy could give complementary information and could permit monitoring 
of the mutation status during the course of treatment. At present, there are no 
clinical indications for its use in clinical practice. However, we report four 
clinical cases for which liquid biopsy analysis gave integrative information 
with respect to tumor tissue characterization, which permits us to understand 
the unresponsiveness of patients to treatment, with potential implications in 
patient's management.
