Although numerous strategies have been developed to reduce the initial ischemic 
insult and cellular injury that occurs during myocardial infarction (MI), few 
have progressed into the clinical arena. The epidemiologic and economic impact 
of MI necessitates the development of innovative therapies to rapidly and 
effectively reduce the initial injury and subsequent cardiac dysfunction. The 
Eph receptors and their cognate ligands, the ephrins, are the largest family of 
receptor tyrosine kinases, and their signaling has been shown to play a diverse 
role in various cellular processes. The recent advances in the study of 
ephrin-Eph signaling have shown promising progress in many fields of medicine. 
They have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various cancers and in the 
regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that 
manipulation of ephrin-Eph cell signaling can favorably influence cardiomyocyte 
viability and ultimately preserve cardiac function post-MI. In this article, we 
explore the hypothesis that manipulation of ephrin-Eph signaling may potentially 
be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of MI through alteration of the 
cellular processes that govern injury and wound healing.
