BACKGROUND: NAT2, the most important phase II metabolic enzyme for betel quid 
(BQ), might modify the risk of BQ-related oral and pharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OPSCC) in Taiwan.
STUDY DESIGN: PCR-RFLP and TaqMan assay were conducted for genotyping of NAT2 in 
172 OPSCC cases and 170 healthy controls who habitually chewed BQ.
RESULTS: The genotypic and allelic type of T341C and C481T in NAT2 are 
associated with the risk of OPSCC. There were linear trends between increased 
risk of OPSCC and slowness of NAT2 acetylation haplotypes (P = .017), especially 
for young subjects (P < .001), light BQ chewers (P = .005), light smokers (P = 
.023), and alcohol drinkers (P = .001). The interactions on risk of OPSCC were 
found for NAT2 acetylation haplotypes with status of age, BQ chewing, and 
alcohol drinking.
CONCLUSIONS: The NAT2 acetylation haplotypes might be genetic markers for risk 
of BQ-related OPSCC.
