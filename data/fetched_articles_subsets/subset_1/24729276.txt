The self-assembly of several classes of amphiphilic peptides is reviewed, and 
selected applications are discussed. We discuss recent work on the self-assembly 
of lipopeptides, surfactant-like peptides and amyloid peptides derived from the 
amyloid-β peptide. The influence of environmental variables such as pH and 
temperature on aggregate nanostructure is discussed. Enzyme-induced remodelling 
due to peptide cleavage and nanostructure control through photocleavage or 
photo-cross-linking are also considered. Lastly, selected applications of 
amphiphilic peptides in biomedicine and materials science are outlined.
