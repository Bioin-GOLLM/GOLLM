Hearing threshold was analyzed for each frequency in relation to age in 88 
members of a large Dutch family with cochleovestibular impairment caused by a 
P51S mutation in the COCH gene within the DFNA9 locus (chromosome 14q12-13). The 
participants in this study were 34 mutation carriers and 54 relatives without 
the mutation (control subjects). A sigmoidal dose-response curve with a variable 
slope was used to fit the mutation carriers' threshold-on-age data. Progression 
started at about 40 years of age and only lasted for some 20 to 25 years; the 
associated average progression was 2.9 dB/y for all frequencies. However, some 
hearing impairment was already present before, predominantly at the high 
frequencies. The mean thresholds in the young mutation carriers (< 33 years of 
age) were significantly higher (by 4 to 13 dB) than those in age-matched 
controls at 2 to 8 kHz. Presumably, mutation carriers have a congenital, stable 
offset threshold (10 to 29 dB) at these frequencies, and develop progression 
later in life.
