Significant knowledge about the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
been gained in the last century; however, the understanding of its causes of 
onset remains limited. Late-onset AD is observed in about 95% of patients, and 
APOE4-encoding apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is strongly associated with these 
cases. As an apolipoprotein, the function of ApoE in brain cholesterol transport 
has been extensively studied and widely appreciated. Development of new 
technologies such as human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and 
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools have enabled us to develop human brain model 
systems in vitro and readily manipulate genomic information. In the context of 
these advances, recent studies provide strong evidence that abnormal cholesterol 
metabolism by ApoE4 could be linked to AD-associated pathology. In this review, 
we discuss novel discoveries in brain cholesterol dysregulation by ApoE4. We 
further elaborate cell type-specific roles in cholesterol regulation of four 
major brain cell types, neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, 
and how its dysregulation can be linked to AD pathology.
