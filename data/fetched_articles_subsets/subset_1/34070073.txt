Two new spirostanol sapogenins (5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,2β,3β,5β-tetrol 3 and 
its 25,27-dihydro derivative, (25S)-spirostan-1β,2β,3β,5β-tetrol 4) and four new 
saponins were isolated from the roots and rhizomes of Convallaria majalis L. 
together with known sapogenins (isolated from Liliaceae): 
5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,3β-diol 1, (25S)-spirostan-1β,3β-diol 2, 
5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,3β,4β,5β-tetrol 5, (25S)-spirostan-1β,3β,4β,5β-tetrol 6, 
5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 7 and 
(25S)-spirostan-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 8. New steroidal saponins were found to be 
pentahydroxy 5-O-glycosides; 5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 
5-O-β-galactopyranoside 9, 5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 
5-O-β-arabinonoside 11, 5β-(25S)-spirostan-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 5-O-galactoside 
10 and 5β-(25S)-spirostan-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 5-O-arabinoside 12 were isolated 
for the first time. The structures of those compounds were determined by NMR 
spectroscopy, including 2D COSY, HMBC, HSQC, NOESY, ROESY experiments, 
theoretical calculations of shielding constants by GIAO DFT, and mass 
spectrometry (FAB/LSI HR MS). An attempt was made to test biological activity, 
particularly as potential chemotherapeutic agents, using in silico methods. A 
set of 12 compounds was docked to the PDB structures of HER2 receptor and 
tubulin. The results indicated that diols have a higher affinity to the analyzed 
targets than tetrols and pentols. Two compounds (25S)-spirosten-1β,3β-diol 1 and 
5β-spirost-25(27)-en-1β,2β,3β,4β,5β-pentol 5-O-galactoside 9 were selected for 
further evaluation of biological activity.
