OBJECTIVE: To study the genetic association between methylenetetrahydrofolate 
reductase (MTHFR) A1298 polymorphism and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).
DESIGN: Prospective case-control study, systematic review, and meta-analysis 
using an electronic database up to July 27, 2012.
SETTING: Meta-analysis of four studies on RPL and three studies on spontaneously 
aborted embryos, including the present study.
PATIENT(S): A total of 129 RPL patients and 202 healthy control women with 
successful pregnancy were analyzed including 40 spontaneously aborted embryos 
and 40 aborted embryos as control samples. For meta-analysis, 1,080 case and 709 
control subjects were included of RPL and 375 case and 384 control samples of 
spontaneously aborted embryos.
INTERVENTION(S): Blood was collected by peripheral venous punctures, and 
spontaneously aborted embryos were collected by curettage or manual vacuum 
aspiration. Meta-analysis was done on the basis of heterogeneity of the studies.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-restriction-fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP). DNA sequencing was used 
to ascertain PCR-RFLP results. Age-adjusted odds ratios were calculated by 
logistic regression analysis. Meta-analysis on this polymorphism was conducted 
to support our findings.
RESULT(S): We found that presence of rare allele "C" and heterozygous and rare 
homozygous genotypes significantly increased the risk of RPL. No significant 
change in the fetal MTHFR A1298C genotype frequency was observed, regardless of 
chromosomal integrity. Meta-analysis of A1298C polymorphism on both RPL and in 
spontaneously aborted embryos showed significantly increased risk in the 
carriers of AC and CC genotypes.
CONCLUSION(S): The data of the present study clearly suggests that MTHFR A1298C 
polymorphism is a genetic risk factor for pregnancy loss.
