The Veterans Affairs Hypertension Primary Care Longitudinal Cohort (VAHC) was 
initiated in 2003 as a pilot study designed to link the VA electronic medical 
record system with individual genetic data. Between June 2003 and December 2004, 
1,527 hypertensive participants were recruited. Protected health information 
(PHI) was extracted from the regional VA data warehouse. Differences between the 
clinic and mail recruits suggested that clinic recruitment resulted in an 
over-sampling of African Americans. A review of medical records in a random 
sample of study participants confirmed that the data warehouse accurately 
captured most selected diagnoses. Genomic DNA was acquired non-invasively from 
buccal cells in mouthwash; ~ 96.5 per cent of samples contained DNA suitable for 
genotyping, with an average DNA yield of 5.02 Â± 0.12 micrograms, enough for 
several thousand genotypes. The coupling of detailed medical databases with 
genetic information has the potential to facilitate the genetic study of 
hypertension and other complex diseases.
