Alternaria sp. MG1, an endophytic fungus isolated from Vitis vinifera, can 
independently produce resveratrol, indicating that this species contains the key 
genes for resveratrol biosynthesis. Identification of these key genes is 
essential to understand the resveratrol biosynthesis pathway in this strain, 
which is currently unknown in microorganisms. qRT-PCR is an efficient and widely 
used method to identify the key genes related to unknown pathways at the level 
of gene expression. Verification of stable reference genes in this strain is 
essential for qRT-PCR data normalization, although results have been reported 
for other Alternaria sp. strains. In this study, nine candidate reference genes 
including TUBA, EF1, EF2, UBC, UFD, RPS5, RPS24, ACTB and 18S were evaluated for 
expression stability in a diverse set of six samples representing different 
growth periods. We compared cell culture conditions and an optimized condition 
for resveratrol production. The comparison of the results was performed using 
four statistical softwares. A combination of TUBA and EF1 was found to be 
suitable for normalization of Alternaria sp. MG1 in different developmental 
stages, and 18S was found to be the least stable. The reference genes verified 
in this study will facilitate further research to explore gene expression and 
molecular mechanisms as well as the improvement of secondary metabolite yields 
in Alternaria sp. MG1. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of 
reference genes in Alternaria with the capability to produce resveratrol. 
Additionally, these results provide useful guidelines for the selection of 
reference genes in other Alternaria species.
