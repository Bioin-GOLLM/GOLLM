Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a chronic condition and individuals are 
exposed to elevated androgen levels in utero as a result of the endogenous 
cortisol deficiency. Prenatal androgen exposure has been suggested to influence 
mental health, but population based studies on psychiatric morbidity among girls 
and women with CAH are lacking. Therefore, we performed a cohort study based on 
Swedish nationwide registers linked with the national CAH register. Girls and 
women with CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (n = 335) born between January 
1915 and January 2010 were compared with aged-matched female (n = 33500) and 
male controls (n = 33500). Analyses were stratified by phenotype [salt wasting 
(SW), simple virilizing (SV), and non-classical type (NC)] and by CYP21A2 
genotype subgroups (null, I2splice, I172N, and P30L). Results are presented as 
estimated risks (OR, 95%CI) of psychiatric disorders among girls and women with 
CAH compared with age-matched controls. Any psychiatric diagnoses were more 
common in CAH females compared with female and male population controls [1.9 
(1.4-2.5), and 2.2 (1.7-2.9)]. In particular, the risk of alcohol misuse was 
increased compared with female and male population controls [2.8 (1.7-4.7) and 
2.1 (1.2-3.5)], and appeared most common among the girls and women with the most 
severe null genotype [6.7 (2.6-17.8)]. The risk of stress and adjustment 
disorders was doubled compared with female population controls [2.1 (1.3-3.6)]. 
Girls and women with CAH have an increased risk of psychiatric disorders in 
general and substance use disorders in particular compared with unexposed 
females, with the highest risk among those with the most severe genotype. 
Prenatal androgen exposure and deficient endogenous cortisol and/or adrenaline 
production may provide explanations for these findings, but other factors 
related to CAH cannot be excluded.
