Antithrombin Pittsburgh: an alpha1-antitrypsin variant causing hemorrhagic 
disease.

Lewis JH, Iammarino RM, Spero JA, Hasiba U.

A 10-year-old boy had a severe lifelong hemorrhagic disorder that had 
necessitated more than 50 hospitalizations. Laboratory examination showed 
prolonged bleeding, clotting, partial thromboplastin, prothrombin, and thrombin 
times. These findings were due to a potent inhibitor of the thrombin-fibrinogen 
reaction. This inhibitor was similar to heparin in that it acted immediately and 
did not interfere with the coagulant activities of certain venoms. It differed 
from heparin in not being adsorbed to barium citrate or neutralized by protamine 
sulfate. The inhibitory effect was found in the alpha1-globulin fraction. It was 
identified immunologically and functionally as a double-banded 
alpha1-antitrypsin of a previously unreported phenotype. The inhibitory effects 
were depressed by trypsin and heterologous anti-alpha1-antitrypsin.
