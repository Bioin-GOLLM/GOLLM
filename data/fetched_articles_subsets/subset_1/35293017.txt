BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) gene polymorphism and metabolic 
syndrome (Mets) are generally considered to be risk factors for prostate cancer 
(PCa). However, this conclusion is still controversial. There is a close 
relationship between GSTs gene polymorphism and Mets. We suspect that the effect 
of GSTs gene polymorphism and Mets on PCa may be the result of their joint 
action. As a result, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential 
effect of GSTs gene polymorphism on PCa in patients with Mets.
METHODS: We collected blood samples from 128 patients with PCa and 200 controls. 
The GSTs gene polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Age, characteristics of Mets, 
frequencies of GSTs gene polymorphism, total prostate volume (TPV), Gleason 
score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: There were significant differences in BMI, TG, LDL-C, FBG, SBP, DBP, 
and HDL-C among the control group, N-PCa group, and Mets-PCa group (p < 0.05). 
GSTT1 null genotype (OR = 2.844, 95% CI: 1.791-4.517), GSTM1 null genotype 
(OR = 2.192, 95% CI: 1.395-3.446), and GSTP1 (A/G + G/G) genotype (OR = 2.315, 
95% CI: 1.465-3.657) were associated with PCa susceptibility and malignancy. 
Only the GSTT1 null genotype in Mets patients was positively correlated with 
PCa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that GSTs gene polymorphism may be a risk factor 
for PCa and can predict the susceptibility and malignancy of PCa. Secondly, in 
Mets patients, GSTT1 null genotype significantly increased the risk of PCa. 
GSTM1 null genotype and the effect of GSTP1 (AG + GG) on PCa were not 
significantly related to Mets.
