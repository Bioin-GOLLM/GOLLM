The relationship between depression, its etiology and therapy, and the cAMP 
signaling system have been studies for decades. This review will focus on cAMP, 
G proteins and adenylyl cyclase and depression or antidepressant action. Both 
human and animal studies are compared and contrasted. It is concluded that there 
is some synteny in the findings that cAMP signaling is attenuated in depression 
and that this is reversed by successful antidepressant therapy. The G protein 
that activates adenylyl cyclase, Gαs, appears to have diminished access to 
adenylyl cyclase in depression, and this is rectified by successful 
antidepressant treatment. Unfortunately, attempts to link specific isoforms of 
adenylyl cyclase to depression or antidepressant action suffer from 
discontinuity between human and animal studies.
