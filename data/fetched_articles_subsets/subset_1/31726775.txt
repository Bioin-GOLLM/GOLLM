Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are probably the most important growth 
factors in bone formation and healing. However, the utilization of BMPs in 
clinical applications is mainly limited due to the protein poor solubility at 
physiological pH, rapid clearance and relatively short biological half-life. 
Herein, we develop degradable porous silicon (PSi)-based carriers for sustained 
delivery of BMP-2. Two different loading approaches are examined, physical 
adsorption and covalent conjugation, and their effect on the protein loading and 
release rate is thoroughly studied. The entrapment of the protein within the PSi 
nanostructures preserved its bioactivity for inducing osteogenic differentiation 
of rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stems cells (BM-MSCs). BM-MSCs cultured with 
the BMP-2 loaded PSi carriers exhibit a relatively high alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) activity. We also demonstrate that exposure of MSCs to empty PSi (no 
protein) carriers generates some extent of differentiation due to the ability of 
the carrier's degradation products to induce osteoblast differentiation. 
Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these promising BMP-2 carriers within 
a 3D-printed patient-specific implant, constructed of poly(caprolactone) (PCL), 
as a potential bone graft for critical size bone defects.
