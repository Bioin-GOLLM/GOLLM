AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Adipose tissue-derived hormones are associated with metabolic 
disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present study investigated the 
levels of adiponectin and pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis 
factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-10 in Vietnamese patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and their correlations with clinical parameters 
of overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on body mass index, 73 patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus were categorized either as overweight or non-overweight. As 
healthy controls, 57 overweight and non-overweight individuals without type 2 
diabetes mellitus were included. The adiponectin, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 levels 
were measured in the sera samples in all study participants by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay and were correlated with clinical parameters.
RESULTS: The adiponectin levels were lower in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (2.5 ± 1.5 μg/mL) compared with controls (16 ± 18.6 μg/mL; P < 0.0001), 
and were decreased in overweight individuals compared with those who were not 
overweight. The TNF-α and IL-1β levels were increased, whereas the IL-10 levels 
were decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in overweight 
controls compared with non-overweight controls (P < 0.0001). The adiponectin 
levels were correlated with the TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10 levels, and the clinical 
parameters of overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The quantitative insulin 
sensitivity check index and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance 
indexes were correlated with the relative ratios of adiponectin/TNF-α, 
adiponectin/IL-1β, adiponectin/IL-10, TNF-α/IL-10 and IL-1β/IL-10.
CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin and pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with type 
2 diabetes mellitus, and might serve as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic 
intervention for overweight-related type 2 diabetes mellitus.
