BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hypercoagulable states may play an important role in the 
pathogenesis of colon ischemia. Aim of this study was to assess this hypothesis 
investigating the role of acquired and hereditary thrombotic risk factors in 
patients with definite diagnosis of colon ischemia.
METHODS: We compared the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C, 
protein S, and antithrombin deficiencies, factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene 
mutation G20210GA, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T in 36 patients 
(23 men, 13 women; mean age, 64.8 years) with colon ischemia, 18 patients with 
diverticulitis, and 52 healthy controls.
RESULTS: The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was significantly higher 
in patients with colon ischemia compared with inflammatory and healthy controls 
(19.4% vs. 0% and 1.9%). Among genetic factors, only factor V Leiden was 
significantly associated with colon ischemia (22.2% vs. 0% and 3.8%). A 
combination of thrombophilic disorders was found in 25% of the cases. Overall, 
one or several prothrombotic abnormalities were present in 26 patients (72%).
CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive thrombophilic screening in colon ischemia reveals a 
congenital or acquired thrombophilic state in 72% of patients. Hereditary and 
acquired thrombotic risk factors may play an important role in the disease 
pathogenesis.
