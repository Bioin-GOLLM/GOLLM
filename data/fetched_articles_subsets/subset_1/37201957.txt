225Ac-targeted α-radiotherapy is a promising approach to treating malignancies, 
including prostate cancer. However, α-emitting isotopes are difficult to image 
because of low administered activities and a low fraction of suitable 
γ-emissions. The in vivo generator 134Ce/134La has been proposed as a potential 
PET imaging surrogate for the therapeutic nuclides 225Ac and 227Th. In this 
report, we detail efficient radiolabeling methods using the 225Ac-chelators DOTA 
and MACROPA. These methods were applied to radiolabeling of prostate cancer 
imaging agents, including PSMA-617 and MACROPA-PEG4-YS5, for evaluation of their 
in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics and comparison to the corresponding 
225Ac analogs. Methods: Radiolabeling was performed by mixing DOTA/MACROPA 
chelates with 134Ce/134La in NH4OAc, pH 8.0, at room temperature, and 
radiochemical yields were monitored by radio-thin-layer chromatography. In vivo 
biodistributions of 134Ce-DOTA/MACROPA.NH2 complexes were assayed through 
dynamic small-animal PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies over 1 h 
in healthy C57BL/6 mice, compared with free 134CeCl3 In vivo, preclinical 
imaging of 134Ce-PSMA-617 and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 was performed on 22Rv1 
tumor-bearing male nu/nu-mice. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed for 
134Ce/225Ac-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 conjugates. Results: 134Ce-MACROPA.NH2 demonstrated 
near-quantitative labeling with 1:1 ligand-to-metal ratios at room temperature, 
whereas a 10:1 ligand-to-metal ratio and elevated temperatures were required for 
DOTA. Rapid urinary excretion and low liver and bone uptake were seen for 
134Ce/225Ac-DOTA/MACROPA. NH2 conjugates in comparison to free 134CeCl3 
confirmed high in vivo stability. An interesting observation during the 
radiolabeling of tumor-targeting vectors PSMA-617 and MACROPA-PEG4-YS5-that the 
daughter 134La was expelled from the chelate after the decay of parent 134Ce-was 
confirmed through radio-thin-layer chromatography and reverse-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography. Both conjugates, 134Ce-PSMA-617 and 
134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5, displayed tumor uptake in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. The 
ex vivo biodistribution of 134Ce-MACROPA.NH2, 134Ce-DOTA and 
134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 corroborated well with the respective 225Ac-conjugates. 
Conclusion: These results demonstrate the PET imaging potential for 
134Ce/134La-labeled small-molecule and antibody agents. The similar 225Ac and 
134Ce/134La-chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics suggest that the 
134Ce/134La pair may act as a PET imaging surrogate for 225Ac-based radioligand 
therapies.
