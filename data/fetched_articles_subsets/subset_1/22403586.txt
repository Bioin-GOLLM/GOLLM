Kinase inhibitors in the treatment of immune-mediated disease.

Kontzias A, Laurence A, Gadina M, O'Shea JJ.

Protein kinases are fundamental components of diverse signaling pathways, 
including immune cells. Their essential functions have made them effective 
therapeutic targets. Initially, the expectation was that a high degree of 
selectivity would be critical; however, with time, the use of "multikinase" 
inhibitors has expanded. Moreover, the spectrum of diseases in which kinase 
inhibitors are used has also expanded to include not only malignancies but also 
immune-mediated diseases. At present, thirteen kinase inhibitors have been 
approved in the United States, all for oncologic indications. However, there are 
a growing number of molecules, including several Janus kinase inhibitors, that 
are being tested in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. It appears likely that 
this new class of immunomodulatory drugs will have a major impact on the 
treatment of immune-mediated diseases in the near future.
