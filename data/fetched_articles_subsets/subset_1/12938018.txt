We have previously demonstrated that compound heterozygous (SAO/G701D) and 
homozygous (G701D/G701D) mutations of the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) gene, encoding 
erythroid and kidney AE1 proteins, cause autosomal recessive distal renal 
tubular acidosis (AR dRTA) in Thai patients. It is thus of interest to examine 
the prevalence of these mutations in the Thai population. The SAO and G701D 
mutations were examined in 844 individuals from north, northeast, central, and 
south Thailand. Other reported mutations including R602H, DeltaV850, and A858D 
were also examined in some groups of subjects. The SAO mutation was common in 
the southern Thai population; its heterozygote frequency was 7/206 and estimated 
allele frequency 1.70%. However, this mutation was not observed in populations 
of three other regions of Thailand. In contrast, the G701D mutation was not 
found in the southern population but was observed in the northern, northeastern, 
and central populations, with heterozygote frequencies of 1/216, 3/205, and 
1/217, and estimated allele frequencies of 0.23%, 0.73%, and 0.23%, 
respectively. The higher allele frequency of the G701D mutation in the 
northeastern Thai population corresponds to our previous finding that all Thai 
patients with AR dRTA attributable to homozygous G701D mutation originate from 
this population. This suggests that the G701D allele that is observed in this 
region might arise in northeastern Thailand. The presence of patients with 
compound heterozygous SAO/G701D in southern Thailand and Malaysia and their 
apparently absence in northeastern Thailand indicate that the G701D allele may 
have migrated to the southern peninsular region where SAO is common, resulting 
in pathogenic allelic interaction.
