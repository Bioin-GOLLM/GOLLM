BACKGROUND: Proteins that evolve from a common ancestor can change functionality 
over time, and it is important to be able identify residues that cause this 
change. In this paper we show how a supervised multivariate statistical method, 
Between Group Analysis (BGA), can be used to identify these residues from 
families of proteins with different substrate specifities using multiple 
sequence alignments.
RESULTS: We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on three different test 
cases. Two of these test cases, the Lactate/Malate dehydrogenase family and 
Nucleotidyl Cyclases, consist of two functional groups. The other family, Serine 
Proteases consists of three groups. BGA was used to analyse and visualise these 
three families using two different encoding schemes for the amino acids.
CONCLUSION: This overall combination of methods in this paper is powerful and 
flexible while being computationally very fast and simple. BGA is especially 
useful because it can be used to analyse any number of functional classes. In 
the examples we used in this paper, we have only used 2 or 3 classes for 
demonstration purposes but any number can be used and visualised.
