The American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, like all crocodilians, has 
temperature-dependent sex determination, in which the sex of an embryo is 
determined by the incubation temperature of the egg during a critical period of 
development. The lack of genetic differences between male and female alligators 
leaves open the question of how the genes responsible for sex determination and 
differentiation are regulated. Insight into this question comes from the fact 
that exposing an embryo incubated at male-producing temperature to estrogen 
causes it to develop ovaries. Because estrogen response elements are known to 
regulate genes over long distances, a contiguous genome assembly is crucial for 
predicting and understanding their impact. We present an improved assembly of 
the American alligator genome, scaffolded with in vitro proximity ligation 
(Chicago) data. We use this assembly to scaffold two other crocodilian genomes 
based on synteny. We perform RNA sequencing of tissues from American alligator 
embryos to find genes that are differentially expressed between embryos 
incubated at male- versus female-producing temperature. Finally, we use the 
improved contiguity of our assembly along with the current model of 
CTCF-mediated chromatin looping to predict regions of the genome likely to 
contain estrogen-responsive genes. We find that these regions are significantly 
enriched for genes with female-biased expression in developing gonads after the 
critical period during which sex is determined by incubation temperature. We 
thus conclude that estrogen signaling is a major driver of female-biased gene 
expression in the post-temperature sensitive period gonads.
