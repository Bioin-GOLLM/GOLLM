Embedded viral barcoding in combination with high-throughput sequencing is a 
powerful technology with which to track single-cell clones. It can provide 
clonal-level insights into cellular proliferation, development, differentiation, 
migration, and treatment efficacy. Here, we present a detailed protocol for a 
viral barcoding procedure that includes the creation of barcode libraries, the 
viral delivery of barcodes, the recovery of barcodes, and the computational 
analysis of barcode sequencing data. The entire procedure can be completed 
within a few weeks. This barcoding method requires cells to be susceptible to 
viral transduction. It provides high sensitivity and throughput, and enables 
precise quantification of cellular progeny. It is cost efficient and does not 
require any advanced skills. It can also be easily adapted to many types of 
applications, including both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
