Fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based executioner caspase reporters using 
GFP are important tools for imaging apoptosis. While these reporters are useful 
for imaging apoptosis in cultured cells, their in vivo application has been 
handicapped by poor signal to noise. Here, we report the design and 
characterization of a GFP-based fluorogenic protease reporter, dubbed ZipGFP. 
ZipGFP-based TEV protease reporter increased fluorescence 10-fold after 
activation by protease. A ZipGFP-based executioner caspase reporter visualized 
apoptosis in live zebrafish embryos with spatiotemporal resolution. Thus, the 
ZipGFP-based caspase reporter may be useful for monitoring apoptosis during 
animal development and for designing reporters of proteases beyond the 
executioner caspases.
