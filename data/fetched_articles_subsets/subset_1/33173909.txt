BACKGROUND: The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is susceptible to mutations during viral 
replication due to the errors generated by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These 
mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies 
emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, 
these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal 
the patterns of transmission and have utility in contract tracing.
METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a 
viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a 
rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short 
tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this 
method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with 
specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed 
a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, 
detect quasispecies and identify mutation signatures from patients. These 
results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints.
RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and 
identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across 
thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common 
genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and rare 
ones that occur in only small fraction of patients. We developed a targeted 
sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to 
flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we 
identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen 
across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual 
infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing 
analysis with the features of the pangenome.
CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide 
the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with 
targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies 
mutations occurring within individual patients, mutations demarcating dominant 
species and the prevalence of mutation signatures, of which a significant number 
were relatively unique. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way 
of conducting molecular contact tracing.
