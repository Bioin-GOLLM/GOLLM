The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in the majority of patients with a 
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and is sufficient to recapitulate an MPN in 
murine models. However, the consequences of JAK2 mutations for myeloid 
differentiation are poorly understood. After systematic analyses of a large 
cohort of JAK2-mutated MPN patients, we demonstrate in vivo that JAK2 mutations 
do not alter hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell com-partment size or in 
vitro behavior but generate expansion of later myeloid differentiation 
compartments, where homozygous expression of the mutation confers an added 
proliferative advantage at the single-cell level. In addition, we demonstrate 
that these findings may be partially explained by the expression pattern of 
JAK2, which markedly increases on myeloid differentiation. Our findings have 
potential clinical relevance, as they predict that JAK2 inhibitors may control 
myeloproliferation, but may have limited efficacy in eradicating the leukemic 
stem cells that sustain the human MPN.
