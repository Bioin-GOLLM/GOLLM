We report the unusual features of a female patient who had MELAS-specific A3243G 
mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient 
showed mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and deafness but 
lacked the stroke-like episode. Acute hyperglycemia was noted after one attack 
of status epilepticus. Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated a heteroplasmic 
A3243G point mutation in the mtDNAs of muscle, blood cells and hair follicles. 
Glucagon stimulation test exhibited marked depression of pancreatic beta-cell 
function. However, in a further study neither this mutation, nor MELAS syndrome 
or DM, was found in all of her maternal relatives. A series of follow-up studies 
for beta-cell function also showed gradual improvement. The pedigree study led 
us to believe that this A3243G mutation arose from the germ line cells or 
occurred later in somatic tissues of the patient. We also suggest that the 
A3243G mutation of mtDNA may elicit the pathogenesis of a subtype of DM. 
Nevertheless, environmental stress may be another important factor for 
provocation of the disease.
