Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo spectroscopy was used to 
measure the fast dynamics of two variants of chicken villin headpiece 35 (HP35). 
The CN of cyanophenylalanine residues inserted in the hydrophobic core were used 
as a vibrational probe. Experiments were performed on both singly (HP35-P) and 
doubly CN-labeled peptide (HP35-P(2)) within the wild-type sequence, as well as 
on HP-35 containing a singly labeled cyanophenylalanine and two norleucine 
mutations (HP35-P NleNle). There is a remarkable similarity between the dynamics 
measured in singly and doubly CN-labeled HP35, demonstrating that the presence 
of an additional CN vibrational probe does not significantly alter the dynamics 
of the small peptide. The substitution of two lysine residues by norleucines 
markedly improves the stability of HP35 by replacing charged with nonpolar 
residues, stabilizing the hydrophobic core. The results of the 2D IR experiments 
reveal that the dynamics of HP35-P are significantly faster than those of HP35-P 
NleNle. These observations suggest that the slower structural fluctuations in 
the hydrophobic core, indicating a more tightly structured core, may be an 
important contributing factor to HP35-P NleNle's increased stability.
