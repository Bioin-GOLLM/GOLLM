OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the association of dopamine 
receptor D2 (DRD2) polymorphism and alleviation of obesity in children and 
adolescents after 8-year follow-up.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included obese children and adolescents 
with a follow-up period of 8 years. Baseline clinical characteristics and DRD2 
polymorphisms (including rs1076562, rs2075654, and rs4586205) were extracted 
from medical records. A follow-up visit was performed in May 2017 to collect 
related data including height, weight, diet compliance, and exercise compliance.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine obese children and adolescents were included in 
the current study. Among three DRD2 single nucleotide polymorphisms, only 
rs2075654 had a statistically significant association with alleviation of 
obesity, as the alleviation rate for minor allele carriers (68.6% for TC+TT) was 
higher compared to the major allele homozygote (43.3% for CC). After adjusting 
for all related factors, the hazard ratio of rs2075654 minor allele carriers for 
the alleviation of obesity was 3.34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30â€’8.58).
CONCLUSIONS: The rs2075654 polymorphism of DRD2 is related to long-term obesity 
alleviation in obese Chinese children and adolescents.
