A six-month double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study was conducted to 
ascertain whether low-dose daily niacin supplementation would improve motor 
symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. A total of 47 PD patients were 
assigned to receive low-dose niacin or a placebo. At the end of the double-blind 
phase, all participants received open-label niacin for the next six months. All 
patients were evaluated at baseline, after six months, and after one year of 
treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) scores. Secondary outcome measures were depression, 
sleep quality, mental flexibility and cognition, and physical fatigue. Niacin 
treatment was well-tolerated by forty-five subjects. The mean [95% CI] change in 
UPDRS III scores at six months of placebo was -0.05 [95% CI, -2.4 to 2.32], and 
niacin was -1.06 [95% CI, -3.68 to 1.57]. From six to twelve months when both 
groups received open-label niacin supplementation, the average UPDRS III scores 
significantly decreased for the placebo group by 4.58 [95% CI, -0.85 to 8.30] 
and the niacin group by 4.63 [95% CI, 1.42 to 7.83] points. Low-dose niacin 
supplementation is a well-tolerated adjunct therapy and may improve motor 
function in PD when taken over a longer period.
