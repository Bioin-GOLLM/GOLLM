There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using 
deep-learning methods1-9. Despite this progress, a general deep-learning 
framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design 
challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher-order symmetric 
architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models10,11 have had 
considerable success in image and language generative modelling but limited 
success when applied to protein modelling, probably due to the complexity of 
protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show 
that by fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein 
structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones 
that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained 
protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme 
active site scaffolding and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and 
metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the 
method, called RoseTTAFold diffusion (RFdiffusion), by experimentally 
characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of designed symmetric 
assemblies, metal-binding proteins and protein binders. The accuracy of 
RFdiffusion is confirmed by the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a 
designed binder in complex with influenza haemagglutinin that is nearly 
identical to the design model. In a manner analogous to networks that produce 
images from user-specified inputs, RFdiffusion enables the design of diverse 
functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.
