PTENP1 is a long non-coding RNA which has been regarded as a pseudogene of the 
PTEN tumor suppressor gene. However, it has been shown to be a biologically 
active transcript that can function as a competing endogenous RNA and enhance 
expression of PTEN protein. This lncRNA has two transcripts, namely PTENP1-202 
and PTENP1-202 with sizes of 3996 and 1215 bps, respectively. PTENP1 acts as a 
sponge for some PETN-targeting miRNAs, such as miR-17, miR-20a, miR-19b, 
miR-106b, miR-200c, miR-193a-3p, miR-499-5p and miR-214. Besides, it can affect 
miR-20a/PDCD4, miR-27a-3p/EGR1, miR-17-5p/SOCS6 and miR-19b/TSC1 axes. This long 
non-coding RNA participates in the pathoetiology of several types of cancers as 
well as non-malignant conditions such as alcohol-induced osteopenia, insulin 
resistance, osteoporosis, sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction and spinal cord 
injury. In the current review, we elucidate the role of PTENP1 in human 
disorders, particularly malignant conditions based on evidence acquired from 
cell line assays, animal studies and investigations on human samples.
