Liver steatosis without alcohol consumption, namely, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD), is a common hepatic condition that encompasses a wide spectrum 
of presentations, ranging from simple accumulation of triglycerides in the 
hepatocytes without any liver damage to inflammation, necrosis, ballooning, and 
fibrosis (namely, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) up to severe liver disease and 
eventually cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. The pathophysiology of 
fatty liver and its progression is influenced by multiple factors (environmental 
and genetics), in a "multiple parallel-hit model," in which oxidative stress 
plays a very likely primary role as the starting point of the hepatic and 
extrahepatic damage. The aim of this review is to give a comprehensive insight 
on the present researches and findings on the role of oxidative stress 
mechanisms in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of NAFLD. With this aim, we 
evaluated the available data in basic science and clinical studies in this 
field, reviewing the most recent works published on this topic.
