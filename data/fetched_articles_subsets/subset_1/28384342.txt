BACKGROUND: Our aim was to assess the influence of age, gender and lifestyle 
factors on the effect of the obesity-promoting alleles of FTO and MCR4.
METHODS: The HUNT study comprises health information on the population of 
Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. Extreme phenotype participants (gender-wise lower 
and upper quartiles of waist-hip-ratio and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) in the third survey, 
HUNT3 (2006-08), were genotyped for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
rs9939609 (FTO) and rs17782313 (MC4R); 25686 participants were successfully 
genotyped. Extreme sampling was chosen to increase power to detect genetic and 
gene-environment effects on waist-hip-ratio and BMI. Statistical inference was 
based on linear regression models and a missing-covariate likelihood approach 
for the extreme phenotype sampling design. Environmental factors were physical 
activity, diet (artificially sweetened beverages) and smoking. Longitudinal 
analysis was performed using material from HUNT2 (1995-97).
RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal genetic effects indicated stronger 
genetic associations with obesity in young than in old, as well as differences 
between women and men. We observed larger genetic effects among physically 
inactive compared to active individuals. This interaction was age-dependent and 
seen mainly in 20-40 year olds. We observed a greater FTO effect among men with 
a regular intake of artificially sweetened beverages, compared to non-drinkers. 
Interaction analysis of smoking was mainly inconclusive.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large all-adult and area-based population survey the effects 
of obesity-promoting minor-alleles of FTO and MCR4, and interactions with life 
style factors are age- and gender-related. These findings appear relevant when 
designing individualized treatment for and prophylaxis against obesity.
