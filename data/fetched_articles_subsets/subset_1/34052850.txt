STUDY QUESTION: Can any new genetic factors responsible for early embryonic 
arrest in infertile patients be identified, together with the mechanism of 
pathogenic variants?
SUMMARY ANSWER: We identified three homozygous variants in the F-box protein 43 
gene (FBXO43) in infertile patients and studies on the effects of the variants 
in HEK293T cells and mouse oocytes provided evidence for a causal relation 
between FBXO43 and female infertility.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: FBXO43, an inhibitor of the anaphase-promoting 
complex/cyclosome, mediates Metaphase II arrest as a component of the cytostatic 
factor in oocytes. Both male and female Fbxo43 knockout mice are viable but 
sterile. FBXO43, therefore, appears to be an essential component of the 
mammalian cell-cycle machinery that regulates both male and female meiosis. 
Until now, only one article has reported a homozygous FBXO43 variant associated 
with teratozoospermia, but the causal relationship was not established with 
functional evidence.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and homozygosity 
mapping were performed in 24 probands from consanguineous families who suffered 
from early embryonic arrest, and two different homozygous variants in FBXO43 
were identified in two independent families. WES data from a further 950 
infertile women with early embryonic arrest were screened for homozygous and 
compound heterozygous variants in FBXO43, and a third individual with an 
additional homozygous variant in FBXO43 was identified. The infertile patients 
presenting with early embryonic arrest were recruited from August 2016 to May 
2020.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The women diagnosed with primary 
infertility were recruited from the reproduction centers of local hospitals. 
Genomic DNA samples from the affected individuals, their family members, and 
healthy controls were extracted from peripheral blood. The FBXO43 variants were 
identified using WES, homozygosity mapping, in silico analysis, and variant 
screening. All of the variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and the 
effects of the variants were investigated in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T 
cells by western blotting and in mouse oocytes by complementary RNA injection.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We identified three homozygous variants in 
FBXO43 (NM_001029860.4)-namely, c.1490_1497dup (p.(Glu500Serfs*2)), c.1747C>T 
(p.(Gln583*)), and c.154delG (p.(Asp52Thrfs*30))-in three independent families. 
All of the homozygous variants reduced the protein level of FBXO43 and reduced 
the level of its downstream target Cyclin B1 in HEK293T cells. In addition, the 
variants reduced the ability of exogenous human FBXO43 to rescue the 
parthenogenetic activation phenotype in Fbxo43 knockdown mouse oocytes.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Owing to the lack of in vivo data from the 
oocytes of patients, the exact molecular mechanism remains unknown and should be 
further investigated using knock out or knock in mice.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study has identified three pathogenic 
variants in FBXO43 that are involved in human early embryonic arrest. These 
findings contribute to our understanding of the role of FBXO43 in human early 
embryonic development and provide a new genetic marker for female infertility.
