Experiments were done to show whether a G to T mis-sense mutation at the third 
base of codon 249 of the p53 tumour suppressor gene is a 'hot spot' of aflatoxin 
attack as suggested by the results of epidemiological studies. Liver tissue from 
liver cancer patients in Taiwan and Japan was analysed for the presence of 
aflatoxin-DNA adducts (ADA) as a marker for aflatoxin exposure and an AGG to AGT 
transversion at codon 249 of the p53 gene. Ten per cent of samples containing 
ADA, indicating definite exposure of the subjects to aflatoxin, was found to 
harbour the codon 249 mutation, whereas 18% of the samples with no detectable 
adducts also contained the mutation. Our data do not support the hypothesis that 
codon 249 of the p53 gene DNA is a hot spot for aflatoxin mutagenesis as a 'late 
stage event' in human hepatocellular carcinogenesis.
