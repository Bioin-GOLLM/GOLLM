CYP2C9, a drug-metabolizing enzyme, converts the angiotensin II receptor blocker 
losartan to its active form, which is responsible for its antihypertensive 
effect. We resequenced CYP2C9 in 724 Japanese individuals, including 39 
hypertensive patients under treatment with losartan. Of two novel missense 
mutations identified, the Arg132Gln variant showed a fivefold lower intrinsic 
clearance toward diclofenac when expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system, 
while the Arg335Gln variant had no substantial effect. Several known missense 
variations were also found, and approximately 7% of the Japanese individuals (53 
out of 724) carried one of the deleterious alleles (CYP2C9*3, *13, *14, *30, and 
Arg132Gln) as heterozygotes. After 3 months of losartan treatment, systolic 
blood pressure was not lowered in two patients with CYP2C9* 1/*30, suggesting 
that they exhibited impaired in vivo CYP2C9 activity. CYP2C9*30 might be 
associated with a diminished response to the antihypertensive effects of 
losartan.
