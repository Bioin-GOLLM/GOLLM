BACKGROUND: Nucleotide-specific 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) remains 
understudied in pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. 5hmC is abundant 
in the brain, and alterations to 5hmC in adult CNS tumors have been reported. 
However, traditional approaches to measure DNA methylation do not distinguish 
between 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its oxidized counterpart 5hmC, including 
those used to build CNS tumor DNA methylation classification systems. We 
measured 5hmC and 5mC epigenome-wide at nucleotide resolution in glioma, 
ependymoma, and embryonal tumors from children, as well as control pediatric 
brain tissues using tandem bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite treatments followed 
by hybridization to the Illumina Methylation EPIC Array that interrogates over 
860,000 CpG loci.
RESULTS: Linear mixed effects models adjusted for age and sex tested the 
CpG-specific differences in 5hmC between tumor and non-tumor samples, as well as 
between tumor subtypes. Results from model-based clustering of tumors was used 
to test the relation of cluster membership with patient survival through 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. We also assessed the 
robustness of multiple epigenetic CNS tumor classification methods to 
5mC-specific data in both pediatric and adult CNS tumors. Compared to non-tumor 
samples, tumors were hypohydroxymethylated across the epigenome and tumor 5hmC 
localized to regulatory elements crucial to cell identity, including 
transcription factor binding sites and super-enhancers. Differentially 
hydroxymethylated loci among tumor subtypes tended to be hypermethylated and 
disproportionally found in CTCF binding sites and genes related to 
posttranscriptional RNA regulation, such as DICER1. Model-based clustering 
results indicated that patients with low 5hmC patterns have poorer overall 
survival and increased risk of recurrence. Our results suggest 5mC-specific data 
from OxBS-treated samples impacts methylation-based tumor classification systems 
giving new opportunities for further refinement of classifiers for both 
pediatric and adult tumors.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified that 5hmC localizes to super-enhancers, and genes 
commonly implicated in pediatric CNS tumors were differentially 
hypohydroxymethylated. We demonstrated that distinguishing methylation and 
hydroxymethylation is critical in identifying tumor-related epigenetic changes. 
These results have implications for patient prognostication, considerations of 
epigenetic therapy in CNS tumors, and for emerging molecular neuropathology 
classification approaches.
