Low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue and liver has been implicated in 
obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Yet, the contribution 
of inflammatory cells to the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle insulin resistance 
remains elusive. In a large cohort of obese human individuals, blood monocyte 
Fas (CD95) expression correlated with systemic and skeletal muscle insulin 
resistance. To test a causal role for myeloid cell Fas expression in the 
development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance, we generated 
myeloid/haematopoietic cell-specific Fas-depleted mice. Myeloid/haematopoietic 
Fas deficiency prevented the development of glucose intolerance in high fat-fed 
mice, in ob/ob mice, and in mice acutely challenged by LPS. In vivo, ex vivo and 
in vitro studies demonstrated preservation of muscle insulin responsiveness with 
no effect on adipose tissue or liver. Studies using neutralizing antibodies 
demonstrated a role for TNFα as mediator between myeloid Fas and skeletal muscle 
insulin resistance, supported by significant correlations between monocyte Fas 
expression and circulating TNFα in humans. In conclusion, our results 
demonstrate an unanticipated crosstalk between myeloid cells and skeletal muscle 
in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.
