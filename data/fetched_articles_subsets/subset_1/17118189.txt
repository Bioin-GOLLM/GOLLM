BACKGROUND: A structured motif allows variable length gaps between several 
components, where each component is a simple motif, which allows either no gaps 
or only fixed length gaps. The motif can either be represented as a pattern or a 
profile (also called positional weight matrix). We propose an efficient 
algorithm, called SMOTIF, to solve the structured motif search problem, i.e., 
given one or more sequences and a structured motif, SMOTIF searches the 
sequences for all occurrences of the motif. Potential applications include 
searching for long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and composite 
regulatory binding sites in DNA sequences.
RESULTS: SMOTIF can search for both pattern and profile motifs, and it is 
efficient in terms of both time and space; it outperforms SMARTFINDER, a 
state-of-the-art algorithm for structured motif search. Experimental results 
show that SMOTIF is about 7 times faster and consumes 100 times less memory than 
SMARTFINDER. It can effectively search for LTR retrotransposons and is well 
suited to searching for motifs with long range gaps. It is also successful in 
finding potential composite transcription factor binding sites.
CONCLUSION: SMOTIF is a useful and efficient tool in searching for structured 
pattern and profile motifs. The algorithm is available as open-source at:
