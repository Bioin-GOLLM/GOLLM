In this study, the chemical profiles and antioxidant activities of red cabbage 
anthocyanin (RCA)-enriched extract are evaluated. The effects of column 
temperature on the HPLC resolution of the RCAs are studied. The HPLC resolutions 
became better as the column temperature increased from 20 °C⁻45 °C. An optimized 
HPLC condition was achieved at 45 °C and used for the quantification and 
qualification of the RCAs. The anthocyanins in the enriched powder are all 
derivatives of cyanidin (268 ± 2 μg/mg), mainly with 19% nonacylated, 51% 
monoacylated, and 31% diacylated structures with ferulic, sinapic, p-coumaric, 
and caffeic acids characterized by HPLC-MS. The RCA extracts markedly reduced 
intracellular oxidative stress production by H₂O₂ on HepG2 cells and 
consequently ameliorated cell apoptosis and improved viability. The analytical 
method and cellular antioxidant activity demonstration of the RCAs will greatly 
facilitate their functional applications.
