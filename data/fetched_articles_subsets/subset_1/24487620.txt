Hunger is a hard-wired motivational state essential for survival. Agouti-related 
peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) at the base of 
the hypothalamus are crucial to the control of hunger. They are activated by 
caloric deficiency and, when naturally or artificially stimulated, they potently 
induce intense hunger and subsequent food intake. Consistent with their 
obligatory role in regulating appetite, genetic ablation or chemogenetic 
inhibition of AgRP neurons decreases feeding. Excitatory input to AgRP neurons 
is important in caloric-deficiency-induced activation, and is notable for its 
remarkable degree of caloric-state-dependent synaptic plasticity. Despite the 
important role of excitatory input, its source(s) has been unknown. Here, 
through the use of Cre-recombinase-enabled, cell-specific neuron mapping 
techniques in mice, we have discovered strong excitatory drive that, 
unexpectedly, emanates from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, 
specifically from subsets of neurons expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone 
(TRH) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, also known 
as ADCYAP1). Chemogenetic stimulation of these afferent neurons in sated mice 
markedly activates AgRP neurons and induces intense feeding. Conversely, acute 
inhibition in mice with caloric-deficiency-induced hunger decreases feeding. 
Discovery of these afferent neurons capable of triggering hunger advances 
understanding of how this intense motivational state is regulated.
