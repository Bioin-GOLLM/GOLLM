BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
(SNP) in the CACAN1C gene, rs1006737, is related to different mood disorder 
illnesses, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Current day molecular 
procedures for allele detection of this gene can be very expensive and time 
consuming. Hence, a sensitive and specific molecular procedure for detecting 
these mutations in a large number of subjects is desirable, especially for 
research groups who have no complex laboratory equipment.
OBJECTIVE: The possibility of using a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer 
(FRET) probe was evaluated by means of bioinformatic tools, designed for 
forecasting the molecular behavior of DNA probes used in the research field or 
for laboratory analysis methods.
METHOD: In this study we used the DINAMelt Web Server to predict the Tms of FRET 
oligo in the presence of the A and/or G allele in rs1006737. The PCR primers 
were designed by using oligo 4 and oligo 6 primer analysis software.
RESULTS: The molecular probe described in this study detected a Tm difference of 
5-6°C between alleles A and G in rs1006737, which also showed good 
discrimination for a heterozygous profile for this genomic region.
CONCLUSION: Although in silico studies represent a relatively new avenue of 
inquiry, they have now started to be used to predict how a molecular probe 
interacts with its biological target, reducing the time and costs of molecular 
test tuning. The results of this study seem promising for further laboratory 
tests on allele detection in rs1006737 region.
