Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly emerged 
coronavirus that infected more than 8000 individuals and resulted in more than 
800 (10-15%) fatalities in 2003. The causative agent of SARS has been identified 
as a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and its viral protease, SARS-CoV 
3CL(pro), has been shown to be essential for replication and has hence been 
recognized as a potent drug target for SARS infection. Currently, there is no 
effective treatment for this epidemic despite the intensive research that has 
been undertaken since 2003 (over 3500 publications). This perspective focuses on 
the status of various efficacious anti-SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) chemotherapies 
discovered during the last 12 years (2003-2015) from all sources, including 
laboratory synthetic methods, natural products, and virtual screening. We 
describe here mainly peptidomimetic and small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV 
3CL(pro). Attempts have been made to provide a complete description of the 
structural features and binding modes of these inhibitors under many conditions.
