BACKGROUND: Gastric adenomatous proximal polyposis syndrome (GAPPS) is a 
recently described, rare, autosomal dominant condition characterized by the 
extensive involvement of the proximal stomach with hundreds of heterogeneous 
fundic gland polyps with antral and duodenal sparing. GAPPS is caused by a point 
mutation of the APC gene promoter 1B and is associated with a risk of malignant 
transformation, distant metastasis, and death. There are no surveillance, 
screening, or treatment guidelines for managing GAPPS. The few reported cases 
have been variably managed with endoscopic surveillance or prophylactic 
gastrectomy. However, there is no consensus on the optimal management approach.
SUMMARY: In this case series, we review the relevant literature on GAPPS and 
present two siblings who underwent early prophylactic total gastrectomies with 
good outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Due to the poor correlation between the endoscopic findings on 
sampled polyps and the risk of harboring invasive gastric cancer, patients with 
GAPPS should be strongly considered for early prophylactic total gastrectomies 
in the absence of prohibitive comorbidities.
