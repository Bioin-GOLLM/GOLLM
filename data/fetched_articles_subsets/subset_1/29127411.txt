The influence of (nickel nitrate/citric acid) mole ratio on the formation of 
sol-gel end products was examined. The formed Ni/NiO nanoparticle was anchored 
on to reduced graphene-oxide (rGO) by means of probe sonication. It was found 
that the sample obtained from the (1:1) nickel ion: citric acid (Ni2+: CA) mole 
ratio resulted in a high specific capacity of 158 C/g among all (Ni2+: CA) 
ratios examined. By anchoring Ni/NiO on to the rGO resulted in enhanced specific 
capacity of as high as 335 C/g along with improved cycling stability, high rate 
capability and Coulombic efficiency. The high conductivity and increased surface 
area seemed responsible for enhanced electrochemical performances of the 
Ni/NiO@rGO nanocomposite. A solid-state hybrid energy-storage device consisting 
of the Ni/NiO@rGO (NR2) as a positive electrode and the rGO as negative 
electrode exhibited enhanced energy and power densities. Lighting of LED was 
demonstrated by using three proto-type (NR2(+)|| rGO(-)) hybrid devices 
connected in series.
