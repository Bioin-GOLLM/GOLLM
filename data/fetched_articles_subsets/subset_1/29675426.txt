Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
and the pathogenesis of AD is poorly understood. G protein-coupled receptors 
(GPCRs) are involved in numerous key AD pathways and play a key role in the 
pathology of AD. To fully understand the pathogenesis of AD and design novel 
drug therapeutics, analyzing the connection between AD and GPCRs is of great 
importance. In this paper, we firstly build and analyze the AD-related pathway 
by consulting the KEGG pathway of AD and a mass of literature and collect 25 
AD-related GPCRs for drug discovery. Then the ILbind and AutoDock Vina tools are 
integrated to find out potential drugs related to AD. According to the analysis 
of DUD-E dataset, we select five drugs, that is, Acarbose (ACR), Carvedilol 
(CVD), Digoxin (DGX), NADH (NAI), and Telmisartan (TLS), by sorting the ILbind 
scores (â‰¥0.73). Then depending on their AutoDock Vina scores and pocket position 
information, the binding patterns of these five drugs are obtained. We analyze 
the regulation function of GPCRs in the metabolic network of AD based on the 
drug screen results, which may be helpful for the study of the off-target effect 
and the side effect of drugs.
