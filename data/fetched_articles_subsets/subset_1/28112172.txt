The soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors 
(SNAREs) constitute the core machinery for membrane fusion during eukaryotic 
cell vesicular trafficking. However, how the assembly of the SNARE complex is 
initiated is unknown. Here we report that Sec3, a component of the exocyst 
complex that mediates vesicle tethering during exocytosis, directly interacts 
with the t-SNARE protein Sso2. This interaction promotes the formation of an 
Sso2-Sec9 'binary' t-SNARE complex, the early rate-limiting step in SNARE 
complex assembly, and stimulates membrane fusion. The crystal structure of the 
Sec3-Sso2 complex suggests that Sec3 binding induces conformational changes of 
Sso2 that are crucial for the relief of its auto-inhibition. Interestingly, 
specific disruption of the Sec3-Sso2 interaction in cells blocks exocytosis 
without affecting the function of Sec3 in vesicle tethering. Our study reveals 
an activation mechanism for SNARE complex assembly, and uncovers a role of the 
exocyst in promoting membrane fusion in addition to vesicle tethering.
