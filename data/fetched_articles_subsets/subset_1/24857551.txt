Quiescence (G0) allows cycling cells to reversibly cease proliferation. A 
decision to enter quiescence is suspected of occurring early in G1, before the 
restriction point (R). Surprisingly, we have identified G2 as an interval during 
which inhibition of the protein phosphatase PP2A results in failure to exhibit 
stable quiescence. This effect is accompanied by shortening of the ensuing G1. 
The PP2A subcomplex required for stable G0 contains the B56γ B subunit. After 
PP2A inhibition in G2, aberrant overexpression of cyclin E occurs during mitosis 
and is responsible for overriding quiescence. Strikingly, suppression of Ras 
signaling re-establishes normal cyclin E levels during M and restores G0. These 
data point to PP2A-B56γ-driven Ras signaling modulation in G2 as essential for 
suppressing aberrant cyclin E expression during mitosis and thereby achieving 
normal G0 control. Thus, G2 is an interval during which the length and growth 
factor dependence of the next G1 interval are established.
