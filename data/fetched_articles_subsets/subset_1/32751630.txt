The aim of this review article is to introduce the reader to the 
state-of-the-art of the contribution that proteomics and metabolomics sciences 
are currently providing for cystic fibrosis (CF) research: from the 
understanding of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 
biology to biomarker discovery for CF diagnosis. Our work particularly focuses 
on CFTR post-translational modifications and their role in cellular trafficking 
as well as on studies that allowed the identification of CFTR molecular 
interactors. We also show how metabolomics is currently helping biomarker 
discovery in CF. The most recent advances in these fields are covered by this 
review, as well as some considerations on possible future scenarios for new 
applications.
