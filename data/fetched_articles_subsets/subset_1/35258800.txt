The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells have been used for decades as a cell-based 
model of dopaminergic neurons to explore the underlying science of cellular and 
molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, 
data revealing the protein expression changes in 6-OHDA induced cytotoxicity in 
differentiated SH-SY5Y cells remain void. Therefore, we investigated the 
differentially regulated proteins expressed in terminally differentiated SH-SY5Y 
cells (differ-SH-SY5Y neural cells) exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) using 
the LC-MS/MS technology and construed the data using the online bioinformatics 
databases such as PANTHER, STRING, and KEGG. Our studies demonstrated that the 
neuronal development in differ-SH-SY5Y neural cells was indicated by the 
overexpression of proteins responsible for neurite formations such as calnexin 
(CANX) and calreticulin (CALR) besides significant downregulation of ribosomal 
proteins. The enrichment of the KEGG ribosome pathway was detected with 
significant downregulation (p < 0.05) of all the 21 ribosomal proteins in 
differ-SH-SY5Y neural cells compared with undifferentiated cells. Whereas in the 
PD model, the pathological changes induced by 6-OHDA were indicated by the 
presence of unfolded and misfolded proteins, which triggered the response of 
10 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP), namely HSPE1 and HSPA9. Moreover, the 
6-OHDA-induced neurodegeneration in differ-SH-SY5Y neural cells also upregulated 
the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) protein and 
enriched the KEGG systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathway that was regulated 
by 17 histone proteins (p < 0.05) in differ-SH-SY5Y neural cells. These results 
suggest that the nucleosomal degradation pathway may have regulated the 6-OHDA 
induced neurodegeneration in PD cell-based model, which is reflected by 
increased apoptosis and histone release in differ-SH-SY5Y neural cells.
