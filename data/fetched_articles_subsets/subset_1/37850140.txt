The site-specific incorporation of the noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) into 
proteins via genetic code expansion (GCE) has enabled the development of new and 
powerful ways to learn, regulate, and evolve biological functions in vivo. 
However, cellular biosynthesis of ncAA-containing proteins with high efficiency 
and fidelity is a formidable challenge. In this review, we summarize up-to-date 
progress towards improving the efficiency and orthogonality of GCE and enhancing 
intracellular compatibility of introduced translation machinery in the living 
cells by creation and optimization of orthogonal translation components, 
constructing genomically recoded organism (GRO), utilization of unnatural base 
pairs (UBP) and quadruplet codons (four-base codons), and spatial separation of 
orthogonal translation.
