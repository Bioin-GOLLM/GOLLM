BACKGROUND: Pre-mRNA processing factor 19 (PRPF19) is an E3 ligase that plays a 
crucial role in repairing tumor-damaged cells and promoting cell survival. 
However, the predictive value and biological function of PRPF19 in bladder 
urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) require further investigation.
METHODS: In this study, we utilized transcriptomic data and bladder cancer 
tissue microarrays to identify the high expression of PRPF19 in BLCA, suggesting 
its potential as a prognostic biomarker. To gain a better understanding of the 
role of PRPF19 in the immune microenvironment of BLCA, we performed single cell 
analysis and employed the LASSO method. Additionally, we examined the 
methylation profiles of PRPF19 using the SMART website. Our investigation 
confirmed the correlation between PRPF19 and BLCA cell senescence and stemness. 
Furthermore, we constructed a PRPF19-miR-125a-5p-LINC02693-MIR4435-2HG ceRNA 
network using the ENCORI and miRWALK databases.
RESULTS: Our comprehensive analysis reveals that PRPF19 can serve as a 
prognostic marker for BLCA and is significantly associated with various 
immune-infiltrating cells in BLCA. Moreover, our findings suggest that PRPF19 
influences cellular senescence through the regulation of stemness. Finally, we 
developed a ceRNA network that has the potential to predict the prognosis of 
BLCA patients.
CONCLUSION: We confirmed the prognostic value and multiple biological functions 
of PRPF19 in BLCA. Furthermore, the specific ceRNA network can be used as a 
potential therapeutic target for BLCA.
