Histone acetylation is a key histone post-translational modification that shapes 
chromatin structure, dynamics, and function. Bromodomain (BRD) proteins, the 
readers of acetyl-lysines, are located in the center of the histone 
acetylation-signaling network. How they regulate DNA repair and genome stability 
remains poorly understood. Here, a conserved function of the yeast Bromodomain 
Factor 1 (Bdf1) and its human counterpart TAF1 is reported in promoting DNA 
double-stranded break repair by homologous recombination (HR). Depletion of 
either yeast BDF1 or human TAF1, or disruption of their BRDs impairs DNA end 
resection, Replication Protein A (RPA) and Rad51 loading, and HR repair, causing 
genome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Mechanistically, it is 
shown that Bdf1 preferentially binds the DNA damage-induced histone H4 
acetylation (H4Ac) via the BRD motifs, leading to its chromatin recruitment. 
Meanwhile, Bdf1 physically interacts with RPA, and this interaction facilitates 
RPA loading in the chromatin context and the subsequent HR repair. Similarly, 
TAF1 also interacts with H4Ac or RPA. Thus, Bdf1 and TAF1 appear to share a 
conserved mechanism in linking the HR repair to chromatin acetylation in 
preserving genome integrity.
