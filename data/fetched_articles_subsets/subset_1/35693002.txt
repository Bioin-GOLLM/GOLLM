Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a demyelinating disease in 
which pathogenesis T cells have a major role. Despite the unknown etiology, 
several risk factors have been described, including a strong association with 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Recent findings showed that HLA class I-G 
(HLA-G) may be tolerogenic in MS, but further insights are required. To deepen 
the HLA-G role in MS inflammation, we measured soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) and 
cytokines serum level in 27 patients with RRMS at baseline and after 12 and 24 
months of natalizumab (NTZ) treatment. Patients were divided into high 
(sHLA-G>20 ng/ml), medium (sHLA-G between 10 and 20 ng/ml), and low (sHLA-G <10 
ng/ml) producers. Results showed a heterogeneous distribution of genotypes among 
producers, with no significant differences between groups. A significant 
decrease of sHLA-G was found after 24 months of NTZ in low producers carrying 
the +3142 C/G genotype. Finally, 83.3% of high and 100% of medium producers were 
MRI-activity free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 63.5% of low 
producers. Of note, we did not find any correlation of sHLA-G with peripheral 
cell counts or cytokines level. These findings suggest that serum sHLA-G level 
may partly depend on genotype rather than peripheral inflammation, and that may 
have impacted on MRI activity of patients over treatment.
