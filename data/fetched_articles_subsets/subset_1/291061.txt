Human cell lines expressing intestinal alkaline phosphatase.

Benham FJ, Harris H.

At least three loci determine human alkaline phosphatases 
[orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (alkaline optimum), EC 3.1.3.1]: one 
coding for the placental form of the enzyme, at least one coding for the 
intestinal forms, and at least one for the liver, bone, and kidney forms. The 
alkaline phosphatase in cell line D98/AH-2 has been characterized by inhibition, 
thermostability, and electrophoretic studies. It is intestinal in type and 
resembles the fetal intestinal form somewhat more closely than the adult 
intestinal form. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase was found in the related cell 
lines Detroit 98, D98/S, and D98/AH-R. No placental alkaline phosphatase could 
be detected in any of these cell lines. This series of cell lines are believed, 
on the basis of earlier investigations, to be HeLa in origin but other HeLa cell 
lines show placental alkaline phosphatase. Loss of expression of the placental 
alkaline phosphatase locus probably occurred prior to the separation of 
Detroit-98 from the lineage leading to other HeLa cell lines and this has 
persisted in the Detroit-98 derivatives D98/AH-2, D98/S, and D98/AH-R. Another 
possibility is that placental alkaline phosphatase expression only appeared in 
the HeLa lineage subsequent to the separation of Detroit-98.
