Bovine aorta actin. Development of an improved purification procedure and 
comparison of polymerization properties with actins from other types of muscle.

Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H, Zmorzyński S, Mossakowska M.

Crude actin extracts from acetone-dried powder of the muscle layer of bovine 
aorta contain an actin-modulating protein which promotes nucleation of actin 
monomers and decreases the average length of actin filaments in a Ca2+-dependent 
manner. This observation has allowed the development of an improved purification 
procedure for aorta actin which increases the yield 2- to 3-times. The actin 
obtained with this procedure consists of 77% alpha- and 23% gamma-isoelectric 
species. Pure aorta actin is indistinguishable from actins from skeletal, 
cardiac and chicken-gizzard smooth muscle in its polymerization rate, critical 
concentration, and reduced viscosity when polymerized with KCl at 25 degrees C. 
It differs from sarcomeric actins, but not from chicken-gizzard smooth muscle 
actin, in the temperature dependence of polymerization equilibria in KCl. This 
difference correlates with the amino acid replacements Val-17----Cys-17 and 
Thr-89----Ser-89, supporting a conclusion drawn from other studies that the 
N-terminal portion of actin polypeptide chain contains sites important for 
polymerization.
