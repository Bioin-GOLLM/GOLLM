Juglanthraquinone C (JC), a naturally occurring anthraquinone extracted from 
Juglans mandshurica, could induce apoptosis of cancer cells. This study aims to 
investigate the detailed cytotoxicity mechanism of JC in HepG2 and BEL-7402 
cells. The Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were first used to analyze the 
mRNA expression exposed to JC or DMSO in HepG2 cells. Consistent with the 
previous results, the data indicated that JC could induce apoptosis and 
hyperactivated Akt. The Western blot analysis further revealed that Akt, a 
well-known survival protein, was strongly activated in HepG2 and BEL-7402 cells. 
Furthermore, an obvious inhibitory effect on JC-induced apoptosis was observed 
when the Akt levels were decreased, while the overexpression of constitutively 
active mutant Akt greatly accelerated JC-induced apoptosis. The subsequent 
results suggested that JC treatment suppressed nuclear localization and 
increased phosphorylated levels of Foxo3a, and the overexpression of Foxo3a 
abrogated JC-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, the inactivation of Foxo3a 
induced by JC further led to an increase of intracellular ROS levels by 
suppressing ROS scavenging enzymes, and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and 
catalase successfully decreased JC-induced apoptosis. Collectively, this study 
demonstrated that JC induced the apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
cells by activating Akt/Foxo signaling pathway and increasing intracellular ROS 
levels.
