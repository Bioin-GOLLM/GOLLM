The objective of this peripheral nerve stimulation consensus guideline is to add 
to the current family of consensus practice guidelines and incorporate a 
systematic review process. The published literature was searched from relevant 
electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from database inception to March 29, 2021. 
Inclusion criteria encompassed studies that described peripheral nerve 
stimulation in patients in terms of clinical outcomes for various pain 
conditions, physiological mechanism of action, surgical technique, technique of 
placement, and adverse events. Twenty randomized controlled trials and 33 
prospective observational studies were included in the systematic review 
process. There is Level I evidence supporting the efficacy of PNS for treatment 
of chronic migraine headaches via occipital nerve stimulation; chronic 
hemiplegic shoulder pain via stimulation of nerves innervating the trapezius, 
supraspinatus, and deltoid muscles; failed back surgery syndrome via 
subcutaneous peripheral field stimulation; and lower extremity neuropathic and 
lower extremity post-amputation pain. Evidence from current Level I studies 
combined with newer technologies facilitating less invasive and easier electrode 
placement make peripheral nerve stimulation an attractive alternative for 
managing patients with complex pain disorders. Peripheral nerve stimulation 
should be used judiciously as an adjunct for chronic and acute postoperative 
pain following adequate patient screening and positive diagnostic nerve block or 
stimulation trial.
