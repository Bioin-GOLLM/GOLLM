Flux balance analysis (FBA) is an increasingly useful approach for modeling the 
behavior of metabolic systems. However, standard FBA modeling of genetic 
knockouts cannot predict drug combination synergies observed between serial 
metabolic targets, even though such synergies give rise to some of the most 
widely used antibiotic treatments. Here we extend FBA modeling to simulate 
responses to chemical inhibitors at varying concentrations, by diverting 
enzymatic flux to a waste reaction. This flux diversion yields very similar 
qualitative predictions to prior methods for single target activity. However, we 
find very different predictions for combinations, where flux diversion, which 
mimics the kinetics of competitive metabolic inhibitors, can explain serial 
target synergies between metabolic enzyme inhibitors that we confirmed in 
Escherichia coli cultures. FBA flux diversion opens the possibility for more 
accurate genome-scale predictions of drug synergies, which can be used to 
suggest treatments for infections and other diseases.
