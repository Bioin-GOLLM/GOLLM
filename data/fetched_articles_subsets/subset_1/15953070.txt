Identification of mutations in the hairless (HR) gene in patients with atrichia 
with papular lesions (APL) has proven of critical importance, as it provides a 
basis for the differentiation between APL and alopecia universalis. The 
establishment of the diagnostic criteria for APL has triggered the 
identification of a large number of APL patients among those suspected to suffer 
from alopecia universalis. This advancement has resulted in the discovery of an 
increasing number of hairless mutations in both consanguineous and 
nonconsanguineous APL families. Here, we report the identification of a 
homozygous mutation, 3434delC, in an APL patient of Arab-Palestinian descent. 
The proband is a 23-year-old female with generalized scalp and body alopecia. To 
confirm the diagnosis of APL and to identify the specific mutation, we sequenced 
the hairless gene. Sequencing of all exons of the hairless gene revealed a 
homozygous frameshift mutation, 3434delC, in exon 18. Interestingly, the same 
mutation was previously identified in an Arab-Israeli family. Our data suggest 
that the 3434delC mutation most likely represents a founder mutation in this 
geographical region.
