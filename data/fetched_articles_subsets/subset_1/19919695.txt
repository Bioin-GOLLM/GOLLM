BACKGROUND: Proteolytic enzymes play central role in the biochemical mechanism 
of germination and intricately involved in many aspects of plant physiology and 
development. To study the mechanism of protein mobilization, undertaken the task 
of purifying and characterizing proteases, which occur transiently in 
germinating seeds of horse gram.
RESULTS: Cysteine protease (CPRHG) was purified to homogeneity with 118 fold by 
four step procedure comprising Crude extract, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, 
DEAE-Cellulose and CM-sephacel chromatography from the 2 day germinating 
cotyledons of horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdc.). CPRHG is a 
monomer with molecular mass of 30 k Da, was determined by SDS-PAGE and gel 
filtration. The purified enzyme on IEF showed two isoforms having pI values of 
5.85 and 6.1. CPRHG composed of high content of aspartic acid, glutamic acid and 
serine. The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by pCMB, iodoacetate and 
DEPC indicating cysteine and histidine residues at the active site. However, on 
addition of sulfhydryl reagents (cysteine, dithiothreitol, glutathione and 
beta-ME) reverse the strong inhibition by pCMB. The enzyme is fairly stable 
toward pH and temperature. Immunoblot analysis shows that the enzyme synthesized 
as zymogen (preproenzyme with 81 kDa) and processed to a 40 kDa proenzyme which 
was further degraded to give 30 kDa active enzyme.
CONCLUSION: It appears that the newly synthesized protease is inactive, and 
activation takes place during germination. CPRHG has a broad substrate 
specificity and stability in pH, temperature, etc. therefore, this protease may 
turn out to be an efficient choice for the pharmaceutical, medicinal, food, and 
biotechnology industry.
