The present study highlighted the aromatic-participant interactions in in vivo 
trimerization of HSF1 and got an insight into the process of HSF1 protecting 
against apoptosis. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), mutations of mouse 
HSF1 (W37A, Y60A and F104A) resulted in a loss of trimerization activity, 
impaired binding of the heat shock element (HSE) and lack of heat shock protein 
70 (HSP70) expression after a heat shock. Under UV irradiation, wild-type mouse 
HSF1 protected the MEFs from UV-induced apoptosis, but none of the mutants 
offered protection. We found that normal expression of HSF1 was essential to the 
cell arrest in G2 phase, assisting with the cell cycle checkpoint. The cells 
that lack normal HSF1 failed to arrest in the G2 phase, resulting in the process 
of cell apoptosis. We conclude that the treatment with UV or heat shock stresses 
appears to induce the approach of HSF1 monomers directly via 
aromatic-participant interactions, followed by the formation of a HSF1 trimer. 
HSF1 protects the MEFs from the stresses through the expression of HSPs and a G2 
cell cycle arrest.
