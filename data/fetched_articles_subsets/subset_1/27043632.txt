Radiation therapy (RT) is frequently used as part of the standard of care 
treatment of the majority of brain tumors. The efficacy of RT is limited by 
radioresistance and by normal tissue radiation tolerance. This is highlighted in 
pediatric brain tumors where the use of radiation is limited by the excessive 
toxicity to the developing brain. For these reasons, radiosensitization of tumor 
cells would be beneficial. In this review, we focus on radioresistance 
mechanisms intrinsic to tumor cells. We also evaluate existing approaches to 
induce radiosensitization and explore future avenues of investigation.
