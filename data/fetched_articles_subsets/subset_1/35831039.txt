INTRODUCTION: Delirium is a complex condition in which altered mental state and 
cognition causes severe distress and poor clinical outcomes for patients and 
families, anxiety and stress for the health professionals and support staff 
providing care, and higher care costs. Hospice patients are at high risk of 
developing delirium, but there is significant variation in care delivery. The 
primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of an 
implementation strategy (designed to help deliver good practice delirium 
guidelines), participant recruitment and data collection.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Three work packages in three hospices in the UK with 
public involvement in codesign, study management and stakeholder groups: (1) 
experience-based codesign to adapt an existing theoretically-informed 
implementation strategy (Creating Learning Environments for Compassionate Care 
(CLECC)) to implement delirium guidelines in hospices; (2) feasibility study to 
explore ability to collect demographic, diagnostic and delirium management data 
from clinical records (n=300), explanatory process data (number of staff engaged 
in CLECC activities and reasons for non-engagement) and cost data (staff and 
volunteer hours and pay-grades engaged in implementation activities) and (3) 
realist process evaluation to assess the acceptability and flexibility of the 
implementation strategy (preimplementation and postimplementation surveys with 
hospice staff and management, n=30 at each time point; interviews with hospice 
staff and management, n=15). Descriptive statistics, rapid thematic analysis and 
a realist logic of analysis will be used be used to analyse quantitative and 
qualitative data, as appropriate.
