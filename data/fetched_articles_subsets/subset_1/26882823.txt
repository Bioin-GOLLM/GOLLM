Molecular Characterization of a Novel Missense Mutation (Asp538Asn) in a Chinese 
Patient with Factor XII Deficiency.

BACKGROUND: Congenital factor XII (FXH) deficiency is an autosomal recessive 
disorder whose genetic basis has been described in a relatively small number of 
cases.
METHODS: Recently, we studied a Chinese family in which the proband had 
obviously prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) associated with 
low functional and antigen FXII levels, 5% and 6.8%, respectively. To 
investigate the molecular defects in this FXII-deficient patient, we performed 
FXII mutation screening and invitro expression studies.
RESULTS: Sequence analysis of the FXII gene revealed a heterozygous G>A 
transition at nucleotide 8597 in exon 13, causing a novel Asp538Asn mutation in 
the catalytic domain.
CONCLUSIONS: From the results above, we reasoned that this mutation must confer 
a cross-reacting material (CRM) negative phenotype. Additional expression 
studies in COS-7 cells showed that the antigen level of mutant FXII 
(FXII-Asp538Asn) was lower compared to the wild type in culture media, whereas 
the corresponding level of FXII antigen in cell lysates was equivalent roughly 
to that of the wild type. These findings indicated that the Asp538Asn mutation 
results in intracellular degradation of the mutant FXII and causes FXII 
deficiency.
