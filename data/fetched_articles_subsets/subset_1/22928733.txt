Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) catalyze the hydration of CO(2) forming HCO(3)(-) and 
a proton, an important reaction for many physiological processes including 
respiration, fluid secretion, and pH regulation. As such, CA isoforms are 
prominent clinical targets for treating various diseases. The clinically used 
acetazolamide (AZM) is a sulfonamide that binds with high affinity to human CA 
isoform II (HCA II). There are several X-ray structures available of AZM bound 
to various CA isoforms, but these complexes do not show the charged state of AZM 
or the hydrogen atom positions of the protein and solvent. Neutron diffraction 
is a useful technique for directly observing H atoms and the mapping of 
H-bonding networks that can greatly contribute to rational drug design. To this 
end, the neutron structure of H/D exchanged HCA II crystals in complex with AZM 
was determined. The structure reveals the molecular details of AZM binding and 
the charged state of the bound drug. This represents the first determined 
neutron structure of a clinically used drug bound to its target.
