BACKGROUND: Liver carcinoma generally presents as an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment that promotes tumor evasion. The intercellular crosstalk of 
immune cells significantly influences the construction of an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment. This study aimed to investigate the important interactions 
between immune cells and their targeting drugs in liver carcinoma, by using 
single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data.
METHODS: Single-cell and bulk transcriptomic data were retrieved from Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GSE159977, GSE136103, and GSE125449) and The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TGCA-LIHC), respectively. Quality control, dimension reduction, 
clustering, and annotation were performed according to the Scanpy workflow based 
on Python. Cell-cell interactions were explored using the CellPhone database and 
CellChat. Trajectory analysis was executed using a partition-based graph 
abstraction method. The transcriptomic factors (TFs) were predicted using 
single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC). The target 
genes from TFs were used to establish a related score based on the TCGA cohort; 
this score was subsequently validated by survival, gene set enrichment, and 
immune cell infiltration analyses. Drug prediction was performed based on the 
Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal and PRISM Repurposing datasets.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients at four different states, including health, 
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cancer, were enrolled in this study. After dimension 
reduction and clustering, twenty-two clusters were identified. Cell-cell 
interaction analyses indicated that macrophage-naive CD4 + T cell interaction 
significantly affect cancerous state. In brief, macrophages interact with naive 
CD4 + T cells via different pathways in different states. The results of 
SCENIC indicated that macrophages present in cancer cells were similar to those 
present during cirrhosis. A macrophage-naive CD4 + T cell (MNT) score was 
generated by the SCENIC-derived target genes. Based on the MNT score, five 
relevant drugs (inhibitor of polo-like kinase 1, inhibitor of kinesin family 
member 11, dabrafenib, ispinesib, and epothilone-b) were predicted.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the crucial role of macrophage-naive CD4 + T 
cell interaction in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of liver carcinoma. 
Tumor-associated macrophages may be derived from cirrhosis and can initiate 
liver carcinoma. Predictive drugs that target the macrophage-naive CD4 + T cell 
interaction may help to improve the immunosuppressive microenvironment and 
prevent immune evasion. The relevant mechanisms need to be further validated in 
experiments and cohort studies.
