BACKGROUND: More than two billion people have been exposed to hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) worldwide. Furthermore, four hundred million of them are infected with 
chronic HBV infection. The predominant mutation of the precore region involves a 
G to A change at nucleotide1896, which creates a premature stop codon at codon 
28. Two mutations of A1762T and G1764A are reported as the most prevalent 
mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP).
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship 
between mutations in precore (PC) and basal core promoter regions, and the viral 
load.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty serum samples from patients with hepatitis B were 
used. Levels of liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) were measured at the same time of serological markers of 
hepatitis B by ELISA. HBV-DNA was extracted from the sera, and then PCR 
performed on the HBV-DNA extracted with the use of specific primer of gene C. 
HBV viral load was determined by real-time PCR. The PC/ BCP mutations were 
determined by applying Line Probe Assay technique. The data were analyzed using 
SPSS software, version 20.
RESULTS: Only 82% of the patients were HBeAb positive and 76% of the patients 
had basal core/ precore mutations and mean viral load was 3/7 × 106 ± 9/7 × 105 
IU/ml. Prevalence of mutations in the precore and basal core promoter regions 
were 46% and 30%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that there is a statistically significant 
relationship between HBV viral load and mutations in precore region (P < 0.05).
