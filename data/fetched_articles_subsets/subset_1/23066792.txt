Over the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged from population-based 
studies to suggest that AF is a heritable disease. More recently, we have begun 
to elucidate the genetic substrate underlying AF. Genome-wide association 
studies (GWAS) have led to the identification of multiple risk loci that confer 
increased susceptibility to the arrhythmia. These loci harbor intriguing 
candidate genes including those encoding ion channels, transcription factors, 
and signaling molecules. Current efforts are ongoing to functionally validate 
the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis. In the future, novel genotyping 
technologies such as exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing promise to 
uncover a greater proportion of the heritability underlying AF. In this article 
we review recent advances in AF genetics research and discuss future 
developments in the field.
