CRISPR/Cas systems are widely used to knock out genes by inducing indel 
mutations, which are prone to genetic compensation. Complex genome modifications 
such as knockin (KI) might bypass compensation, though difficult to practice due 
to low efficiency. Moreover, no 'two-in-one' KI strategy combining conditional 
knockout (CKO) with fluorescent gene-labeling or further allele-labeling has 
been reported. Here, we developed a dual-cassette-donor strategy and achieved 
one-step and efficient generation of dual-function KI alleles at tbx5a and 
kctd10 loci in zebrafish via targeted insertion. These alleles display 
fluorescent gene-tagging and CKO effects before and after Cre induction, 
respectively. By introducing a second fluorescent reporter, geno-tagging effects 
were achieved at tbx5a and sox10 loci, exhibiting CKO coupled with fluorescent 
reporter switch upon Cre induction, enabling tracing of three distinct 
genotypes. We found that LiCl purification of gRNA is critical for highly 
efficient KI, and preselection of founders allows the efficient germline 
recovery of KI events.
