Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of natural molecules and a crucial 
factor in the biochemical reactions of living cells and organisms. Recently, 
researchers have successfully introduced chiral molecules to the surfaces of 
nanomaterials, creating chiral nanomaterials that exhibit an upscaling of chiral 
behavior from the molecular scale to the nanoscale. These chiral nanomaterials 
can selectively induce autophagy, apoptosis, and photothermal ablation in tumor 
cells based on their chirality, making them promising for application in 
anti-tumor therapy. However, these interesting and important phenomena have 
hitherto received little attention. Accordingly, we herein present a review of 
recent research progress in the field of chiral nanomaterials for tumor therapy 
along with brief looks at the mechanistic details of their actions. Finally, the 
current challenges and future perspectives of chiral nanomaterials in terms of 
maximizing their potential in tumor therapy are discussed. Thus, this review 
provides a helpful introduction to the design of chiral nanomaterials and will 
hopefully highlight the importance of chirality in tumor therapy.
