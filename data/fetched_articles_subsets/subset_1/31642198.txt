BACKGROUND: Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer (FNMTC) accounts for 
approximately 3%-9% of all thyroid cancers; however, the mechanisms underlying 
FNMTC remain unclear. Environmental and genetic (especially genetic mutation) 
factors may play important roles in FNMTC etiology, development, and 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: Three affected members, including two first-degree relatives, and three 
healthy members of a family with FNMTC were studied. We performed whole-exome 
and targeted gene sequencing to identify gene mutations that may be associated 
with FNMTC pathogenesis. The results were analyzed using Exome Aggregation 
Consortium data and the Genome Aggregation Database and further validated using 
Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: Of 28 pivotal genes with rare nonsynonymous mutations found, 7 were 
identified as novel candidate FNMTC pathogenic genes (ANO7, CAV2, KANK1, PIK3CB, 
PKD1L1, PTPRF, and RHBDD2). Among them, three genes (PIK3CB, CAV2, and KANK1) 
are reportedly involved in tumorigenesis through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: We identified seven pathogenic genes in affected members of a family 
with FNMTC. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is thought to be closely related to 
the development of FNMTC, and three of the susceptibility genes identified 
herein are associated with this pathway. These findings expand our understanding 
of FNMTC pathogenesis and underscore PI3K/Akt pathology as a potential therapy 
target.
