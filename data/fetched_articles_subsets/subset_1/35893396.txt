BACKGROUND: The apparent absence of a uterus upon imaging women with primary 
amenorrhea appears to lead to a high risk of misdiagnosis, which will lead to 
significant mental distress in patients.
CASE: Three young females with primary amenorrhea were referred with a diagnosis 
of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome based on radiological findings of an 
apparently absent uterus. In two patients, the absence of the uterus could be 
confirmed, but with various diagnoses. The other patient had a normal but 
unstimulated uterus due to her hypoestrogenic state.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The presented cases illustrate the broad differential 
diagnoses and the specific pitfalls of primary amenorrhea with an apparently 
absent uterus upon imaging. A well-established diagnosis was only possible 
through a thorough correlation of imaging findings with clinical history, 
biochemical findings and physical examination.
