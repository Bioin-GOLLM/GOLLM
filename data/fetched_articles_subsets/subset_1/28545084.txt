PURPOSE: The input function (IF) is a core element in the quantification of 
Translocator protein 18 kDa with positron emission tomography (PET), as no 
suitable reference region with negligible binding has been identified. Arterial 
blood sampling is indeed needed to create the IF (ASIF). In the present 
manuscript we study individualization of a population based input function 
(PBIF) with a single arterial manual sample to estimate total distribution 
volume (VT) for [18F]FEPPA and to replicate previously published clinical 
studies in which the ASIF was used.
METHODS: The data of 3 previous [18F]FEPPA studies (39 of healthy controls (HC), 
16 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 18 with Alzheimer's disease (AD)) 
was reanalyzed with the new approach. PBIF was used with the Logan graphical 
analysis (GA) neglecting the vascular contribution to estimate VT. Time of 
linearization of the GA was determined with the maximum error criteria. The 
optimal calibration of the PBIF was determined based on the area under the curve 
(AUC) of the IF and the agreement range of VT between methods. The shape of the 
IF between groups was studied while taking into account genotyping of the 
polymorphism (rs6971).
RESULTS: PBIF scaled with a single value of activity due to unmetabolized 
radioligand in arterial plasma, calculated as the average of a sample taken at 
60 min and a sample taken at 90 min post-injection, yielded a good interval of 
agreement between methods and optimized the area under the curve of IF. In HC, 
gray matter VTs estimated by PBIF highly correlated with those using the 
standard method (r2 = 0.82, p = 0.0001). Bland-Altman plots revealed PBIF 
slightly underestimates (~1 mL/cm3) VT calculated by ASIF (including a vascular 
contribution). It was verified that the AUC of the ASIF were independent of 
genotype and disease (HC, PD, and AD). Previous clinical results were replicated 
using PBIF but with lower statistical power.
CONCLUSION: A single arterial blood sample taken 75 minute post-injection 
contains enough information to individualize the IF in the groups of subjects 
studied; however, the higher variability produced requires an increase in sample 
size to reach the same effect size.
