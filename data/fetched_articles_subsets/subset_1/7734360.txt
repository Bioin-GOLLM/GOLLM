We report the characterization of three variant antithrombins with reduced 
heparin binding as the primary abnormality. Two of these variants, antithrombin 
Southport (Leu 99 to Val, 2759 C to G) and antithrombin Vienna (Gln 118 to Pro, 
5349 A to C) were novel, whereas the third, Pro 41 to Leu, has been previously 
described as antithrombin Basel. All three variants exhibited reduced binding 
for heparin on crossed immunoelectrophoresis and in a quantitative monoclonal 
antibody-based assay. The mutations were characterized by direct sequence 
analysis of enzymatically amplified genomic DNA and all affected individuals 
were heterozygous for the mutations. These three mutations do not occur at the 
sites of the basic amino acids directly involved in heparin binding nor do they 
result in a change in charge of the affected residue. It seems probable that 
they reduce heparin affinity either by perturbing the initial contact site 
involved in the heparin-binding domain (Arg 47, Arg 129 and possibly Arg 24), or 
by preventing the subsequent heparin-induced conformational change.
