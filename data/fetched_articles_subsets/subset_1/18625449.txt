Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is an 
increasing public health problem. Because of the severity and increasing 
prevalence of the disease in the population, it is urgent that better treatments 
be developed. Active research efforts over the past several decades have 
produced a vast knowledge base regarding AD natural history, pathology, and key 
biological mediators involved in pathogenesis. As knowledge of the biomolecular 
mechanisms of AD has increased over the past several decades, there has been a 
growing consensus on the pathophysiology of the disease. These scientific 
advancements have led to proposals for disease-modifying therapeutic 
interventions that promise to significantly alter the course of AD. The 
translation from preclinical models to human studies requires therapeutic 
biomarkers to increase the likelihood of success. This review covers the current 
methods and technologies used in the therapeutic translation of proposed 
disease-modifying therapies for AD.
