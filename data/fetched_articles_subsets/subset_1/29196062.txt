BACKGROUND: Non-suicidal self-injury is being increasingly recognised as a 
prominent public health concern. Identification of early and modifiable risk 
factors is necessary to advance the screening and intervention efforts, 
particularly early detection of at-risk individuals. We aimed to examine 
childhood maltreatment, including its specific subtypes, in relation to 
non-suicidal self-injury.
METHODS: We did a comprehensive meta-analysis of childhood maltreatment 
(overall, sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect, and emotional abuse and 
neglect) in association with non-suicidal self-injury. We also provided a 
qualitative review of mediators and moderators of this association. We 
identified relevant articles published from inception to Sept 25, 2017, through 
a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. We extracted continuous 
and categorical data and assessed for potential moderators using ten study 
characteristics. We generated random-effects models for analysis and evaluated 
for publication bias.
FINDINGS: We identified 71 publications that met eligibility criteria. Overall 
childhood maltreatment was associated with non-suicidal self-injury (odds ratio 
3·42, 95% CI 2·74-4·26), and effect sizes for maltreatment subtypes ranged from 
1·84 (1·45-2·34) for childhood emotional neglect to 3·03 (2·56-3·54) for 
childhood emotional abuse. Publication bias was not evident, except in the case 
of childhood emotional neglect. Across multiple maltreatment subtypes, we found 
stronger associations with non-suicidal self-injury in non-clinical samples.
INTERPRETATION: With the exception of childhood emotional neglect, childhood 
maltreatment and its subtypes are associated with non-suicidal self-injury. 
Screening of childhood maltreatment history in non-suicidal self-injury risk 
assessments might hold particular value in community settings, and increased 
attention to childhood emotional abuse is warranted.
