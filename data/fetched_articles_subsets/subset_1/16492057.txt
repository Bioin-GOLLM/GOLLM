In the present study we have used molecular dynamics simulations to study the 
stability of the antiparallel beta-sheet in cellular mouse prion protein 
(PrP(C)) and in the D178N mutant. In particular, using the recently developed 
non-Markovian metadynamics method, we have evaluated the free energy as a 
function of a reaction coordinate related to the beta-sheet disruption/growth. 
We found that the antiparallel beta-sheet is significantly weaker in the 
pathogenic D178N mutant than in the wild-type PrP(C). The destabilization of 
PrP(C) beta-structure in the D178N mutant is correlated to the weakening of the 
hydrogen bonding network involving the mutated residue, Arg164 and Tyr128 side 
chains. This in turn indicates that such a network apparently provides a safety 
mechanism for the unzipping of the antiparallel beta-sheet in the PrP(C). We 
conclude that the antiparallel beta-sheet is likely to undergo disruption rather 
than growth under pathogenic conditions, in agreement with recent models of the 
misfolded monomer that assume a parallel beta-helix.
