In this work, a set of structurally diverse synthetic carbazoles was screened 
for their anticancer activities. According to structure-activity relationship 
studies, carbazoles with an N-substituted sulfonyl group exhibited better 
anticancer activity. Moreover, compound 8h was discovered to show the most 
potent anticancer effects on Capan-2 cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle 
arrest in G2/M phase. Finally, the in vivo study demonstrated that 8h prevented 
the tumor growth in PANC-1 and Capan-2 xenograft models without apparent 
toxicity.
