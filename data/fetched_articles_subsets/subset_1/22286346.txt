BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recessive mutations in the LHX3 homeodomain transcription 
factor gene are associated with developmental disorders affecting the pituitary 
and nervous system. We describe pediatric patients with combined pituitary 
hormone deficiency (CPHD) who harbor a novel mutation in LHX3.
METHODS: Two female siblings from related parents were examined. Both patients 
had neonatal complications. The index patient had CPHD featuring deficiencies of 
GH, LH, FSH, PRL, and TSH, with later onset of ACTH deficiency. She also had a 
hypoplastic anterior pituitary, respiratory distress, hearing impairment, and 
limited neck rotation. The LHX3 gene was sequenced and the biochemical 
properties of the predicted altered proteins were characterized.
RESULTS: A novel homozygous mutation predicted to change amino acid 194 from 
threonine to arginine (T194R) was detected in both patients. This amino acid is 
conserved in the DNA-binding homeodomain. Computer modeling predicted that the 
T194R change would alter the homeodomain structure. The T194R protein did not 
bind tested LHX3 DNA recognition sites and did not activate the α-glycoprotein 
and PRL target genes.
CONCLUSION: The T194R mutation affects a critical residue in the LHX3 protein. 
This study extends our understanding of the phenotypic features, molecular 
mechanism, and developmental course associated with mutations in the LHX3 gene.
