The emergence of antibiotic resistance and viruses with high epidemic potential 
made unexplored marine environments an appealing target source for new 
metabolites. Marine fungi represent one of the most suitable sources for the 
discovery of new compounds. Thus, the aim of this work was (i) to isolate and 
identify fungi associated with the Atlantic sponge Grantia compressa; (ii) to 
study the fungal metabolites by applying the OSMAC approach (one strain; many 
compounds); (iii) to test fungal compounds for their antimicrobial activities. 
Twenty-one fungal strains (17 taxa) were isolated from G. compressa. The OSMAC 
approach revealed an astonishing metabolic diversity in the marine fungus 
Eurotium chevalieri MUT 2316, from which 10 compounds were extracted, isolated, 
and characterized. All metabolites were tested against viruses and bacteria 
(reference and multidrug-resistant strains). Dihydroauroglaucin completely 
inhibited the replication of influenza A virus; as for herpes simplex virus 1, 
total inhibition of replication was observed for both physcion and neoechinulin 
D. Six out of 10 compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria with 
isodihydroauroglaucin being the most promising compound (minimal inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) 4-64 µg/mL) with bactericidal activity. Overall, G. 
compressa proved to be an outstanding source of fungal diversity. Marine fungi 
were capable of producing different metabolites; in particular, the compounds 
isolated from E. chevalieri showed promising bioactivity against well-known and 
emerging pathogens.
