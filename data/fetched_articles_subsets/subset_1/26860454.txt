Neddylation is a reversible post-translational modification in which a small 
ubiquitin-like molecule called NEDD8 covalently binds to substrate proteins. 
Although a recent study suggests that neddylation is essential for formation and 
maintenance of dendritic spines in the brain, the role of this protein 
modification in the peripheral nerves is wholly unknown. In this study, we 
demonstrate that neddylation-related molecules, NEDD8 and DCUN1D2 (defective in 
cullin neddylation 1, domain containing 2), were concentrated at the paranode of 
peripheral myelin, in addition to the myelinated and unmyelinated Schwann cell 
bodies. These proteins were localized mainly within larger fibers, but not in 
fibers with small diameters. Developmental analyses showed that these molecules 
first appeared at the paranode during later stages of myelination, and this 
characteristic distribution disappeared in sulfatide-deficient mice in which 
paranodal axo-glial junctions were disrupted. These results suggest that the 
myelin paranode may be one of the regions where neddylation occurs within the 
peripheral nerves.
