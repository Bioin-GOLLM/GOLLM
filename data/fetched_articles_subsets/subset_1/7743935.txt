Regulation of cell expansion is essential to the formation of plant organs. We 
have characterized 21 mutations, representing six loci, that cause abnormal cell 
expansion in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana. The phenotype of these mutants is 
conditional upon the rate of root growth. Calculation of cell volumes indicated 
that the mutations resulted in defects in either the orientation or the extent 
of expansion or in both. Analysis of cortical microtubules in the mutants 
suggested that a shift in the orientation of cell expansion may not be dependent 
on a change in the orientation of the microtubules. Double mutant combinations 
resulted in loss of the conditional phenotype suggesting that the genes may act 
in a similar pathway or encode partially redundant functions.
