The title compound (common name: sclaral), C16H28O2, is a sclareolide 
derivative, which was synthesized from sclareolide itself. In the mol-ecule, the 
two six-membered rings, A and B, of the labdane skeleton adopt chair 
conformations and the five-membered O-containing heterocyclic ring C displays an 
envelope conformation, with the methine C atom of the fused C-C bond as the 
flap. In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by O-Hâ‹¯O hydrogen bonds, forming 
chains propagating along [100].
