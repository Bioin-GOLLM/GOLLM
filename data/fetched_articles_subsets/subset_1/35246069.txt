BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common and serious 
complications of diabetes, which can lead to renal failure and fatality. miRNAs 
are an important class of endogenous non-coding RNAs implicated in a wide range 
of biological processes and pathological conditions. This study aims to 
investigate the potential functional roles of miR-543 in DN and its underlying 
mechanisms.
METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of miR-543 and 
TSPAN8 in kidney tissues of mice with DN. Western blot (WB) was used to measure 
the protein levels. CCK8 assay was employed to evaluate the proliferation of HK2 
cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to verify the functional 
interaction between miR-543 and TSpan8.
RESULTS: The downregulation of miR-543 and upregulation of TSPAN8 were observed 
in kidney tissues of mice with DN. miR-543 mimic significantly decreased cell 
proliferation and autophagy in high-glucose (HG)-induced HK2 cells, and promoted 
cell fibrosis. We further identified a putative binding site between miR-543 and 
TSPAN8, which was validated by Dual luciferase reporter assay. The treatment of 
miR-543 mimic and miR-543 inhibitor could reduce or increase TSPAN8 protein 
level respectively. We further showed that the overexpression of TSPAN8 could 
attenuate HG-induced cell injury by reducing fibrosis and increase autophagy. 
The effects of miR-543 mimic in proliferation, fibrosis, and autophagy were 
rescued by TSPAN8 overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicate that miR-543 mediates high-glucose induced DN 
via targeting TSPAN8. Interfering miR-543/TSPAN8 axis could serve as potential 
approach to ameliorate DN.
