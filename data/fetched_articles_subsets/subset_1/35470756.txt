A new class of EGFR PROTACs based on pomalidomide was developed, synthesised, 
and tested for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of human cancer cells. 
Compounds 15-21 were showed to be more effective against the four tested cell 
lines than erlotinib. In particular, compound 16 was found to be the most potent 
counterpart as it was 5.55, 4.34, 5.04, and 7.18 times more active than 
erlotinib against MCF-7, HepG-2, HCT-116, and A549 cells, respectively. Compound 
15 was revealed to be more active than doxorubicin against the four tested cell 
lines. Furthermore, the most potent cytotoxic compounds were studied further for 
their kinase inhibitory effects against EGFRWT and EGFRT790M using HTRF test. 
Compound 16 showed to be the most effective against both kinds of EGFR, with 
IC50 values of 0.10 and 4.02 µM, respectively. Compound 16 could effectively 
degrade EGFR protein through ubiquitination (Dmax = 96%) at 72 h in the tested 
cells.
