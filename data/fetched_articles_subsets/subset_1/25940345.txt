Hsp70 proteins represent a family of chaperones that regulate cellular 
homeostasis and are required for cancer cell survival. However, their function 
and regulation in mitosis remain unknown. In this paper, we show that the major 
inducible cytoplasmic Hsp70 isoform, Hsp72, is required for assembly of a robust 
bipolar spindle capable of efficient chromosome congression. Mechanistically, 
Hsp72 associates with the K-fiber-stabilizing proteins, ch-TOG and TACC3, and 
promotes their interaction with each other and recruitment to spindle 
microtubules (MTs). Targeting of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle is dependent on 
phosphorylation at Thr-66 within its nucleotide-binding domain by the Nek6 
kinase. Phosphorylated Hsp72 concentrates on spindle poles and sites of 
MT-kinetochore attachment. A phosphomimetic Hsp72 mutant rescued defects in 
K-fiber assembly, ch-TOG/TACC3 recruitment and mitotic progression that also 
resulted from Nek6 depletion. We therefore propose that Nek6 facilitates 
association of Hsp72 with the mitotic spindle, where it promotes stable K-fiber 
assembly through recruitment of the ch-TOG-TACC3 complex.
