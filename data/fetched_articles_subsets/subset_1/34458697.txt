The Laplace pressure is one of the most fundamental regulators that determine 
cell shape and function, and thus has been receiving widespread attention. Here, 
we systemically investigate the effect of the Laplace pressure on the shape and 
function of the cells during cytokinesis. We find that the Laplace pressure 
during cytokinesis can directly control the distribution and size of cell 
blebbing and adjust the symmetry of cell division by virtue of changing the 
characteristics of cell blebbing. Further, we demonstrate that the Laplace 
pressure changes the structural uniformity of cell boundary to regulate the 
symmetry of cell division. Our findings provide further insights as to the 
important role of the Laplace pressure in regulating the symmetry of cell 
division during cytokinesis.
