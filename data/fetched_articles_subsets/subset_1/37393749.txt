Titin-related myopathy is an emerging genetic neuromuscular disorder with a wide 
spectrum of clinical phenotypes. To date, there have not been reports of 
patients with this disease that presented with extraocular muscle involvement. 
Here we discuss a 19-year-old male with congenital weakness, complete 
ophthalmoplegia, thoracolumbar scoliosis, and obstructive sleep apnea. Muscle 
magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe involvement of the gluteal and 
anterior compartment muscles, and clear adductor sparing, while muscle biopsy of 
the right vastus lateralis showed distinctive cap-like structures. Trio Whole 
Exome Sequencing (WES) showed compound heterozygous likely pathologic variants 
in the TTN gene. (c.82541_82544dup (p.Arg27515Serfs*2) in exon 327 
(NM_001267550.2) and c.31846+1G>A (p.?) in exon 123 (NM_001267550.2). To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of a TTN-related disorder associated with 
ophthalmoplegia.
