The progranulin gene (GRN) g.10325_10331delCTGCTGT (relative to nt1 in 
NG_007886.1), alias Cys157LysfsX97, has been so far reported only once in a 
patient with frontotemporal dementia. Here, we describe a 63-year old patient 
carrying the same mutation, presenting with a 3-year history of language 
disorder, and diagnosed clinically with nonfluent variant of primary progressive 
aphasia according to current criteria. This patient's description expands the 
spectrum of clinical presentations of frontotemporal lobar degeneration caused 
by the GRN Cys157LysfsX97 mutation.
