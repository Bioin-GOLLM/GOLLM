BACKGROUND: Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) is a clinically and genetically 
heterogeneous group of inherited muscle disorders. Mutations in the CRPPA gene 
(encoding CDPLribitol pyrophosphorylase A) are recognized as causative factors 
of dystroglycanopathies, a subtype of CMD with defects in glycosylation.
CASE SUMMARY: The present study examined a Chinese family, whose proband 
presented mainly with muscle weakness in both lower limbs but without brain and 
eye symptoms. In this family, a homozygous deletion, c. 1114-1116del 
(p.V372del), was identified in exon 8 of CRPPA in the proband, while a 
heterozygous deletion was identified in the proband's father and mother, who 
lacked symptoms. A mild dystroglycanopathy of CMD was diagnosed.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study expanded the clinical and mutational 
spectrum of patients with CMD associated with CRPPA mutations.
