Predicting where transcription factors bind in the genome from their in vitro 
DNA-binding affinity is confounded by the large number of possible interactions 
with nearby transcription factors. To characterize the in vivo binding logic for 
the Wnt effector Tcf7l2, we developed a high-throughput screening platform in 
which thousands of synthesized DNA phrases are inserted into a specific genomic 
locus, followed by measurement of Tcf7l2 binding by DamID. Using this platform 
at two genomic loci in mouse embryonic stem cells, we show that while the 
binding of Tcf7l2 closely follows the in vitro motif-binding strength and is 
influenced by local chromatin accessibility, it is also strongly affected by the 
surrounding 99 bp of sequence. Through controlled sequence perturbation, we show 
that Oct4 and Klf4 motifs promote Tcf7l2 binding, particularly in the adjacent 
∼50 bp and oscillating with a 10.8-bp phasing relative to these cofactor motifs, 
which matches the turn of a DNA helix.
