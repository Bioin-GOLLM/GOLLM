BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and its related comorbidities are 
considered an important health issue. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of 
glycemic control on lipid profile variables in children with T1DM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 274 children (≤19 years of age) with 
T1DM who had referred to the outpatient clinics of endocrinology in Emam-Hossein 
Hospital of Isfahan, Iran. Based on American Diabetes Association criteria, 
patients were divided into two groups including optimal glycemic control (OGC) 
and poor glycemic control (PGC). Mean lipid level and frequencies of lipid 
profile abnormalities between the two studied groups were compared.
RESULTS: Mean age of the studied population was 13 ± 5.9 years and 133 (48.5%) 
were boys. A total of 162 (59.1%) and 112 (40.9%) patients had PGC and OGC, 
respectively. Hypercholesterolemia was the most common dyslipidemia in both 
groups (33 [29.1%] of OGC and 63 [39.1%] of PGC patients). The frequency of high 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was significantly higher in patients with PGC than 
those with OCG (P = 0.007). The frequencies of hypercholesterolemia, 
hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein were also 
higher in PGC group, but did not reach the significant threshold.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that glycemic control is in association with lipid 
profile abnormality in patients with T1DM. High LDL was significantly more 
frequent in patients with PGC than those with OGC. It is recommended to 
investigate the role of glycemic control on other cardiometabolic risk factors 
of T1DM patients. Our findings could be used for planning preventative 
strategies for reducing T1DM-related cardiovascular disease.
