With the aging of the population, we are seeing a global increase in the 
prevalence of age-related disorders, especially in developed countries. Chronic 
diseases disproportionately affect the older segment of the population, 
contributing to disability, a diminished quality of life and an increase in 
healthcare costs. Increased life expectancy reflects the success of contemporary 
medicine, which must now respond to the challenges created by this achievement, 
including the growing burden of chronic illnesses, injuries and disabilities. A 
well-developed theoretical framework is required to understand the molecular 
basis of aging. Such a framework is a prerequisite for the development of 
clinical interventions that will constitute an efficient response to the 
challenge of age-related health issues. This review critically analyzes the 
experimental evidence that supports and refutes the Free Radical/Mitochondrial 
Theory of Aging, which has dominated the field of aging research for almost half 
a century.
