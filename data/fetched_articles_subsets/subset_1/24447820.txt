Mouse Double Minute-2 (MDM2) is an ubiquitin ligase which is overexpressed or 
its promoter polymorphism has been reported in different tumours. The objective 
of this study was to examine the MDM2 protein expression and its promoter 
polymorphism in some canine tumours. Twenty specimens were collected from 20 
dogs with 15 mammary gland carcinomas, 3 lymphomas, 1 transmissible venereal 
tumour and 1 trichoblastoma. Samples were analysed immunohistochemically using 
human antibody against MDM2 protein. PCR and DNA sequencing were carried out to 
identify MDM2 promoter polymorphism. MDM2 gene was expressed in 13 of 20 samples 
including 11 mammary carcinomas, 1 lymphoma and 1 trichoblastoma. We found 94% 
homology between canine and human sequences. Four mutations including G169C, 
A177G, G291T and A177G were identified in different types of breast carcinomas. 
An extra p53 response element was found in a mixed mammary carcinoma.
