A Chinese patient with sporadic, severe hemophilia B was found to have a low 
level of total factor IX antigen (3.5 U/dl), but less apparent antigen in an 
assay using a calcium-dependent antibody fraction (1.1 U/dl). This suggested a 
defect in the factor IX Gla domain coded mainly by exon 2 of the factor IX gene. 
Exon 2 was therefore amplified and sequenced. An A to T substitution was found 
at nucleotide 6455 of the patient's factor IX gene. This transversion changes 
the codon for Glu 27 in normal factor IX to a codon for Val. Since Glu 27 
becomes an essential Gla residue, the defect should result in altered 
calcium-binding or calcium-dependent conformation of the patient's factor IX. 
The introduction of a hydrophobic side chain also appears to affect the 
hemophilic protein's stability. In leukocyte DNA from the patient's mother, the 
nucleotide sequence of exon 2 was entirely normal. Thus, barring somatic 
mosaicism within her germ cells, the new mutation occurred in oogenesis of her 
ovary.
