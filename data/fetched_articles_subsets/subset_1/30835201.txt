G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a family of proteins containing seven 
transmembrane helices, with the N- and C-terminus of the protein located at the 
extracellular space and cytosol, respectively. Here, we report that ceramide or 
related sphingolipids might invert the topology of many GPCRs that contain a 
GXXXN motif in their first transmembrane helix. The functional significance of 
this topological regulation is illustrated by the CCR5 chemokine receptor. In 
the absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CCR5 adopts a topology consistent with 
that of GPCR, allowing mouse peritoneal macrophages to migrate toward its ligand 
CCL5. LPS stimulation results in increased production of dihydroceramide, which 
inverts the topology of CCR5, preventing macrophages from migrating toward CCL5. 
These results suggest that GPCRs may not always adopt the same topology and can 
be regulated through topological inversion.
