Deficient Wnt signaling contributes to synapse dysfunction and loss in AD. Consistently, a variant of the LRP6 receptor, (LRP6-Val), with reduced Wnt signaling, is linked to late-onset AD. However, the impact of LRP6-Val on the healthy and AD brain has not been examined. Knock-in mice, generated by gene editing, carrying this Lrp6 variant develop normally. However, neurons from Lrp6-val mice do not respond to Wnt7a, a ligand that promotes synaptic assembly through the Frizzled-5 receptor. Wnt7a stimulates the formation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6)âFrizzled-5 complex but not if LRP6-Val is present. Lrp6-val mice exhibit structural and functional synaptic defects that become pronounced with age. Lrp6-val mice present exacerbated synapse loss around plaques when crossed to the NL-G-F AD model.

Synaptic changes occur early in the disease, before amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaque formation and neuronal loss. At the later stages of the disease, further synapse loss is observed around AÎ² plaques. It is well documented that the accumulation of oligomeric forms of AÎ² triggers synapse dysfunction and degeneration. Numerous studies demonstrate that AÎ² oligomers interfere with signaling pathways, which are critical for maintaining synapse integrity, resulting in synapse weakening and loss. However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to synapse dysfunction and loss in AD remain poorly understood.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2049</offset><text>The canonical Wnt signaling pathway, required for synapse function and stability, is impaired in AD (Fig.Â 1A). Wnt ligands and their receptors are expressed in many brain areas affected in AD (https://mouse.brain-map.org/). For instance, many Wnt ligands and Frizzled (Fz) receptors including Wnt7a, Wnt7b, and Fz5, and the Wnt co-receptor LRP6 are expressed in the postnatal and adult hippocampus. However, it is unclear whether these ligands and receptors act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion in neurons. Wnt ligands, their receptors, and co-receptors play a critical role in synaptogenesis during postnatal development and in synapse integrity in the adult brain. The first piece of evidence that Wnt signaling is compromised in AD came from the finding that Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), a secreted Wnt antagonist, is elevated in the brains of AD patients and AD mouse models. Notably, Dkk1 is required for AÎ²-induced synapse degeneration as blockade of Dkk1 protects against AÎ²-mediated synapse loss. Consistently, in vivo expression of Dkk1 in the adult brain induces synapse loss, long-term potentiation (LTP) defects, and memory impairment, as observed in AD mouse models. Second, conditional knockout (cKO) of Lrp6 in an AD mouse model increases amyloid pathology and exacerbates cognitive deficits. Last, a genetic link between deficient Wnt signaling and AD came from the identification of three genetic variants of LRP6 associated with late-onset AD (LOAD). Notably, a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs2302685) (Fig.Â 1B), which has an allele frequency of 0.17 in the European population, results in a conservative substitution of isoleucine to valine at amino acid 1062 (LRP6Ile-1062-Val; LRP6-Val herein). This substitution is located in the fourth Î²-propeller of the extracellular domain of LRP6 to which some Wnt ligands bind (Fig.Â 1B). The LRP6-Val variant reduces Wnt signaling in cell lines in response to a Wnt ligand. However, the impact of this variant on brain development, neuronal connectivity, and amyloid pathology remains unexplored.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">sciadv.abo7421-f1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>4133</offset><text>Expression of LRP6-Val induces synaptic defects in cultured neurons.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">sciadv.abo7421-f1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>4202</offset><text>(A) Diagram of canonical Wnt signaling.

Homozygous Lrp6-val mice developed normally but showed structural and functional synaptic defects in the hippocampus that became more pronounced with age. In these mice, we observed decreased levels of canonical Wnt signaling with age. Notably, neurons from Lrp6-val mice were unable to respond to Wnt7a or Wnt3a to promote synapse formation. As Wnt ligands promote the interaction between LRP6 and Fz, we examined whether the LRP6-Val variant affects this interaction by focusing on Fz5, a Wnt7a receptor required for presynaptic assembly in hippocampal neurons. We found that Wnt7a increased the association between wild-type (WT) LRP6 and Fz5, whereas this interaction was significantly impaired in the presence of LRP6-Val. Consistently, expression of LRP6-Val reduced Wnt signaling. Next, we examined the contribution of the Lrp6-val variant to AD pathogenesis by crossing these mice to hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F (NL-G-F), a KI AD mouse model. The Lrp6-val variant significantly increased synapse degeneration in NL-G-F mice. The valine substitution in the extracellular domain of LRP6 impairs its Wnt7a-mediated interaction with Fz5, affecting downstream signaling. These findings represent a significant advancement in the Wnt and AD fields by linking a genetic variant that affects Wnt signaling with the pathogenesis of the disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7629</offset><text>RESULTS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7637</offset><text>LRP6-Val fails to stimulate synaptic assembly and induces spine loss</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7706</offset><text>LRP6 is required for synapse formation and maintenance.

The addition of sFRP1 blocked the increase in the puncta number of Bassoon, a presynaptic marker, along axons induced by expression of WT LRP6 (fig. S1).

No differences in puncta number or volume of Homer1, a postsynaptic marker, were found between control and WT LRP6-expressing neurons (Fig.Â 1, E and G).

We therefore interrogated whether neurons from Lrp6-val mice responded to exogenous Wnts (Fig.Â 6A). Previous studies demonstrate that Wnt7a promotes the formation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons. Consistently, Wnt7a significantly increased the number of synapses in neurons from WT mice compared to neurons exposed to a control vehicle (Fig.Â 6, B and C). However, Wnt7a was unable to increase synapse number in hippocampal neurons from Lrp6-val mice (Fig.Â 6B and C). Crucially, the same effect was observed with a second concentration of Wnt7a (fig. S7, A and B). We also examined whether neurons from Lrp6-val mice respond to Wnt3a, another ligand involved in presynaptic assembly. Moreover, the Ile to Val amino acid substitution in LRP6 is in the Wnt3a binding site, and expression of LRP6-Val in a cell line reduces Wnt3a-mediated signaling. We found that Wnt3a increased the number of synapses in WT neurons but failed to increase synapse number in Lrp6-val neurons (fig. S7, A and C). Thus, Lrp6-val neurons respond to neither Wnt7a nor Wnt3a. The lack of response to Wnt ligands was not due to decreased levels of the LRP6-Val receptor at the plasma membrane, as the surface levels of LRP6 were the same between WT and Lrp6-val neurons (fig.

Thus, Lrp6-val impairs the ability of neurons to respond to exogenous Wnt ligands without affecting its surface localization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">sciadv.abo7421-f6.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F6</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>24480</offset><text>Neurons from Lrp6-val mice fail to respond to Wnt7a and the presence of LRP6-Val affects the formation of the Wnt receptor complex and downstream signaling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">sciadv.abo7421-f6.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F6</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>24637</offset><text>(A) Diagram depicting hippocampal neuron isolation from WT and Lrp6-val mice.

We coexpressed Fz5-HA with WT LRP6 or LRP6-Val in HeLa cells to evaluate their interaction, which is induced by Wnt7a, using proximity ligation assay (PLA), a technique that allows the detection of protein-protein interactions at less than 40 nm in cells (Fig.Â 6D).

Lrp6-val mice also exhibit progressive structural synaptic defects in the hippocampus. The presence of Lrp6-val exacerbates synapse loss around plaques in the NL-G-F AD model.

The synaptic deficits of Lrp6-val mice are not due to defects in the levels or localization of the LRP6-Val protein, as similar protein levels are found at synapses and the cell surface when compared to wildtype LRP6. This finding suggests possible defects in downstream signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, Wnt7a and Wnt3a fail to induce excitatory synapse formation in neurons isolated from Lrp6-val mice. This lack of response correlates with defects in the interaction between Fz5 and LRP6-Val in response to Wnt7a and reduced downstream Wnt signaling as determined by the levels of pLRP6 and the levels of Axin2 expression at 12 to 15 months in Lrp6-val mice. Moreover, expression of LRP6-Val attenuates canonical Wnt signaling as evaluated by the TOPFlash assay.

The lack of an early embryonic phenotype in the Lrp6-val mice could be due to the differential expression of different auxiliary proteins for the LRP6 co-receptor at different ages.
