To reinforce the anti-infective arsenal, many novel therapeutic strategies to fight bacterial infections are being explored. Among them, anti-virulence therapies, which target pathways important for virulence, have attracted much attention. Nitric oxide (NO) defense systems have been identified as critical for the pathogenesis of various bacteria, making them an appealing therapeutic target. In this study, we performed chemical screens to identify inhibitors of NO detoxification in Escherichia coli. We found that 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT) can potently inhibit cellular detoxification of NO, achieving a level of inhibition that resembled the effect of genetically removing Hmp, the dominant detoxification enzyme under oxygenated conditions. Further analysis revealed that in the presence of NO, 2-MBT impaired the catalysis of Hmp and synthesis of Hmp and other proteins, whereas in its absence there were minimal perturbations to growth and protein synthesis. In addition, by studying the structure-activity relationship of 2-MBT, we found that both sulfur atoms in 2-MBT were vital for its inhibition of NO detoxification. Interestingly, when 2-mercaptothiazole (2-MT), which lacked the benzene ring, was used, differing biological activities were observed, although they too were NO dependent. Specifically, 2-MT could still prohibit NO detoxification, though it did not interfere with Hmp catalysis; rather, it was a stronger inhibitor of protein synthesis and it reduced the transcript levels of hmp, which was not observed with 2-MBT. Overall, these results provide a strong foundation for further exploration of 2-MBT and 2-MT for therapeutic applications.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1849</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1862</offset><text>Antibiotic resistance remains a significant threat to modern medicine. Infections by resistant pathogens contribute to more than 2.8 million hospitalizations and result in more than 35,000 deaths every year in the US alone. If left unchecked, antibiotic resistance is projected to cause 10 million annual deaths globally and cost the global economy a total of as much as $100 trillion over the next 30 years. Furthermore, increasing occurrences of bacteria resistant to last resort antibiotics indicate the precarious state of the antibiotic arsenal. To address these issues, alternative modalities to treat bacterial infections have been proposed and explored. These strategies include bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, predatory bacteria that prey on pathogens, and agents that target virulence factors that are critical for pathogenesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2709</offset><text>Bacterial defenses responsible for neutralizing nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in phagocytes, have been identified in various pathogens to contribute to virulence. For instance, in Salmonella enterica, flavohemoglobin, which is encoded by hmp and detoxifies NO by converting it to NO3â, has been demonstrated to be critical for virulence. In a mouse model, infection with an hmp deletion mutant resulted in improved survivability of hosts compared to those infected with wild-type (WT), which indicated that the mutant was less virulent. This reduction in virulence was confirmed to depend on NO generated in the host, because when the activity of iNOS was blocked by a chemical inhibitor, the hmp mutant recovered WT-level virulence, which validated that the ability to cope with phagocytic NO is closely linked to virulence in Salmonella. As another example, the removal of norV, which encodes for NO reductase, in enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) reduced bacterial viability inside macrophages, suggesting that the ability to detoxify NO is important for EHEC to withstand immune attack. Moreover, the presence of norV was observed to increase the production of Shiga toxin 2, which has been associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by EHEC, in phagocytized EHEC adding another layer to how nitrosative defenses contribute to bacterial virulence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4120</offset><text>Given the importance of NO detoxification to microbial pathogenesis, a potentially feasible strategy to combat bacterial infections centers on disabling their NO defense networks). However, currently known inhibitors of bacterial NO defenses are not promising drug candidates. Cyanide (CN) has long been recognized as a strong inhibitor of Hmp (, but its acute toxicity to humans prevents it from being further developed as a therapeutic agent. Another known inhibitor of Hmp is carbon monoxide (CO), which also presents serious health hazards; although, designing controllable CO-releasing molecules (CORM) is an active area of research. To address this targeting challenge, identified imidazoles as catalytic inhibitors of purified Hmp. Imidazoles can bind to the heme pocket of Hmp, prohibiting the cofactor from being reduced and thereby, blocking downstream reactions. However, imidazoles have low permeability across bacterial double membranes and require the co-administration of a membrane-disrupting antibiotic to be effective in Gram-negative bacteria.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5183</offset><text>In this study, we performed a chemical screen of 8,320 small molecules to identify selective inhibitors of NO defenses in E. coli. From this screen, we identified 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT) to be growth inhibitory under aerobic conditions only in the presence of NO. Further analysis revealed that 2-MBT interfered with the catalysis and synthesis of Hmp, the dominant NO-detoxifying enzyme in oxygenated conditions. Notably, treating cells with 2-MBT prior to NO exposure reduced their ability to detoxify NO to a level that was comparable to a Îhmp mutant. Investigation of the compoundâs structure-activity relationship indicated that both sulfur atoms were crucial for 2-MBTâs inhibitory effects, whereas the benzene ring was important for the inhibition of Hmp catalysis. Specifically, 2-mercaptothiazole (2-MT), which lacks the benzene ring, can block NO detoxification, but does so by reducing hmp transcript and Hmp protein levels, rather than inhibition of Hmp catalysis. Overall, this study identified 2-MBT and 2-MT as compounds that selectively enhance the antibacterial activity of NO, elucidated that their mechanisms of action were multi-faceted, and delineated chemical moieties that were important for their activities.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6430</offset><text>Materials and Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>6452</offset><text>Strains and Plasmids</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6473</offset><text>All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. E. coli MG1655 imp4213, harboring a truncated lptD, was generously provided by Thomas Silhavy and used throughout this study. To construct WCMV1, Îhmp:camR was introduced into imp4213 through P1 transduction from a previously generated donor strain. Transductants were selected on Luria-Bertani broth (LB) agar with 10 Î¼g/mL chloramphenicol (CAM), and gene deletion checked by PCR using primers 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 (Supplementary Table S2). Due to the hypersensitivity of imp4213 to antibiotics, the concentration of CAM used for selection was determined by plating transduction products on LB agar with different concentrations of CAM from 5 to 100 Î¼g/mL and choosing the highest concentration that yielded colonies (10 Î¼g/mL). After confirming hmp deletion through colony PCR, retention of the imp4213 phenotype (absence of suppressor mutants) was verified by plating on LB with 1.5 mg/mL bile salts, which prohibits growth of imp4213 but allows growth of WT. pWC04 was obtained from a previous study and pWCMV1 was constructed in this study. These plasmids were separately introduced into imp4213 Îhmp:camR through electroporation, and selected on LB agar with 10 Î¼g/mL kanamycin (KAN). This concentration was also set to the highest KAN concentration that allowed colony formation after transformation. Again, after colony selection from KAN plates, retention of the imp4213 phenotype was confirmed by plating in the presence of bile salts.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8013</offset><text>Media and Chemicals</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8033</offset><text>LB broth was made by dissolving pre-mixed LB (BD Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States) in Milli-Q water, and LB agar contained the same compositions as that of liquid LB with the addition of 1.5 w/v% agar.

Therefore, the initial screen was designed to identify compounds that inhibit growth in the presence of NO (Figure 1). A scrape of cells from a frozen stock of imp4213 was used to inoculate 1 mL of LB media and grown for 4 h in a shaking incubator maintained at 37Â°C and 250 rpm. After that, 10 Î¼L of the growing culture was removed and added to 1 mL of fresh MOPS media and grown for 16 h. The overnight culture was then used to inoculate 20 mL of fresh MOPS media in a baffled flask to an OD600 of 0.01. Cells were grown to the exponential phase (OD600 â¼ 0.25) and harvested for screening. 384-well clear plastic plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) were used for screening. Briefly, the first and last 2 columns (columns 1, 2, 23, and 24) of the plate were used for controls, and each remaining well of the plate contained 0.15 Î¼L of a distinct small molecule dissolved in DMSO, which after addition of the remaining reagents yielded a final concentration of 50 Î¼M. One Î¼L of 3.05 mM KCN, a known inhibitor of the major NO detoxifying enzyme, Hmp, in E. coli under oxygenated conditions, was added to every well of the first column (column 1) as the positive control, and 1 Î¼L of DMSO added to the second column as the negative control (column 2). To account for edge effects, we repeated the negative control in the last column (column 24) and the positive control in the second to last column (column 23). After the additions of KCN and DMSO to the outer columns, 28.5 Î¼L of harvested exponential-phase cells were added to each well using a Multidrop CombiTM reagent dispenser (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Then, 1 Î¼L of 9.91 mM DPTA was manually added to each well using a multi-channel pipette to achieve a final concentration of 325 Î¼M in the control wells and 334 Î¼M in the wells containing small molecules. The slight difference in final DPTA concentrations was due to the different volumes of DMSO and KCN added (1 Î¼L) compared to the small molecules (0.15 Î¼L) added, which was a result of the resolution of the manual multi-channel pipette used in comparison to the small molecule dispenser. Immediately afterward, the OD600 in each well was measured using a BioTek SynergyTM H1 Hybrid spectrophotometer. The plate was then sealed with a Breathe-Easy membrane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) to minimize evaporation and placed in a shaking incubator for growth. At designated time points, the plate was taken out from the incubator and the Breathe-Easy membrane was removed for OD600 measurement, after which a new Breathe-Easy membrane was placed on the plate for subsequent growth in the incubator. The OD600 profiles were used to calculate the area under curve (AUCOD600) during growth, by integrating OD600 over time using the trapezoid rule. To assess the quality of data in each plate, AUCOD600 values for negative and positive controls were used to calculate zâ-factors (Equation 1),</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">fbioe-08-01001-g001.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>13011</offset><text>A schematic description of the screening workflow. In the initial screen (blue arrow on the left), 384-well plates were seeded with compounds (blue wells) from a chemical library in the Princeton University Small Molecule Screening Center. The columns on the edges were used to run positive (yellow wells that contained 100 Î¼M KCN) and negative (green wells that contained DMSO). After the addition of cells and DPTA, growth in each well was monitored by measuring OD600, which was used to calculate an area under the curve (AUCOD600). Compounds that inhibited growth in the presence of NO would have a low AUCOD600 (red shaded area), whereas those that allowed growth would yield a high AUCOD600 (blue shaded area). Inhibitors from the initial screen (those with a z-score &lt; â3) were then passed on to a confirmation screen (green arrow in the middle), in which growth inhibition in the presence of NO was verified, and a counter screen (red arrow on the right), in which growth in the absence of NO was measured. Compounds that failed the confirmation test (green square) or were growth inhibitory in the absence of NO (red square) were discarded. The remaining compounds were identified as NO-dependent growth inhibitors because they allowed growth in the absence of NO, but inhibited growth in the presence of NO at a concentration that could not inhibit growth on its own.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14392</offset><text>where Î¼p and Î¼n represent the average AUCOD600 from the positive control and negative control, respectively, and Ïp and Ïn the standard deviations of their corresponding means.

In total, 4,480 compounds from the biologically active library and 3,840 compounds from the other library were screened.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">fbioe-08-01001-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>15366</offset><text>z-score from the initial, confirmation and counter screens. In (A,B), the z-scores of every compound evaluated during the initial screen are plotted. Compounds were from two sub-libraries: one containing compounds with demonstrated biological activity (biologically active library) (A) and the other representing a general small molecule library (generic library) (B). A total of 8,320 compounds were tested in the initial screen, 4,480 of which came from the biologically active library and the remaining 3,840 from the generic library. Representative OD600 profiles that either passed (outlined in green) or did not pass (outlined in orange) the z-score threshold of â3 (horizontal gray line) were plotted on the top. The growth curve associated with 2-MBT treatment from the initial screen is plotted in the green box in (A). In (C,D), the z-scores of hits from the initial screen during the confirmation and counter screens are plotted. In (C), growth inhibition in the presence of NO was verified. Compounds with high z-scores allowed growth and were identified as outliers (circle in red). We note that since the confirmation screen only included hits, the z-scores between the primary screen and confirmation screen will not be the same. In (D), growth in the absence of NO was measured. NO-specific growth inhibitors would not inhibit growth during this screen, so compounds with the higher z-scores allowed relatively better growth. A natural break in the data occurs around a z-score of 0 in the counter screen, therefore compounds with z-scores &gt; 0 were identified as growth permissive. Of note, out of 20 compounds that had a positive z-score in the counter screen, 3 were outliers in the confirmation screen (C) and thus were disqualified, and 17 compounds were identified as hits from the screening procedure.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17192</offset><text>The concentration of KCN (100 Î¼M in the final volume) was chosen to achieve inhibition of NO detoxification while not completely stopping respiration.

When DPTA coexisted with KCN, cells could not grow due to inhibition of NO detoxification; whereas, when DPTA was individually treated, cells would resume growth after NO cleared. These growth data were quantified and used to calculate the zâ-factor for each concentration of DPTA, using the non-growing condition as the positive control and the growth-permissive condition as the negative control.

To eliminate the general growth inhibitors, a counter screen was carried out in the absence of NO. Cells were grown similarly to those grown for the initial screen. The seeded plate used at this step only contained hits from the initial screen. Identical to the initial screen, the first and last 2 columns of the plate were reserved for KCN and DMSO controls, which were set up identically to those used in the initial screen. After exponential-phase cells were added to the wells, instead of treating with DPTA, 1 Î¼L of 10 mM NaOH (DPTA solvent) was added to each well, and growth was quantified with OD600 measurements (counter screen). At the same time, an identical set-up was used and DPTA was delivered to provide a second reading on the ability of hits to inhibit growth in the presence of NO (confirmation screen). The resulting growth curves were then used to calculate AUCOD600, and the zâ-factor was calculated for the confirmation screen (in counter screen both DMSO and KCN grow well). For both plates, z-scores were calculated and plotted (Figures 2C,D). Since samples on these plates were solely comprised of initial hits, z-scores from the confirmation screen would not match those of the initial screen (AUCÎ¼ and AUCÏ would be different), but rather the z-scores were used to identify positive outliers (e.g., compounds labeled 43, 44, 45), which would have reflected comparably weak growth inhibition in the presence of NO or erroneous identification from the primary screen (Figure 2C). For the counter screen, z-scores were dichotomous with a clear distinction between those with negative z-scores (25 initial hits), which reflected comparably poor growth, and those with positive z-scores (20 initial hits), which reflected comparably better growth (Figure 2D). Three of the initial hits (compounds 43, 44, 45) had positive z-scores in the counter screen, but were not considered further due to their positive outlier z-scores from the confirmation screen. Therefore, from 45 compounds evaluated (initial screen hits), 17 were identified by the confirmation and counter screens as potential NO-specific growth inhibitors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>20463</offset><text>Dilution Tests</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20478</offset><text>imp4213 cells were grown to exponential phase following the procedure described for the chemical screen.

Identical to the initial screen, the first and last columns were used for positive (+KCN) and negative (+DMSO) controls, with positive controls in columns 1 and 23 and negative controls in columns 2 and 24. One Î¼L of 9.91 mM DPTA or the same volume of 10 mM NaOH was then added, and growth monitored by measuring OD600. AUCOD600s were then calculated by integrating the growth curve. To account for the non-zero AUCOD600 baseline, because AUCOD600 of a non-growing culture would be larger than 0 due to a constant, non-zero OD600, AUCOD600 of each compound under each condition was subtracted by the average AUCOD600 of the positive controls (+KCN and +DPTA), which was non-growing under our experimental conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>21636</offset><text>Growth Assay</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21649</offset><text>Cells were grown to exponential phase following procedures described in previous sections.

The tubes were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature, and supernatant removed. One mL of fresh MOPS media warmed to 37Â°C was used to resuspend the pellets in all 8 tubes, effectively concentrating the cells. The concentrated culture was then added to a bioreactor consisting of 10 mL fresh MOPS and 25 Î¼L DMSO or compound of interest dissolved in DMSO to achieve an OD600 of 0.05. Immediately afterward, DPTA or PAPA dissolved in 10 mM NaOH was added to achieve a concentration of 250 or 34 Î¼M, respectively, in the bioreactor. The bioreactor was a 50 mL Falcon tube (Sigma-Aldrich) that contained a spin bar (1.27 cm) at the bottom spinning at approximately 400 rpm (to ensure well-mixedness), which was placed in a 37Â°C water bath. Throughout the assay, a NO probe, ISO-NOP 2 mM electrode (World Precision Instruments, Inc.), which uses a proprietary semi-permeable membrane highly selective for NO, was submersed â¼1 cm below surface level in the bioreactor to continuously measure NO concentrations via current readings that were recorded using LabScribe3 software (iWorkx). The probe was calibrated daily using CuCl2 and SNAP following procedures described in previous studies. In short, 10 mL of 10 mM CuCl2 was added to a 50 mL falcon tube and placed in a water bath kept at 37Â°C. In the CuCl2 solution, a spin bar was added to allow mixing by spinning at 400 rpm and a NO probe was submersed â¼1 cm below the surface to measure NO concentrations. Different concentrations of SNAP were then added sequentially. Under our conditions, we have previously determined that 0.457 equivalents of NO are generated per molecule of SNAP. Using this conversion rate, we created a plot with the concentration of NO produced on the x-axis and changes in current (ÎpA) on the y-axis, which was used to fit a line. The slope of the fitted equation was then used to convert current readings to NO concentration for experiments conducted on that day.

Growth in the presence of NO was monitored by OD600 measurements at time points over 6 h. Area under the OD600 curve (AUCOD600) from each well was then calculated to quantify the extent of growth (Figure 1). Growth data from KCN and DMSO controls were used to calculate the zâ-factor (Equation 1), which quantified the quality of data of each plate by assessing the statistical distance between the controls. Plates that had a zâ-factor below the threshold of 0.5 were discarded. For each of the remaining plates, z-scores of each compound on the plate were calculated to assess its relative ability to influence growth against the average of the plate. Hits were identified as compounds that had a z-score of â3 or lower (Figure 1). A z-score below â3 indicated that in the presence of the compound, cellular growth, quantified using AUCOD600, was at least 3 standard deviations below the average growth on the plate (Figures 2A,B).

Under this condition, molecules that specifically impaired NO detoxification would allow growth, whereas those that targeted essential cellular processes would still inhibit growth (Figure 1). In addition, an identical 384-well plate was grown in the presence of NO as a confirmation step for the initial screen hits (confirmation screen). z-scores from these plates were inspected and potential NO detoxification inhibitors were identified as those compounds with positive z-scores in the counter screen, which did not yield positive z-score outliers in the confirmation screen (Figures 2C,D).

When 2-MBT was used for treatment, the [NO] dynamics were close to those of Îhmp (Figure 3D), which suggested that cellular detoxification was greatly compromised. Notably, even when [2-MBT] was reduced by half, the strength of inhibition was unaffected, which demonstrated the potency of 2-MBT as an inhibitor of NO detoxification in E. coli. Additionally, to ensure that the effects observed were independent of the NO donor, we performed NO detoxification assays using a structurally different NO donor, PAPA. When treated with PAPA, 2-MBT still inhibited NO detoxification to an extent similar to Îhmp, whereas DMSO-treated cells cleared NO rapidly (Supplementary Figure S4).

Data from 2-MBT treatment after NO clearance show that [NO] increased, indicating that 2-MBT inhibited Hmp catalysis (Figure 7). Interestingly, when 2-MT, which inhibited NO detoxification as strongly as 2-MBT, was added after NO clearance, [NO] remained near zero (Figure 7). This suggested that 2-MT did not diminish Hmp catalysis and that the benzene ring may be important for an interaction with Hmp.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>50871</offset><text>hmp Promoter Activity</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50893</offset><text>As previously mentioned, another potential mechanism of inhibiting NO detoxification is by impeding Hmp synthesis. To evaluate the relevance of this mechanism, we used pWC04, which expresses gfpSF from the native promoter of hmp (Phmp) on pUA66, a low-copy number plasmid. We transformed this plasmid into the strain WCMV1, an imp4213 variant that lacked hmp on the chromosome, to ensure consistency of NO environments between experimental conditions used (without Hmp, [NO] dynamics are indistinguishable) and fluorescence was measured to gauge protein abundance. Since Phmp is activated by NO, the expression of gfpSF should be induced by the presence of NO. Control experiments verified that the inductive response of Phmp to NO was preserved in imp4213 Îhmp (Figure 8A). When a different construct, pUA66 on which gfp lacked a promoter, was used the fluorescence level did not increase after the introduction of NO (Figure 8B). To assess whether 2-MBT and 2-MT reduced Hmp synthesis, we monitored fluorescence accumulation following treatments with 2-MBT or 2-MT in the presence and absence of NO. As expected, when cells were not exposed to NO, there was minimal accumulation of fluorescence (Figure 8C and Supplementary Figure S6). When NO was introduced, cells treated with DMSO continuously accumulated fluorescence (Figure 8D and Supplementary Figure S6). However, in cells treated with 2-MBT and 2-MT, the induction of Phmp was reduced, which resulted in an â¼73% drop in the induced protein output from Phmp, relative to that of the DMSO control, after 1.5 h of NO treatment for both compounds. Culturability loss was ruled out as a potential contributor to the reduced protein output in WCMV1 harboring pWC04 (Supplementary Figure S7), and we also confirmed that 2-MBT and 2-MT did not impact WCMV1 growth and culturability in the absence of NO (Supplementary Figure S8). These data collectively suggest that 2-MBT and 2-MT suppress the synthesis of Hmp in response to NO.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">fbioe-08-01001-g008.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F8</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>52881</offset><text>Protein output from Phmp in the absence and presence of NO with and without inhibitors.

In the absence of NO, both 2-MBT and 2-MT did not decrease fluorescence accumulation, relative to the DMSO control (Figure 9A and Supplementary Figure S10). When NO was present, although protein synthesis was generally reduced compared to the growing control, GFPSF abundance steadily increased in the DMSO-only sample (Figure 9B and Supplementary Figure S10), whereas both 2-MBT and 2-MT drastically stifled GFPSF synthesis, achieving a terminal fluorescence level â¼18% and â¼10%, respectively, of that of the DMSO-only control.

Its physiological relevance is best illustrated by the increased vulnerability of mice to bacterial infections when iNOS, which is primarily responsible for NO synthesis in phagocytes, has been deleted. Various pathogens have evolved strategies to deal with NO, and these defenses have been identified as crucial virulence factors. For example, using a mouse model, the deletion of hmp in uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) resulted in a significant reduction in its ability to survive in the host. The clinical relevance of hmp was further supported by the induction of hmp expression in UPEC from patients with urinary tract infections. With Yersinia pestis, when hmp was removed its survivability in macrophages and virulence in rodent models were severely attenuated. The widespread importance of NO defenses for bacterial virulence makes them an appealing target for therapeutic development to fight infections. However, currently known inhibitors of these defenses have poor drug-like properties, such as human toxicity (KCN) and low permeability across bacterial outer membranes (imidazoles). These drawbacks motivated the investigation here, which seeks to identify novel inhibitors of bacterial NO defenses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>59694</offset><text>The chemical screening approach adopted in this study was inspired by previous works that used compound synergy screening. For example, through a synergistic screen, Zhang and colleagues successfully identified beauvericin as a synergistic partner of the fungicide ketoconazole (KTC), which increased the efficacy of KTC in a mouse model. In a different screen, Ramon-Garcia and coworkers discovered numerous compounds that could synergize with spectinomycin for the treatment of mycobacteria. Here, we first identified 45 compounds that inhibited growth in the presence of NO from 8,320 molecules, and then performed both a confirmation screen to confirm primary hit results and a counter screen in the absence of NO to distinguish compounds that were specifically deleterious in the presence of NO from those that were general growth inhibitors. A total of 17 potential NO-specific inhibitors were identified, and among them, 2-MBT was pursued further due to the magnitude and selectivity of its effects. Interestingly, 2-MBT had previously been reported to exhibit antifungal and antiviral activities, and the data presented here suggests that it can selectively potentiate the antibacterial effects of NO against E. coli (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure S3).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>60960</offset><text>By using chemical analogs of 2-MBT we explored its structure-activity relationship, and found that both sulfur atoms were crucial to the capacity of 2-MBT to inhibit NO detoxification. Moreover, even when both sulfur atoms were present, substitution of the mercapto group (âSH) with a thiomethyl (âSCH3) eliminated its inhibitory activity on NO detoxification (Figure 5B). The presence of the methyl group prevents disulfide bond formation. Although the thiomethyl group is also bulkier than the mercapto group, we do not think size contributes to the abolishment of inhibition because when the mercapto group was replaced by a similarly sized hydroxyl group (âOH), inhibition of NO detoxification was substantially weakened (Figure 5B). These data suggested that the ability of the mercapto group to be oxidized is important for the observed activity of 2-MBT on NO detoxification. On the contrary, the benzene ring seemed dispensable because 2-MT prohibited NO detoxification as strongly as 2-MBT. In addition, it is worth noting that thiazoles and imidazoles are chemically similar (a sulfur in place of a nitrogen); although, experiments performed with BT and 2-MBX suggest that imidazoles similar to 2-MBT would not block NO detoxification to the same extent. In support of this statement, we performed experiments with imidazole and benzimidazole under identical assay conditions and observed that 2-MT and 2-MBT were much more potent inhibitors of NO detoxification than the analogous imidazoles (Supplementary Figure S11).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>62497</offset><text>Since treatment with 2-MBT or 2-MT resulted in a phenotype that resembled Îhmp, we hypothesized that Hmp was the target of these compounds. To examine this hypothesis, we treated exponential-phase cells with both compounds after they had reduced the [NO] in the system to near zero. Under those conditions, DPTA continues to release NO, but [NO] stays low due to the action of Hmp. Addition of an inhibitor of Hmp catalysis would lead to an increase in [NO], which was observed for KCN, whereas if inhibition occurred through a different mechanism [NO] would stay low, such as in the case of chloramphenicol (Figure 7). The addition of 2-MBT caused a steady increase in [NO], suggesting that Hmp activity was declining (Figure 7). Interestingly, treatment with 2-MT did not change [NO] (Figure 7), which implied that 2-MT does not act through inhibition of Hmp catalysis. The difference in activity between 2-MT and 2-MBT in this assay suggested that the benzene ring of 2-MBT may be important for its interaction with Hmp. Interestingly, the hydrophobic residues of large imidazoles have previously been suggested to play a role in their interaction with and blocking of the heme pocket of Hmp.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>63697</offset><text>Given the differences observed for 2-MBT and 2-MT in the assay to probe inhibition of Hmp catalysis, we hypothesized that interference with Hmp synthesis, which is induced in response to NO, might contribute to the abilities of 2-MT and 2-MBT to block NO detoxification. To assess this possibility, we expressed gfpSF from the hmp promoter on a low-copy plasmid. Since Phmp is known to be activated by NO, fluorescence did not accumulate when NO was absent (Figure 8C). In the presence of NO, the treatment of 2-MBT and 2-MT greatly impaired the inductive output from Phmp (Figure 8D), reducing GFPSF accumulation by â¼3.6-fold for both compounds after 1.5 h of NO treatment, relative to the DMSO-only control. To investigate whether the inhibition of protein synthesis was limited to Hmp, we expressed gfpSF from an IPTG inducible T5 promoter and used 2 mM IPTG to fully induce expression. In the absence of NO, 2-MBT and 2-MT did not repress the synthesis of GFPSF (Figure 9A); however, when NO was present, they substantially stifled the synthesis of GFPSF, achieving an inductive fluorescence level that was approximately 5.6-fold and 9.6-fold lower for 2-MBT and 2-MT (Figure 9B), respectively, compared to that of the DMSO-only control at the terminal time point. These results suggested that 2-MBT and 2-MT not only inhibited Hmp synthesis but also arrested the production of other proteins under NO stress, whereas protein synthesis was unperturbed by these compounds in the absence of NO.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>65196</offset><text>The reduction of Hmp synthesis could result from a decrease in hmp transcript levels.

Our results indicated that 2-MBT does not interfere with hmp transcript levels, whereas 2-MT significantly reduced hmp transcript levels in the presence of NO compared to both 2-MBT and the DMSO-control (Figure 10). We note that the differences in transcript levels observed could have resulted from decreased transcription or enhanced mRNA degradation. These results collectively reflect the importance of the benzene ring to the biological activity of 2-MBT. Without the benzene ring, 2-MT no longer inhibited Hmp catalysis, but began to impair accumulation of transcripts expressed from the hmp promoter.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>65986</offset><text>Thiazoles and benzothiazoles, such as 2-MT and 2-MBT, have attracted interest as therapeutic agents for a variety of applications ranging from antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory to treatment of cancer. Clinical successes with thiazoles include dabrafenib for treating advanced melanoma and metastatic lung cancer, riluzole for delaying the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and pramipexole for treating Parkinsonâs disease. In addition, there are numerous thiazoles and benzothiazoles undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimerâs disease, depression, asthma, and melanoma. Collectively, these efforts show that the thiazole and benzothiazole scaffold is amenable to therapeutic applications. The findings reported here suggest that those scaffolds hold potential for the potentiation of NO against bacteria. However, important questions remain regarding the properties of 2-MBT and 2-MT, such as their ability to cross bacterial membranes and their proclivity to be expelled by bacterial multi-drug efflux pumps. Indeed, additional structure-activity experiments need to be performed, especially in light of the fact that both 2-MBT and 2-MT are irritants, and the mechanisms of action need to be fleshed out at the molecular level. Despite these future milestones, identification of compounds that impair bacterial propagation and defenses selectively in the presence of NO lends confidence to the potential of bacterial NO defenses as anti-infective targets.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>67485</offset><text>Data Availability Statement</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>67513</offset><text>This article contains previously unpublished data.
