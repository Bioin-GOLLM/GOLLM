In innate immune cells, response to 1,25D has been linked to metabolic reprogramming. It is unclear whether 1,25D has similar effects on CD4+ T cells, although it is known that antigen stimulation of these cells promotes an anabolic metabolic phenotype, characterized by high rates of aerobic glycolysis to support clonal expansion and effector cytokine expression. Here, we performed in-depth analysis of metabolic capacity and pathway usage, employing extracellular flux and stable isotope-based tracing approaches, in CD4+ T cells treated with 1,25D. We report that 1,25D significantly decreases rates of aerobic glycolysis in activated CD4+ T cells, whilst exerting a lesser effect on mitochondrial glucose oxidation. This is associated with transcriptional repression of Myc, but not repression of mTOR activity under these conditions. Consistent with the modest effect of 1,25D on mitochondrial activity, it also did not impact CD4+ T-cell mitochondrial mass or membrane potential. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of aerobic glycolysis by 1,25D substantially contributes to its immune-regulatory capacity in CD4+ T cells, since the suppression of IFN-gamma expression was significantly blunted in the absence of aerobic glycolysis. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by CD4+ T cells, but the underpinning mechanisms are not yet fully defined. Here, we identify that 1,25D inhibits aerobic glycolysis in activated CD4+ T cells, associated with decreased c-Myc expression. This mechanism appears to substantially contribute to the suppression of IFN-gamma by 1,25D, since this is significantly blunted in the absence of aerobic glycolysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2070</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2083</offset><text>The active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), has modulatory activity on a range of immune cells, prompting an interest in its potential therapeutic use in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Although a systemic steroid hormone, 1,25D is also synthesized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which also express the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) for 1,25D. Within an immune microenvironment, 1,25D can therefore act in an intracrine fashion to modulate APC activity by suppressing expression of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80/86, whilst increasing expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-L1. Induction of a tolerogenic APC phenotype in this way, enables 1,25D to indirectly suppress T cell function and promote regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. However, 1,25D can also bind to VDR in T cells to exert direct effects, notably, induction of Treg, upregulation of CTLA-4 and IL-10, and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The mechanisms for this direct regulation of T cells by 1,25D are not yet fully characterized.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3193</offset><text>In recent years, studies have shown that regulation of metabolic function is a key target for 1,25D in innate immune cells. In macrophages, 1,25D can alter cholesterol metabolism to reduce the formation of foam-cells. Tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDCs) differentiated in the presence of 1,25D exhibit high levels of glycolysis and elevated fatty acid synthesis, which enable these DCs to exert their tolerogenic effects on T cells. Cellular metabolism is also closely associated with T cell function. Upon antigen recognition, T cells substantially increase metabolic activity, and particularly their rates of aerobic glycolysis. This supports the clonal expansion of T cells through the rapid generation of ATP, as well as nucleotide, amino acid, and lipid precursors produced from glycolytic intermediates. Moreover, increased glycolytic metabolism has been directly linked to the expression of effector cytokines such as IFN-gamma, through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Specifically, increased glycolytic activity of the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in activated T cells decreases its binding to IFN-gamma mRNA, thereby permitting enhanced translation. Additionally, glucose-derived acetyl-CoA, generated via activity of the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is used to acetylate histones, facilitating IFNG gene transcription. Recent studies have suggested a role for 1,25D as a modulator of T cell metabolism, by identifying transcriptional regulation of key metabolic genes, whilst others have correlated high serum 25D levels with lower rates of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis in T cells. However, specific metabolic effects of 1,25D on T cells and how these relate to immunomodulatory activity have yet to be studied in detail. We therefore set out to interrogate the effects of 1,25D on human CD4+ T cell metabolism, through in-depth analysis of functional metabolic capacity and metabolic pathway usage.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5195</offset><text>MATERIALS AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5217</offset><text>Human peripheral blood donors</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5247</offset><text>Human CD4+ T cells were isolated from fully anonymized leukocyte cones collected from NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), Birmingham, UK.

Using this perturbation profiling technique, four OCR rates were directly measured: the basal OCR [OCR(Basal)], the rate after inhibition of ATP-synthase with Oligomycin [OCR(Oligomycin)], the peak rate after mitochondrial uncoupling with BAM 15 [OCR(BAM 15)], and the rate after inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with Rotenone/Antimycin A [OCR(Rotenone/Antimycin A)]. The following respiratory parameters were then calculated from using the following formulae: (i) Basal OCR = [OCR (Basal)] - [OCR(Rotenone/Antimycin A)]; (ii) ATP-coupled respiration (OCR) = [OCR(Basal)] - [OCR(Oligomycin)]; (iii) maximal respiratory capacity = [OCR(BAM 15)] - [OCR(Rotenone/Antimycin A)]; and (iv) spare respiratory capacity (SRC) = [OCR(BAM 15)] - [OCR(Basal)].

Both 1 and 10 nM 1,25D decreased the basal and ATP-coupled OCR of these cells but had less effect on maximal and spare respiratory capacity, stimulated by injection of the mitochondrial uncoupling reagent, Bam-15 (Figure 1b).

CD4+ T cells that had been activated in presence or absence of 1,25D were incubated with fully-labelled 13C-glucose before analysis of metabolite abundances and 13C-labelling by GC-MS. These experiments identified no significant difference in the fractional 13C-labelling of pyruvate, or of overall pyruvate abundance with either dose of 1,25D (Figure 1d). However, both total and labelled lactate were significantly decreased upon treatment with 1,25D. In all TCA cycle intermediates there was a trend towards a reduction in both total and labelled ion counts with 1,25D treatment, but this was only significant for fumarate and glutamate, which is synthesized from alpha-ketoglutarate (Figure 1d). These data indicate that 1,25D significantly suppresses aerobic glycolysis and lactate production in T cells, and, to a lesser extent, mitochondrial glucose oxidation. In agreement with this finding, no significant difference in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in 1,25D-treated T cells, as measured using the membrane-potential sensitive fluorescent probe MitoSpy Orange (Figure 1e). Likewise, use of MitoView Green to measure mitochondrial mass by flow cytometry also showed no difference with 1,25D treatment (Figure 1f). To confirm this by another approach, mitochondria were visualized by confocal microscopy, which also confirmed no change in overall cellular mitochondrial content (Figure 1g,h). Glucose tracing data also indicated little incorporation of glucose into serine in the control or 1,25D-treated T cells under these conditions (Figure S2A), as well as no change in the transcription of rate-limiting enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, suggesting no divergence to one-carbon metabolism in CD4+ T cells treated with 1,25D (Figure S2B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>18729</offset><text>1,25D suppresses c-Myc expression in activated T cells, but not mitochondrial biogenesis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18818</offset><text>C-Myc is an important transcription factor driving glycolysis and glutaminolysis in T cells and expression of c-Myc has been reported to be suppressed by 1,25D in T cells. After 48 hr, CD4+ T cells treated with 1 or 10 nM 1,25D demonstrated lower levels of Myc mRNA than control cells (Figure 2a). In agreement with this, c-Myc protein levels, as assessed by flow cytometry were also decreased by 50% on average in 1,25D-treated T cells (Figure 2b). One possible explanation for this is that c-Myc expression is decreased secondary to 1,25D-mediated inhibition of IL-2 secretion, since IL-2 is reported to drive c-Myc expression. However, we observed that 1,25D suppressed c-Myc protein expression across a broad range of IL-2 concentration in culture, and to an equal extent in presence of an IL-2 neutralizing antibody as an isotype control (Figure S3A,B). Taken together, these data indicate that 1,25D may directly inhibit c-Myc expression independently of its effects on IL-2. C-Myc is known to induce transcription of the glucose transporter Glut1. Here, analysis of Glut1 mRNA levels did not identify a consistent downregulation upon 1,25D treatment, although a downward trend was observed (Figure 2c). Analysis of a panel of key mitochondrial biogenesis genes (Ppara, Prc, Nrf1, or Tfam) showed no effect of 1,25D on mRNA expression (Figure 2d-g), consistent with the lack of effect of 1,25D on mitochondrial mass and function at this time point. Transcription of Myc in CD4+ T cells is induced by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. We therefore sought to assess whether 1,25D impacted mTOR activity. Western blot analysis of phosphorylated p70S6K, a protein kinase directly phosphorylated by mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), showed no difference with 1,25D treatment (Figure 2h). This was confirmed by flow cytometry, where significant loss of phospho-p70S6K was only observed for cells treated with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Figure 2i,j). These data indicate that the suppressive effect of 1,25D on glycolysis is associated with inhibition of c-Myc, but does not involve inhibition of mTOR activity under these conditions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>20941</offset><text>Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis contributes to the immune-suppressive effects of 1,25D</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21029</offset><text>To determine whether the suppression of glycolysis by 1,25D contributed to its immunomodulatory effects on T cells, CD4+ T cells were cultured in the presence of 0, 1, or 10 nM 1,25D in either normal, glucose-containing medium, or medium where glucose had been replaced with 10 mM galactose. Conversion of galactose to glucose consumes two molecules of ATP, so that subsequent glycolysis cannot yield any net ATP. This shifts metabolic activity away from aerobic glycolysis and towards OXPHOS. Studies were therefore carried out to determine if 1,25D is still able to exert suppressive effects on IFN-gamma in the absence of aerobic glycolysis. Consistent with previous observations, levels of IFN-gamma were lower in supernatants of control CD4+ T cells cultured in galactose-containing medium than those cultured in normal glucose-containing medium (Figure 3a). Additionally, the inhibitory effect of 1 nM 1,25D on IFN-gamma expression was substantially blunted in galactose-containing medium: a mean suppression of 60% in glucose-containing medium was reduced to 25% in galactose-containing medium (Figure 3b). These data indicate that suppression of aerobic glycolysis by 1 nM 1,25D substantially contributes to its inhibition of IFN-gamma. This effect was not apparent at 10 nM 1,25D (Figure 3a,b), suggesting that transcriptional repression of the IFNG locus in presence of 1,25D is dominant at this dose. Indeed, at 10 nM 1,25D, we see almost complete suppression of IFN-gamma at both an mRNA and protein level, compared to a lesser suppression with 1 nM (Figures 1a and S4A). A recent study has identified several 1,25D-induced transcription factors in T cells that may mediate this transcriptional repression, including c-Jun, STAT3 and BACH2, with BACH2 appearing to play a particularly important role. Consistent with the lack of effect of 1,25D on mitochondrial oxidative capacity (Figure 1b), neither addition of exogenous pyruvate, nor acetate:which can directly substitute for glucose-derived acetyl-CoA to regulate IFN-gamma transcription:could rescue the inhibitory effect of 1,25D on IFN-gamma expression (Figure 3a,c,d).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>23169</offset><text>DISCUSSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23180</offset><text>It is widely reported that 1,25D can directly inhibit T-cell inflammatory function, including suppression of cytokines such as IFN-gamma. Here, we have shown that this effect is associated with the suppression of glycolytic metabolism by 1,25D in activated CD4+ T cells. Employing in-depth metabolic tracing approaches, we found that 1,25D significantly inhibited the conversion of glucose to lactate by aerobic glycolysis in CD4+ T cells, and to a lesser extent glucose oxidation in the TCA cycle. This was associated with repression of c-Myc expression, although knockdown studies would be required to confirm a causative role for this. We observed no change in mTOR activity upstream of c-Myc and this suppression also occurred independently of effects of 1,25D on IL-2 expression; however, other regulators of c-Myc, such as T-cell receptor signalling were not investigated. Additionally, the effect of 1,25D may be mediated by direct transcriptional repression of Myc, a mechanism reported in other cell types.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24196</offset><text>Recent studies have identified a positive feedback loop between lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) activity and PI3K/Akt signalling in T cells, with LDHA-generated ATP critically supporting PI3K signalling and thereby further promoting metabolic reprogramming. Since LDHA expression is controlled by c-Myc, it is possible this feed-forward loop is also inhibited by 1,25D, and would be of interest to interrogate in future studies. Other genes under transcriptional control by c-Myc include those involved in glutaminolysis. Glutamine uptake, metabolism and oxidation in the TCA cycle play a significant role supporting T-cell activation and immune function. Therefore, diminished c-Myc driven activity of this pathway could represent an additional 1,25D-mediated metabolic inhibition in T cells. Whilst we did not investigate this, we did notably observe decreased rates of mitochondrial oxygen consumption in 1,25D-treated cells, despite no clear reduction in glucose oxidation in the TCA cycle. It is plausible therefore that this observed change in mitochondrial oxygen consumption relates to the suppressed oxidation of other TCA cycle substrates, such as glutamine or fatty acids. By activating CD4+ T cells in presence of galactose rather than glucose, which effectively inhibits aerobic glycolysis and promotes oxidative metabolism, we identified that the suppression of aerobic glycolysis substantially contributes to the inhibitory activity of 1,25D on IFN-gamma expression at 1 nM 1,25D, but not at 10 nM. 1,25D exposure leads to repressed transcription of IFN-gamma, through altered expression and activity of several transcription factors, notably BACH2, which is likely the prevailing mechanism seen at the higher concentration. However, with less transcriptional repression at the lower concentration, 1,25D-mediated suppression of aerobic glycolysis is an additional contributor to the inhibition of IFN-gamma. As there was little effect of 1,25D on mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and the addition of acetate to the culture was unable to rescue IFN-gamma production, it is inferable that this inhibition is mediated post-translationally by GAPDH rather than via reduced acetyl-CoA availability limiting histone acetylation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26435</offset><text>Prior investigations have shown 1,25D promotes fatty acid synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, c-Myc transcription, and glycolysis in TolDCs during differentiation from monocytes, this appears in contradiction to the suppressive effects on CD4+ T cell metabolism seen here. The mechanisms for these differing effects remain unclear. However, it is probable that 1,25D has different targets in each cell type. For example, c-Myc is induced by 1,25D in TolDCs through increased mTOR activity, which we do not see in CD4+ T cells. The divergent effects of 1,25D on DC and T cell metabolism may also reflect the adaptability of vitamin D in the setting of antigen-presentation and T cell function. The predominant mode of action for vitamin D in antigen-presenting cells such as DC is intracrine through endogenous generation of 1,25D from precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25D). In this setting, DC expressing the vitamin D receptor (VDR) respond to locally generated 1,25D by promote a tolerogenic phenotype that is associated with enhanced glycolysis, OXPHOS, and TCA metabolism. However, in the presence of elevated levels of 25D, intracrine-generated 1,25D may exit the DC and interact with VDR-expressing T cells within the local immune microenvironment. The effect of 1,25D in this paracrine setting is also tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory but data presented in this study indicate that this is associated with entirely different metabolic programming to that observed for intracrine effect of 1,25D on DC. This flexibility in metabolic regulation by 1,25D in DC and T cells may help to provide a more robust immune response, particularly under conditions of vitamin D repletion.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28119</offset><text>Heterogenous populations of bulk CD4+ T cells are used in this study, including Tregs which have a markedly different metabolism to Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells. Future studies may investigate whether 1,25D-mediated metabolic suppression has stronger functional effects on individual subsets, namely Th1 and Th17 cells, which rely heavily on glycolysis. We have only explored the effect of 1,25D on CD4+ T-cell monocultures. However, T cell exposure to 1,25D in vivo is dependent on APCs, with APCs synthesizing increased 1,25D in response to T cells. It remains unclear how metabolic effects of 1,25D on both cell types may affect APC/T cell interactions and function. Here, we focussed our investigation on the control of CD4+ T cell IFN-gamma expression, since this is known to be closely linked to metabolic activity. However, there are likely additional implications of 1,25D-mediated metabolic suppression for T cells. For example, inhibition of glycolysis may impair their survival, motility, and other immune functions, particularly in hypoxic and glucose-deprived tissue environments. Overall, understanding metabolic aspects of 1,25D-mediated immune regulation will aid to define its potential for therapeutic use, and may inform novel strategies in combination with metabolic mediators.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>29412</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon
