Specifically, only a handful of cellular proteins have been shown to be involved in the RNA replication cycle of these viruses. In an effort to isolate and identify additional cellular proteins that function in enteroviral RNA replication, we have generated multiple recombinant polioviruses containing RNA affinity tags within the 3â² or 5â² noncoding region of the genome. These recombinant viruses retained RNA affinity sequences within the genome while remaining viable and infectious over multiple passages in cell culture. Further characterization of these viruses demonstrated that viral protein production and growth kinetics were unchanged or only slightly altered relative to wild type poliovirus. However, attempts to isolate these genetically-tagged viral genomes from infected cells have been hindered by high levels of co-purification of nonspecific proteins and the limited matrix-binding efficiency of RNA affinity sequences. Regardless, these recombinant viruses represent a step toward more thorough characterization of enterovirus ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in RNA replication.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1366</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1382</offset><text>The Picornaviridae family of viruses is a group of small, non-enveloped viruses that contain single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA genomes. Picornaviruses are significant pathogens of humans because they are widespread and capable of causing serious diseases such as poliomyelitis, hepatitis, meningitis, and encephalitis as well as less serious diseases including the common cold. The enteroviruses are a single genera within the picornavirus family, of which poliovirus is the type species. Due to the inherent limited protein coding capacity of their small RNA genomes, enteroviruses require the functions of cellular proteins to complete their infectious cycle. Because enteroviral replication is composed of a series of discrete steps that demand particular protein functions, there are dynamic changes to the composition of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes throughout this cycle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2270</offset><text>Much of what is known about the identity of cellular proteins that are usurped during the replication cycle of enteroviruses is a result of studies involving poliovirus. The poliovirus genome consists of a small viral protein (VPg) covalently linked to the RNA at the very 5â² terminus followed by a relatively long (742 nucleotide) and highly structured 5â² noncoding region (5â²NCR). There are six stem-loop (S-L I-VI) structures within the 5â²NCR, with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) comprised of S-L II-VI. Downstream of the 5â²NCR the poliovirus genome encodes a single open reading frame. The 3â² region of the genome contains the ~75 nucleotide 3â² noncoding region (3â²NCR), made up of two predicted stem-loop structures called X and Y, and the genetically encoded poly(A) tract of ~60 nucleotides. The function of the 3â²NCR is not clear, but the poly(A) tract is required for infectivity and is the putative binding site for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) during initiation of negative-sense RNA synthesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3321</offset><text>Following cellular entry and uncoating, the initial step in the replication cycle of poliovirus is the translation of the ~7500 nucleotide genomic RNA molecule in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Unlike cellular mRNAs, the poliovirus genome lacks a 5â² 7-methylguanosine cap structure and relies on cap-independent, IRES-mediated translation resulting in the production of a single 250-kDa polyprotein. The polyprotein is proteolytically processed by viral proteinases to produce 11 mature proteins, as well as intermediate precursor proteins, which have distinct functions. In addition to generating the proteins required for viral RNA replication directly, translation of the viral genome also produces proteins that alter the infected cell to support conditions required for viral RNA synthesis. This includes induction of membranous structures that originate from the secretory pathway and/or autophagosomal pathways during infection. Viral RNA is synthesized in close association with these membranous structures induced during infection, and are together known as replication complexes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4418</offset><text>Once sufficient levels of viral proteins have been produced, the genomic RNA that was a template for translation is subsequently used as a template for the generation of viral RNA molecules. This involves a template usage switch that is dependent, in part, upon cleavage of the host-cell protein polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB1) and/or poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), by the viral proteinase 3CD. Poliovirus RNA replication can be divided into two distinct stages: (i) the production of negative-sense RNA intermediates from genomic RNA templates and (ii) the synthesis of nascent genomic RNAs (positive-sense RNA molecules) from negative-sense templates. Due to the asymmetric nature of enterovirus RNA replication, the ratio of positive- to negative-sense RNAs within an infected cell is approximately 50:1. Consequently, the majority of viral RNA in infected cells is single-stranded and positive-sense. Poliovirus RNA replication is dependent upon the formation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that result from interactions between structured regions of the viral RNA molecule and proteins of host and viral origin. The RNA structures that nucleate various RNP complexes are found in the positive-sense RNA within in the 5â² NCR, the cis-acting replication element (cre) (a hairpin structure found within the coding region of 2C involved in the initiation of RNA synthesis), and the 3â²NCR. RNP complexes function in stimulating viral RNA replication, through direct or indirect recruitment of 3Dpol, and are thought to be the determinants of 3Dpol template specificity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6017</offset><text>The RNA structural element known as the cloverleaf or S-L I, located at the very 5â² terminus of poliovirus genomic RNA, is required for efficient synthesis of negative-sense viral RNA, by acting as a scaffold for protein associations. Poliovirus proteinase/polymerase precursor 3CD and host protein PCBP2 interact with the S-L I structure forming a ternary complex on the 5â² terminus of the template. On the opposite end of the same RNA molecule, poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) associates with the 3â² poly(A) tract. Because PABP1 has been shown to interact with both PCBP2 as well as 3CD, the current model of negative-sense RNA synthesis is based on the circularization of the genomic template through interaction of the proteins present in the ternary complex and PABP1. End-to-end interaction is predicted to bring 3Dpol (perhaps in the form of 3CD that is bound to S-L I) into close proximity to the site of replication initiation at the 3â² terminus of the template RNA. Many features of this model have been verified in vitro, and the specificity of 3Dpol for viral RNA templates containing these RNP complexes is bolstered by the requirement for translation in cis, i.e., a viral RNA template must be translated before being used for RNA replication. As a result, RNA templates enter the replication cycle already associated with various cellular proteins that function in the translation of the viral genome, and may also be required for efficient RNA replication. Because negative-sense RNA templates are not translated, they likely have a unique set of viral and host protein requirements compared to their genomic RNA counterparts. Previous studies have identified a cellular protein that promotes positive-sense RNA synthesis: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNP C1/C2). hnRNP C1/C2 interacts with RNA sequences that correspond to both the 5â² and 3â² terminal regions of negative-sense RNA intermediates (regions complementary to the 3â²NCR and 5â²NCR of genomic RNA, respectively). The association of hnRNP C1/C2 with both termini of the negative-sense RNA molecule has been proposed to promote the end-to-end interaction of this RNA species through multimerization of hnRNP C1/C2 isoforms. Newly synthesized positive-sense RNA molecules are subsequently used as templates for translation, recycled back into the RNA replication cycle, or packaged into viral capsids producing progeny virions that are released from the cell.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8488</offset><text>Studies that have contributed to our understanding of enterovirus RNA replication have defined several proteins that interact directly with poliovirus RNA during the process of viral RNA production. However, previous work has relied heavily on in vitro assays and subgenomic poliovirus RNA constructs. To define the RNP complexes using full length genomic RNA in the context of infection, we have generated recombinant polioviruses containing RNA affinity tags within the noncoding regions of the genome. The use of polioviruses possessing stable, specifically isolatable genomes and replication intermediates could ultimately allow for strand-specific RNP complex characterization directly from infected cells, throughout the course of infection. Here we present a biological characterization of these recombinant viruses and demonstrate that exogenous sequence insertions can be stable in the poliovirus genome for multiple passages in cell culture while maintaining wild type-like growth kinetics. Our initial attempts to isolate these genetically-tagged viral RNAs and associated proteins from infected cells has been hampered by high levels of co-purification of nonspecific proteins and the limited binding efficiency between RNA affinity sequences and their respective matrices. Nonetheless, our results provide a foundation for the generation of enteroviruses that could eventually allow for a description of the dynamic changes in protein composition of viral RNP complexes that occur throughout the course of infection, and that reflect the distinct steps of the viral RNA replication cycle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>10090</offset><text>2.

To generate plasmids encoding MS2 tags in place of the 3â²NCR, a HpaI site corresponding to nucleotide position 7378 in pT7PV1 was engineered into the pT7PV1(â3â²NCR) plasmid. Oligonucleotides corresponding to tandem MS2 hairpins were inserted into pT7PV1(â3â²NCR)HpaI at the HpaI site using blunt end ligation to generate pT7PV1-3â²MS2 plasmid (MS2 stem-loop sequence obtained from SP73-Î²globin-(MS2)4, kindly provided by Klemens Hertel (University of California, Irvine, CA, USA)). To generate plasmids encoding either the S1 or D8 aptamer tags in forward or reverse orientation, or the modified forms of these aptamers, within the 5â²NCR of the poliovirus genome, three separate vectors were used. For constructs containing aptamer tag in place of S-L VI, the X585R plasmid was engineered to contain an XhoI site at nucleotide position 564 (X585RXhoI). For generating aptamer tags in place of S-L III, and at nucleotide position 702, pT7PV1 was digested with HincII and re-ligated to generate a subclone of this vector. XhoI sites were inserted flanking S-L III or at nucleotide position 702. These subclones, and X585RXhoI, were digested with XhoI then ligated with double stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each one of the tag sequences containing XhoI recognition sites (Table 1). Tagged subclones were then ligated into full-length poliovirus cDNA constructs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-t001.xml</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-t001</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>11744</offset><text>Oligonucleotides corresponding to aptamer tag sequences incorporated into the 5â² noncoding region (5â²NCR) of the poliovirus genome cDNA.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-t001.xml</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-t001</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

Following transcription, RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by two rounds of ethanol precipitation in the presence of 700 mM ammonium acetate or by using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For transfection of RNA into HeLa cells, 1 Î¼g of transcribed RNA was incubated with TS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.68 mM CaCl2, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5) and 1 mg/mL DEAE-Dextran. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 250 Î¼L of Diethylaminoethyl(DEAE)-Dextran transfection mixture was added per 20 cm2 plate of HeLa cells. After 30 min incubation at room temperature, DMEM-8% NCS was added and cells were incubated at 37 Â°C and monitored for cytopathic effects (CPE). CPE was observed after 4 days for MS2-containing RNA transfections or after 1 day for RNAs containing aptamer tags in the 5â²NCR. Following detection of CPE, cells and supernatant were collected, subjected to 3-5 freeze-thaw cycles, and used to infect HeLa cell monolayers with a semi-solid agar overlay (DMEM-6% NCS, 0.45% agarose). Single plaque isolates were recovered at 2 (aptamer-tagged RNA transfections) or 4 (MS2-tagged RNA transfections) days post-infection and used to infect fresh HeLa cell monolayers. The resulting virus was designated as passage 1. Virus was amplified by serial passage at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 in HeLa cell monolayers. Large-scale virus preparations of PV1-3âMS2 were generated for passages 3 and 4 using HeLa suspension cells (400 mL). Cells were pelleted, washed once with PBS, washed once with S-MEM, and infected at an MOI of 0.2 in 370 mL S-MEM. After 30 min adsorption at room temperature, NCS was added to 10% and infection was allowed to proceed at 37 Â°C for 11 h. Cells were pelleted at ~1500 relative centrifugal units (rcf), resuspended in 25 mL DMEM, and subjected to five freeze-thaw cycles to release virus. Large-scale preparations of D8+/D8â/S1+/S1â/D8m+/D8mâ702PV1 were generated for passage 3 stocks using HeLa suspension cells (1 liter). Cells were pelleted, washed once with PBS, resuspended with S-MEM and infected at an MOI of 20. After 30 min adsorption at room temperature, NCS was added to 8% by volume and infection was allowed to proceed for 8 h. Cell cultures and fluids were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles prior to centrifugation at ~1500 rcf. For single-cycle growth analysis, HeLa cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS and infected with wild type PV1, PV1-3â²MS2, or D8+/D8â/S1+/S1â/D8m+/D8mâ702PV1 at an MOI of 20 for 30 min at room temperature.

HeLa S10 (60% of total volume) was incubated with 250 or 500 ng of in vitro transcribed RNA constructs corresponding to aptamer-tagged viral genomes or poliovirus virion RNA (vRNA), 35S-methionine (PerkinElmer), and all-four buffer (1 mM ATP, 0.25 mM GTP, 0.25 mM UTP, 0.25 mM CTP, 60 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM creatine phosphate, 0.4 mg/mL creatine kinase, 15.5 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4]). Translation was allowed to proceed at 30 Â°C for 5â6 h. 2X LSB was added to an equal volume of translation reaction and boiled for 3 min. Samples were then subjected to electrophoresis on an SDS-containing 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography following fluorography.

Thus, our initial studies focused on the generation of recombinant poliovirus containing RNA sequence corresponding to tandem bacteriophage MS2 hairpins, which is of similar length to the 3â²NCR itself, in place of the 3â²NCR of the genome. The MS2 affinity purification assay is a well-established method for the purification of RNA-protein complexes via the high affinity (Kd ~ 1â3 Ã 10â9 M) interaction between the MS2 coat protein and a stem-loop structure within the phage genome, known as the operator or MS2 hairpin, and has been utilized for the purification of RNP complexes associated with long RNAs from cellular extracts. To generate a recombinant poliovirus containing these RNA affinity sequences within the genome (PV1-3â²MS2, Figure 1A), RNA was transcribed in vitro and transfected into HeLa cell monolayers with a liquid overlay. Overlays were harvested upon the observation of cytopathic effects and used to infect HeLa cells for plaque purification and screening. Recombinant virus containing the MS2 RNA hairpins was isolated and virus stocks were generated by amplification in cell culture. To confirm the presence of the tandem MS2 tags in the viral genome, RT-PCR with one of two primers directed against the MS2 hairpin sequence was used to amplify the 3â terminal 850 nucleotides of the viral RNA following each passage in cell culture. The exogenous sequence insertion within PV1-3â²MS2 was stable for at least six passages (Figure 1B).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g001.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f001</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>29343</offset><text>The generation of a recombinant poliovirus containing MS2 hairpins in place of the 3â²NCR.

The only non-synonymous mutation that arose in the genome of PV1-3â²MS2 was a phenylalanine-to-serine mutation at amino acid 120 of the capsid protein VP3. This mutation is located at the terminus of one beta strand on the internal side of an 8-stranded anti-parallel beta barrel that forms the poliovirus capsid. It is not clear whether this mutation has any effect on the structure of VP3, since it is located on the surface-exposed beta barrel adjacent to an invariable loop region. An additional tyrosine-to-histidine mutation emerged within 3Dpol at amino acid position 15. However, this mutation was also observed following sequencing of the original cDNA used to transcribe RNA for transfection and isolation of virus, and therefore is not a relevant compensatory mutation within the PV1-3âMS2 genome.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>31521</offset><text>3.1.2.

Third passage stocks of PV1-3â²MS2 or wild type poliovirus were used to infect HeLa cell monolayers, and cells and cell culture fluids were collected every 2 h to measure virus production over the course of infection. The PV1-3â²MS2 recombinant virus showed a 2 log10 reduction in viral titer and a 2 h delay in peak virus production, which occurs at around 4 h post-infection for wild type poliovirus. The growth deficiency in the genetically-tagged virus was also evidenced by the small plaque phenotype of PV1-3â²MS2 when compared to wild type poliovirus (Figure 2B). Because a mutant poliovirus lacking the 3â²NCR sequence within its genome (Î3â²NCR PV1) demonstrates a similar growth defect compared to wild type poliovirus, the lack of the 3â²NCR sequence is likely responsible for the limited virus production from PV1-3â²MS2, rather than the presence of the tandem MS2 RNA sequence itself. Furthermore, negative-sense RNA levels produced during infection with Î3â²NCR PV1 are comparable to levels observed during wild type poliovirus infection, but Î3â²NCR PV1 synthesizes significantly lower levels of positive-sense RNA compared to wild type. By extension, we predict that the growth defect observed during PV1-3â²MS2 infection is a result of limitations to positive-strand RNA production as a result of the negative-strand template RNA lacking the 5â² terminal region, the complement to the positive-strand 3â²NCR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g002.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f002</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>33234</offset><text>PV1-3â²MS2 recombinant virus growth kinetics and plaque morphology.

Viral protein production was examined via immunofluorescence detection of the viral protein 3A in cells infected with PV1-3â²MS2 or wild type poliovirus (Figure 3A). Viral protein 3A and its precursor 3AB are nonstructural proteins involved, in part, in the formation of membranous structures that are the sites of viral RNA replication. In wild type poliovirus-infected cells, 3A was detected by 2 h post-infection, with increased production of 3A observed 4 h post-infection. Deterioration of the nucleus, detected at 6 h post-infection with wild type poliovirus, is representative of cytopathic effects. In contrast, the presence of viral protein 3A was not detected in cells at 2 h post-infection with PV1-3â²MS2, and 3A is not observed in infected cells until 4 h post-infection, reflecting the 2 h delay in virus growth observed by single-cycle growth analysis. Furthermore, cytopathic effects are not observed until 8 h post-infection with PV1-3â²MS2. Accumulation of viral translation products was also examined over the course of infection by 35S-methionine labeling of viral proteins during the infectious cycle (Figure 3B). Because poliovirus infection results in the inhibition of cap-dependent translation through cleavage of canonical translation initiation factors, cellular protein production is inhibited in infected cells, resulting in the incorporation of radiolabeled methionine only in viral proteins (compare background proteins in lane 1 to lane 2). Viral proteins are readily apparent by 3 h post-infection with wild type poliovirus, but very few viral proteins are detected by 3 h post-infection with PV1-3â²MS2. Additionally, complete shut down of cellular translation is delayed until 4 h post-infection with recombinant virus (compare Figure 3B lane 1 to lanes 6 and 7), confirming the delay in viral processes observed by single-cycle growth analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g003.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f003</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>36442</offset><text>PV1-3âMS2 displays a delay in viral protein production and cytopathic effects.

In an effort to increase the detection of transient and dynamic protein-RNA interactions that occur during infection, infected cells were subjected to 0.4% formaldehyde cross-linking prior to the generation of NP-40 lysates. To generate MS2 affinity resin for purification of MS2-tagged viral RNA, recombinant MS2 coat protein fused to maltose binding protein (MBP-MS2) was incubated with amylose resin and subsequently blocked with tRNA and bovine serum albumin to limit nonspecific interactions (Figure 4A).

Three proteins known to bind poliovirus RNA were enriched in purified samples from PV1-3â²MS2-infected cells compared to purifications from wild type poliovirus-infected cells (Figure 5AâC; compare lane 3 to lane 4). The cellular protein PABP1 was specifically purified in association with PV1-3â²MS2 (Figure 5A), and has been proposed to play a role in viral replication via its interaction with the poly(A) tract of the poliovirus genome. Another protein with a role in poliovirus RNA synthesis that was enriched by MS2 purification, hnRNP C1/C2, has been shown to interact with RNA sequences corresponding to both the 5â² and 3â² terminal regions of negative-sense poliovirus RNA (Figure 5B). Although hnRNP C1/C2 binding to positive-sense poliovirus RNA molecules has not been demonstrated, it may be purified from infected cells through isolation of partially double-stranded replicative form or multi-stranded replicative intermediate complexes containing both polarities of poliovirus RNA, which form during viral RNA replication. Furthermore, a recently identified negative regulator of poliovirus replication, AU-rich element RNA-binding protein 1 (AUF1, also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D0), was also co-purified with PV1-3â²MS2 RNA, albeit at low levels, presumably through its interaction with the 5â²NCR of poliovirus RNA. These results demonstrate that isolation of PV1-3â²MS2 RNA from infected cells allows for the enrichment of proteins known to interact with poliovirus RNA molecules and which carry out distinct functions within the viral RNA replication cycle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g005.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f005</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>42502</offset><text>Cellular proteins with known roles in poliovirus replication co-purify with PV1-3â²MS2 RNA.

Because the replication cycle of PV1-3â²MS2 is delayed by 2 h (Figure 3), lysates from infected cells were generated at 4, 5, and 6 h post-infection to make up for this delay as well as to identify changes in RNP composition that may reflect different stages of the viral replication cycle. We observed some nonspecific isolation of proteins associated with the MS2 affinity purification of wild type RNA and associated proteins from infected cells (Figure 6, lane 4). However, an increased amount of co-purified proteins was detected in samples from PV1-3â²MS2-infected cells at 5 h post-infection, with even higher levels of co-purified proteins observed by 6 h post-infection (Figure 6, lanes 6 and 7). Whether the apparent increase in the amount and diversity of proteins enriched upon PV1-3â²MS2 RNA purification represents an authentic increase in the diversity of proteins that make up poliovirus RNP complexes at later times during infection, or mainly a consequence of increased abundance of viral RNA and consequent increases in co-isolated proteins, remains to be determined. In an attempt to characterize the complete composition of the RNP complexes isolated via the MS2 RNA hairpins present in the PV1-3â²MS2 genome, purified fractions were digested with trypsin and peptides were identified by mass spectrometry. Results from purification of lysates from PV1-3â²MS2-infected cells were compared to results from purification of lysates from wild type poliovirus-infected cells to verify specific interactions. Analysis of those proteins purified from wild type poliovirus-infected cells revealed a high background of nonspecific interactions using our current purification procedure. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that the total number of proteins identified as well as the relative composition of proteins categorized by molecular function were nearly identical regardless of the presence of the tandem MS2 hairpin RNA tag during purification (data not shown). Proteins nonspecifically purified from lysates of both recombinant and wild type poliovirus-infected cells include components of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, serine/arginine-rich splicing factors, and peptides corresponding to viral proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that our MS2 RNA affinity purification needs to be further refined to allow for the identification of cellular components that function in poliovirus RNA replication, especially relative to the sensitivity of mass spectrometry analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g006.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f006</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>45885</offset><text>Analysis of proteins isolated by MS2 affinity purification.

Aptamers developed to specifically bind streptavidin or Sephadex, a cross-linked dextran gel used in size-exclusion chromatography, were selected as affinity sequences for subsequent purifications. These RNA sequences are short: the consensus S1, streptavidin-binding aptamer is 44 nucleotides in length and the D8, Sephadex-binding aptamer is 33 nucleotides long. Because large sequence insertions presumably incur a fitness cost on recombinant viral genomes, and because we were interested in generating viruses with as close to wild type replication kinetics as possible, the length of the sequence was a major determinant in our selection of affinity tag. These aptamer tags were also appealing because of their potential for RNP complex isolation and subsequent characterization, as has been previously demonstrated for cellular mRNAs and rRNAs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>48152</offset><text>There are four known regions within the 5â²NCR of the poliovirus genome that have previously been shown to tolerate major sequence alterations: S-L III, S-L VI, nucleotide position 600 through 726 (including a portion of S-L VI), and just downstream of nucleotide position 702. Deletions of these S-L regions or insertions of up to 72 nucleotides at position 702 produces mutant viruses that have essentially wild type growth kinetics and yields, with only slight delays in RNA synthesis. Based on the results of these previous studies, we separately introduced the minimal D8 and S1 motifs into three different locations within the poliovirus 5â²NCR: in place of S-L III, in place of S-L VI, or at nucleotide position 702 (Figure 7). These aptamer tags were engineered into these sites in a forward or reverse orientation within a poliovirus cDNA construct, subsequently allowing for the D8 or S1 RNA sequence motif to be present in the viral positive- or negative-strand RNA, respectively, potentially allowing for strand-specific RNP complex isolation. This resulted in the production of 12 plasmid constructs: three constructs harboring the D8 tag at the three separate sites for positive-strand isolation (D8+S-LIII, D8+S-LVI, D8+702), three constructs harboring the D8 tag for negative-strand isolation (D8âS-LIII, D8âS-LVI, D8â702), and the corresponding six constructs containing the S1 nucleotide sequence (S1+S-LIII, S1+S-LVI, S1+702, S1âS-LIII, S1âS-LVI, S1â702).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g007.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f007</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>49641</offset><text>Schematic of poliovirus genomic RNAs containing S1 and D8 aptamer tags within the highly structured 5â²NCR, for positive-strand isolation.

In agreement with previous studies that suggest the introduction of an AUG triplet into the highly variable region between S-L VI and the start codon of the poliovirus genome is deleterious for viral replication, the S1+702 construct, which contains an AUG triplet in-frame with the translation start codon at position 743, showed an altered protein profile compared to wild type poliovirus RNA translation. This in-frame AUG triplet likely leads to alterations in authentic translation initiation, producing amino-terminal extensions on viral proteins P1, 1ABC, and VP0.

Recombinant viral genomes were subjected to RT-PCR with primers designed to amplify the 5â²NCR and sequenced to examine the stability of the tag insertions after the second and third passage in cell culture. D8+702PV1, D8â702PV1, and S1-702PV1 viruses contained intact aptamer sequence after both the second and third passage in cell culture, with no other alterations to the 5â²NCR. The S1+ 702PV1 recombinant virus, in contrast, did not retain the S1 streptavidin affinity tag sequence without alterations. The in-frame AUG triplet within the S1 aptamer sequence was selected against during infection, with three distinct alterations to the AUG triplet observed in four separate isolates. Importantly, only the adenosine residue of the AUG triplet within the S1 aptamer sequence is conserved within the consensus sequence of the multiple streptavidin-binding aptamer sequences first identified. Thus, a viral isolate containing a single nucleotide change, a guanosine-to-uridine transversion at the third position of the triplet (S1+702AUUPV1), was selected as the recombinant virus possessing a streptavidin-binding genome to use in subsequent assays. This single nucleotide alteration within the S1 tag was stable within the poliovirus genome through three passages in cell culture, demonstrated by sequencing progressive passages of virus isolates. In vitro translation assays incorporating an S1+702 in vitro transcribed RNA containing the transversion observed within the S1+702AUUPV1 genome showed a wild type protein profile for this altered construct (data not shown), supporting the idea that the insertion of an in-frame AUG is unfavorable for viral protein production.

Aptamer-tagged RNA isolation was first performed in vitro, as described in Walker, et al., 2008 (Figure 10A). In vitro transcribed poliovirus RNAs for positive-strand isolation were generated and renatured by heating and slow cooling. Aptamer binding was carried out under rotation at 4 Â°C for 4 h, followed by separation of matrix material through centrifugation, and then the Sephadex or streptavidin-conjugated bead matrix was washed multiple times. RNA associations with insoluble matrix were determined by direct loading of the matrix onto an agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and performing electrophoresis (Figure 10B). The specificity of each construct containing the relevant aptamer tag insertion parallels the level of viral proteins produced in the in vitro translation assay shown in Figure 8. This suggests that not only is the nucleotide position 702 insertion site most favorable for the generation of a viable, genetically-tagged virus, but also for matrix accessibility and, as a result, most efficient isolation. Importantly, non-specific interactions between the RNA containing an irrelevant affinity sequence and no affinity sequence (i.e., wild type RNA) were limited (lanes 4 and 5 in both panels of Figure 10B), with the Sephadex matrix showing less background RNA associations than streptavidin beads. Although there appears to be specific association between aptamer-tagged RNAs and the respective matrix, the binding efficiency of these aptamers is very low, as the flow-through from tagged RNA purifications contains similar amounts of RNA compared to untagged, wild type RNA (see lanes 6 and 7 in Figure 10B). Furthermore, elution of tagged RNAs from either matrix is limited, likely due to the minimal amount of tagged RNA associated with the matrix following binding and wash steps (data not shown).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">viruses-08-00039-g010.jpg</infon><infon key="id">viruses-08-00039-f010</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>59650</offset><text>In vitro transcribed affinity-tagged RNA isolation.

In addition to adjusting affinity sequences from MS2 hairpins to aptamers, we also explored alternative genomic locations to the 3â²NCR for insertion of these purification tags. The replication defect of polioviruses lacking the 3âNCR of the genome, including PV1-3â²MS2, is thought to be a result of the absence of the complementary 5â² terminal region within the negative-sense intermediate RNA. This region, although not strictly required for viral replication, has been proposed to be a binding site for hnRNP C1/C2, allowing for efficient positive-sense RNA synthesis to take place. Therefore, this recombinant virus was not ideal for identifying other proteins that may bind the 3â²NCR of the poliovirus genome. Moreover, the coding region of the poliovirus genome is obviously restricted in its ability to tolerate exogenous nucleic acid insertions throughout its length due to the potential of altered viral protein production from disruptions to translation reading frame and/or irregular polyprotein processing. While there are examples of viable, recombinant polioviruses containing nucleic acid sequence insertions within the coding region of genomes to generate fusion or tagged viral proteins, these genomes are only quasi-stable. To overcome the replication defect observed with PV1-3â²MS2, the inherent deficiency this recombinant virus might offer in identifying proteins that interact with the genomic 3â²NCR or negative-strand intermediate 5â² terminal region, and to promote the generation of a stable genome that could allow for growth kinetics that more closely matched wild type poliovirus, we focused on the 5â²NCR to identify potential aptamer tag sequence insertion sites. While interference with regulatory RNA regions within the 5â²NCR was a concern, there are several regions within the 5â²NCR of the poliovirus genome that have previously been shown to tolerate sequence alterations with limited effects to viral replication processes. Nucleic acid sequences generated via systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to bind with high affinity to streptavidin (S1) or Sephadex (D8) were selected due to their short length and demonstrated potential for RNP complex isolation. We tested three separate sites within the 5â²NCR of the poliovirus genome: S-L III, S-L VI, and nucleotide position 702 for their capacity to tolerate aptamer insertions while maintaining biological activity. Making use of these regions, we generated poliovirus RNA constructs containing either of the two aptamer tags within the 5â²NCR, in either a forward or reverse orientation to allow for aptamer sequences to be present in viral genomic RNAs or replication intermediate negative-strand RNAs and to permit strand-specific isolation from infected cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>71129</offset><text>We initiated the RNP complex isolation study focused on the minimal, consensus sequences of the D8 and S1 aptamer tags with the rationale that their short length would be amenable to the production of recombinant virus containing a stable, RNA affinity-tagged genome. However, we observed insufficient RNA isolation efficiency associated with the S1 and D8 RNA affinity tags, and a loss of all specificity associated with these tags upon formaldehyde treatment. The minimal nature of these tags, particularly in the context of the relatively long poliovirus genomic RNA, likely limits the amount of affinity-tagged RNA that can be isolated. Our results agreed with the recent finding that the binding efficiency of the minimal S1 aptamer offers almost no specificity of isolation relative to an untagged RNA construct. The authors of this latter study presented modified aptamer structures and tandem conformations that allow for up to 15-fold increases in binding efficiencies. However, the best binding efficiencies reported correspond to the inclusion of multiple tags of increased nucleotide length, likely preventing the generation of stable, recombinant poliovirus genomes containing these tags. In an attempt to increase the binding efficiency of the aptamer tags within the poliovirus 5â²NCR, while maintaining the stability of the tags through multiple passages, we increased the stem length of both the D8 and S1 by 16 nucleotides to promote the accessibility of RNA affinity sequence to matrix. However, increasing the stem length of the aptamer tags also proved to be insufficient for isolating poliovirus RNP complexes from infected cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>72783</offset><text>Aside from the identification of the 3âNCR and nucleotide position 702 of the poliovirus genome as amenable sites for the insertion of RNA affinity tags, the generation of recombinant viruses containing these tags, while not yet optimized for RNP complex isolation, revealed insights into the biology of the poliovirus genome. The Mahoney strain of the poliovirus 1 genome contains eight AUG triplets upstream of the authentic translation initiation site at nucleotide position 743, within the 5â²NCR. Kuge and colleagues have previously demonstrated that insertions into the poliovirus genome that contain an AUG triplet resulted in base substitutions to the AUG triplet alone, with no other alterations to the insertion sequence. Our results partially support this finding, in that the AUG triplet present in the S1 aptamer sequence was not tolerated in any of the viral isolates that were sequenced, with single nucleotide changes to this triplet sequence present in all cases. However, the sequence coding for the presence of the S1 aptamer within negative-sense RNA (S1â) also contains an AUG triplet (when present in the genomic RNA molecule) that is out-of-frame with authentic AUG start site. Interestingly, no alterations to protein production levels or polyprotein processing were observed upon in vitro translation of this construct compared to wild type RNA sequence. Whether this can be explained by the presence of a UAA stop codon in-frame with this AUG triplet remains to be seen. Other investigations have suggested that the translational efficiency of picornaviruses depends on the particular spacing between a polypyrimidine tract at nucleotide 558 of the 5â²NCR and one of the cryptic AUG triplets at nucleotide position 586, as well as whether AUG triplets are present within structured or unstructured elements. The function of the multiple AUG sequences upstream of the authentic translation initiation start site remains uncertain, but our work suggests that an additional AUG inserted into the poliovirus genome downstream of nucleotide position 586 is only selected against when this triplet is in-frame with the start codon, even when this AUG is within the structured region of an aptamer.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>75007</offset><text>Our work also indicates that very short oligonucleotide sequences may not be competent for stringent isolation of the RNA when they occur within the context of a long, structured viral genome. Although the region between S-L VI and the translation start site of the poliovirus genome (including nucleotide position 702) is often considered more-or-less unstructured, recent global RNA structure analysis has suggested that this region of the genome may in fact contain higher-order structures. Incorporating aptamer tags within a structured RNA will impact the native structure of that region, and may impact the way in which the inserted sequences are able to make intramolecular contacts, possibly affecting proper secondary structure formation of the tags themselves. It is also possible that RNA affinity tags incorporated into the 5â²NCR of the poliovirus genome are sterically blocked from interacting with affinity matrices due to the highly structured nature of this region. Furthermore, the fact that this region interacts with many different protein species, which promote both viral translation and RNA replication, could lead to further masking of RNA affinity tags, thus blocking these RNA sequences from interacting with the matrix. MS2 coat protein RNA affinity tags within the 3â²NCR of the poliovirus genome should be sufficiently separated from RNA structural elements within the genome, which may aid in the isolation of the tagged RNA, but our work suggests the MS2 RNA affinity purification scheme itself allows for untenable levels of non-specific protein co-isolation. Adding complexity is the fact that poliovirus RNA is at least partially duplexed during RNA replication, obstructing affinity matrix/tag interactions and further complicating isolation schemes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>76795</offset><text>The minimal S1 tag has recently been shown be highly inefficient in regard to its ability to retain RNA on the relevant affinity matrix, as untagged, negative-control RNAs are retained with similar efficiency. Leppek and Stoecklin have demonstrated increased isolation efficiencies with the S1 aptamer by increasing both the stem length of this aptamer as well as the number of tags incorporated into the RNA of interest. Although it would no doubt be advantageous to incorporate multiple aptamer tags in series (and/or at the apex of a stem-loop structure) we were limited in our choice of sequence length and insertion site, due to the constraint that recombinant viral genomes containing RNA affinity tags must recapitulate the biological activities of the wild type poliovirus genome. The fact that there is a maximum size threshold for exogenous sequence insertions into the poliovirus genome before biological activity is affected was evidenced by cloning two modified streptavidin-binding aptamers into the nucleotide 702 region. This construct, S1m+(x2)702, produced the lowest levels of viral proteins of all constructs that were assayed by in vitro translation (Figure 11). Recent work has demonstrated the isolation of poliovirus RNA through infection of a cell line stably expressing uracil phosphoribosyltransferase followed by UV cross-linking and oligonucleotide-directed poly(A) isolation, suggesting that isolation of poliovirus RNA may be more tractable when using complementary oligonucleotide sequences rather than RNA affinity tags.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>78349</offset><text>5. Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>78364</offset><text>Overall, we have demonstrated that recombinant polioviruses containing RNA affinity tags within the noncoding regions of their genome are viable, and that these exogenous sequence insertions are stable for multiple passages in cell culture. Furthermore, we did not identify any significant compensatory mutations throughout the genomes of recombinant viruses as a result of these exogenous sequence insertions. Although we were able to specifically isolate RNA containing these affinity tags from cells infected with recombinant viruses, the efficiency of RNA affinity tag/matrix associations and isolation specificities were not sufficient to allow for the identification of novel cellular proteins that play roles in the RNA replication cycle of enteroviruses. However, the use of different affinity tags in the genomic positions discussed here could allow for this objective to be met in the future. Additionally, it is possible that these recombinant viruses have utility in other applications, such as in visualization of the production of specific polarities of RNA during the infectious cycle via the use of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides complementary to tag sequences present in genomic RNAs or negative-strand intermediates. In summary, the viruses and methods described here represent an initial step toward the isolation of RNP complexes associated with enterovirus RNA replication directly from infected cells, in a strand-specific manner. Investigations utilizing these tools could eventually aid in the identification of cellular proteins that could be specifically targeted by anti-enteroviral therapeutics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>79996</offset><text>Author Contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>80017</offset><text>Bert L.
