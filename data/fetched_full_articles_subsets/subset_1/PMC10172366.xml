The F508del defect can be targeted with pharmacological correctors, such as VX-809 and VX-445, that stabilize CFTR and improve its trafficking to plasma membrane. Using a functional test to evaluate a panel of chemical compounds, we have identified tricyclic pyrrolo-quinolines as novel F508del correctors with high efficacy on primary airway epithelial cells from CF patients. The most effective compound, PP028, showed synergy when combined with VX-809 and VX-661 but not with VX-445. By testing the ability of correctors to stabilize CFTR fragments of different length, we found that VX-809 is effective on the amino-terminal portion of the protein that includes the first membrane-spanning domain (amino acids 1â387). Instead, PP028 and VX-445 only show a stabilizing effect when the second membrane-spanning domain is included (amino acids 1â1181). Our results indicate that tricyclic pyrrolo-quinolines are a novel class of CFTR correctors that, similarly to VX-445, interact with CFTR at a site different from that of VX-809. Tricyclic pirrolo-quinolines may represent novel CFTR correctors suitable for combinatorial pharmacological treatments to treat the basic defect in CF.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1479</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1492</offset><text>Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most frequent recessive genetic diseases, found primarily in Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Such mutations disrupt the expression and/or function of the CFTR chloride channel, a plasma membrane protein present in many types of epithelial cells. Since CFTR is essential for transepithelial anion and water transport in different organs, its loss of function affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, sweat glands, and reproductive system. The most severe manifestations of CF are in the respiratory system, with progressive development of obstructive pulmonary disease due to mucus hypersecretion and bacterial colonization.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2165</offset><text>CFTR is a multi-domain membrane protein belonging to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Starting from the amino-terminus, CFTR is composed by a first membrane spanning domain (MSD1), a cytosolic nucleotide binding domain (NBD1), a regulatory (R) domain, a second membrane spanning domain (MSD2), and a second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2). MSD1 and MSD2, each one consisting of six membrane spanning helices, assemble together to form the pathway for bidirectional anion flux. NBD1 and NBD2 interact with each other forming two separate binding sites for ATP. Binding and hydrolysis of ATP drive cycles of CFTR channel opening and closure. CFTR activity also requires cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of R domain.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2905</offset><text>Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) in the CFTR protein is the most frequent mutation. F508del, which resides in NBD1, has a global negative effect on CFTR folding and stability, resulting in retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and early degradation. F508del also causes an intrinsic defect in channel activity (gating defect). Indeed, if F508del-CFTR is forced to traffic to plasma membrane, by treating cells at low temperature or by overexpression, it shows a reduced time spent in the open chloride-conductive state compared to normal CFTR.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3484</offset><text>The molecular defects caused by F508del and other CFTR mutations can be corrected by small molecules called correctors and potentiators. Correctors, such as VX-809, VX-661, and VX-445 (a.k.a. lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor, respectively), target the misfolding and instability caused by F508del allowing the CFTR protein to reach the plasma membrane. Potentiators, such as VX-770, overcome the channel-gating defect caused by F508del and other mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3948</offset><text>A modest improvement in clinical condition was initially obtained by treating patients homozygous for F508del with a drug combination, named Orkambi, including VX-809 and VX-770. Later, this group of patients showed a similar extent of benefit with a drug combination, named Symdeko in US and Symkevi in Europe, in which VX-809 was replaced by VX-661. A much better therapeutic outcome, particularly on patients with a single copy of F508del, was obtained with a triple drug combination, named Trikafta in US and Kaftrio in Europe, that includes VX-445 in addition to VX-661 and VX-770. The inclusion of a second type of corrector is needed because the mistrafficking caused by F508del cannot be overcome by a single agent. Actually, F508del causes multiple defects to CFTR protein, including intrinsic instability of the nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), where F508del is localized, and altered interaction of NBD1 with other CFTR domains. In this respect, it has been shown that there are at least three classes of correctors. C1 correctors, in particular VX-809 and VX-661, act by interacting with TMD1. C2 correctors, like the bithiazole corr-4a and compound 3151, act on the second half of the CFTR protein. C3 correctors, which include chemical chaperones like glycerol and the small molecules 4172 and VX-445, appear to improve the stability of NBD1. Identification of novel correctors will help in the design of combinatorial treatments targeting F508del and other CF mutations with similar defects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5458</offset><text>The bithiazole corr-4a, identified by high-through screening of maximal diversity chemical library, was one of the first examples of F508del-CFTR correctors. Corr-4a showed potency in the micromolar range and modest efficacy in native airway epithelial cells from CF patients. To improve corrector activity, various chemical modification of the basic bithiazole scaffold have been attempted. One solution was to generate constrained bithiazoles bearing a central ring ranging from 5 to 8 carbon atoms. This modification, i.e. the synthesis of molecules with three fused rings, improved by 50% the maximal efficacy compared to free-rotating bithiazoles. Interestingly, tricyclic molecules have been shown to affect CFTR synthesis and/or function. Psoralens, belonging to the chemical family of linear furocumarins, were found to potentiate CFTR channel activity. Furthemore, 4,6,4â-trimethylangelicin (TMA), an angular furocumarin, is a compound with both potentiator and corrector activity. In the present study, we aimed at further exploring the corrector activity of tricyclic compounds by synthesizing and functionally testing a focused chemical library of nearly 200 compounds. After identification of an active hit, further chemical optimization led to compounds with greatly improved activity and high synergy with C1 correctors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6796</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6804</offset><text>A set of 200 compounds having tricyclic structure were synthesized as heteroanalogues of angular furocumarins.

Cells were incubated for 24Â h with compounds at 10Â ÂµM (Fig.Â 1A). As positive control, cells were separately incubated with the corrector VX-809 (1Â ÂµM). After treatment, compounds were removed and cells were acutely stimulated for 20â30Â min with 20Â ÂµM forskolin (to increase cytosolic cAMP) plus 50Â ÂµM genistein (as a potentiator to further enhance CFTR channel opening). F508del-CFTR activity in the plasma membrane was evaluated by measuring the rate of HS-YFP quenching elicited by extracellular addition of an iodide-rich saline solution. Rescue of F508del-CFTR results in enhanced iodide influx and hence accelerated fluorescence quenching. Only one compound, later labeled as PP007, elicited a relatively modest increase in F508del-CFTR function corresponding toâ~â30% of VX-809 effect (Figs. 1A and 2). PP007 was retested at 1 and 10Â ÂµM in the presence and absence of 1Â ÂµM VX-809 (Fig.Â 1B). Activity was found at 10 but not at 1Â ÂµM. Importantly, the combination of PP007 (1 and 10Â ÂµM) with VX-809 improved F508del-CFTR function with respect to VX-809 alone. In particular, a near doubling of VX-809 rescue was observed when 10Â ÂµM PP007 was included. This interesting result prompted the synthesis and evaluation of a small set of PP007 analogs. A few compounds, having modifications at different positions of the scaffold, were synthesized and tested on CFBE41o- cells with the HS-YFP assay (Figs. 1C and 2). In particular, a bromine atom was introduced at position 3 (PP008), the p-methylbenzyl moiety at the pyrrole nitrogen was replaced by a methyl (PP010) or an unsubstituted benzyl (PP011) group, and the carbonyl of the pyridone moiety replaced by a methoxy group (PP014). Compounds PP008 and PP011 showed significant activity. Importantly, PP008 emerged as a very effective corrector able to markedly synergize with VX-809. We tested PP008 at multiple concentrations in the range 0.01â20Â ÂµM (Fig.Â 3A, top). A maximal rescue, corresponding to nearly 70% of VX-809 effect, was achieved at 10Â ÂµM with an EC50 ofâ~â1.78Â ÂµM. Interestingly, when tested in the presence of VX-809, the EC50 was decreased to 1.05Â ÂµM (Fig.Â 3A, bottom).

The net chloride secretion dependent on F508del-CFTR activity, and hence the efficacy of rescue maneuvers, was estimated from the amplitude of inhibitor effect. FigureÂ 3D shows the results obtained from multiple preparations of bronchial and nasal epithelial cells of F508del/F508del patients.

A series of modifications were introduced into the scaffold of PP008. Replacement of the p-methylbenzyl moiety of PP008 with a m-methylbenzyl group (PP028; Fig.Â 2) resulted in a substantial improvement in potency and efficacy. The enlargement of the central ring to seven carbon atoms (PP048, PP055, and PP056; Fig.Â 2) led to loss of activity. A number of compounds were prepared bearing substituted benzyl moieties at the pyrrole nitrogen; in many cases, these analogues maintained good activity compared with PP028. The SAR studies showed that crucial structural features for maintaining a good corrector activity are the presence of the pyridin-2-one moiety bearing a benzenesulfonyl substituent and of a carboxyl ester group.

The peripheral signal was more evident by treating cells with the PP028/VX-809 combination (Fig.Â 5A).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41598_2023_34440_Fig6_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig6</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>20281</offset><text>Functional evaluation of corrector combinations.

It was ineffective if given alone and modestly enhanced the activity of VX-809 or PP028 when combined with these correctors (Fig.Â 6A). Instead, co-treatment of cells with VX-809 and 4172 generated a large synergic effect (Fig.Â 6B), comparable in size to that obtained with VX-809 plus PP028.

PP028 activity was compared with that of VX-809 and VX-445. We first tested these three correctors on MSD1 fragment (amino acids: 1â387). By immunoblot, we detected two bands of 37 and 30Â kDa, respectively (Fig.Â 7A). The upper band corresponds to the expected molecular size of the MSD1 fragment. The lower band may result from a proteolytic cleavage. We considered the 37Â kDa band for densitometric analysis. As shown in Fig.Â 6A, VX-809, but not PP028 or VX-445, stabilized the MSD1 fragment, as evident from the increased band intensity. PP028 and VX-445 were not effective even if combined with VX-809 (Fig.Â 7A). We then tested the three correctors on MSD1-NBD1 fragment containing the F508del mutation (amino acids: 1â633). Expression of this construct resulted in a single band of the expected molecular size. MSD1-NBD1(âF) was sensitive to VX-809 (Fig.Â 7B), but showed no significant stabilization by PP028 and VX-445, either alone or in combinations. Comparable results were also obtained with the fragment including the R domain, i.e. MSD1-NBD1(âF)-R (amino acids: 1â823) (Fig.Â 7C). Finally, we tested correctors on the MSD1-NBD1(F508del)-R-MSD2 (amino acids: 1â1181; Fig.Â 7D). This construct, which includes most of CFTR domains except for NBD2 and the carboxy-terminus, was responsive to all three correctors. More precisely, PP028 was not effective by itself but significantly increased band intensity in combination with VX-809 compared to VX-809 alone (Fig.Â 7D). VX-445 was effective as a single treatment compared to vehicle and markedly enhanced fragment stability when combined to VX-809.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>26417</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26428</offset><text>The identification of small molecules able to improve the maturation, trafficking, and gating of mutant CFTR is of high relevance to design pharmacological strategies to treat the basic defect in CF. In the present study, we have identified a novel class of correctors. The structure of angular furocumarins and constrained bithiazoles, encouraged the evaluation of several heteroanalogues of an in house library, which was the starting point of our chemical exploration. By screening our focused library, we found PP007 as the only active compound, with the interesting property of showing synergy when combined with VX-809, a typical C1 corrector. Starting from PP007, we generated a series of analogues that led us first to PP008, a close analogue of hit PP007, having improved potency and efficacy on F508del-CFTR as corrector in cell lines and primary airway epithelial cells. Further modifications of the structure of PP008 allowed us to discover PP028, a derivative with a better activity profile than the parent compound. In the presence of VX-809, PP008 and PP028 do not only show enhanced efficacy but also an improvement in potency as indicated by the decrease in the EC50 value. These results suggest that VX-809 and PP compounds cooperate by acting on two different sites of CFTR protein. We combined PP028 with other types of correctors, including 3151, as a C2 corrector, and 4172 and VX-445, as C3 correctors. We found synergy with 3151 but not with 4172 and VX-445. Actually, we found a sort of antagonism between PP028 and 4172, suggesting that the binding of one molecule negatively affects the binding and/or efficacy of the other molecule.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28089</offset><text>The lack of additivity/synergy between PP028, VX-445, and 4172 indicates that all of them belong to the same class of correctors. Previously, VX-445 and 4172 were classified as C3 correctors, with a possible mechanism of action involving binding to NBD1. Therefore, according to our functional data, PP028 should also be a C3 corrector. Recently, VX-809 binding site was identified in MSD1, in agreement with previous studies showing that VX-809 improves the stability of a CFTR fragment that only includes the first six transmembrane helices. We have adopted the stabilization of CFTR fragments of different length as an assay to investigate the mechanism of action of PP028 in comparison with other CFTR correctors. As expected, VX-809 was the only compound that markedly stabilized MSD1. Surprisingly, VX-445 did not stabilize the MSD1-NBD1(âF) fragment, despite previous indications, obtained with other types of assays, that VX-445 binds to NBD1. PP028 was also ineffective on the same fragment, as well as on MSD1-NBD1(âF)-R. Instead, we found a stabilizing effect of PP028 and VX-445 in combination with VX-809, when MSD2 was included in the CFTR construct. VX-445 was also effective in the absence of VX-809. These results could imply that the binding site of C3 correctors is in the second transmembrane domain of CFTR. While finalizing our manuscript, a cryo-EM study was published showing that VX-445 indeed interacts with MSD2, more precisely with amino acid residues (Trp1098, Arg1102) of transmembrane helix 11. Intriguingly, VX-445 does not bind to a well defined pocket inside CFTR but interacts with the surface of transmembrane region. Furthermore, a small portion of VX-445 also interacts with the lasso domain (Ser18, Arg21), which belongs to the CFTR amino-terminus. Therefore, it appears that VX-445 forms a bridge between two distinct CFTR regions, a type of interaction that may be important for protein stabilization. It will be interesting to assess if PP compounds share the same binding site of VX-445.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30124</offset><text>In conclusion, our study has revealed a new family of CFTR correctors, showing a marked efficacy in primary airway epithelial cells from CF patients with F508del mutation. Considering that PP028, the best corrector of this family, was found within a relatively small set of analogues, we can postulate that further exploration of the chemical space around the PP scaffold, also supported by the structural information about the binding site of C3 correctors, may lead to compounds with improved ability to rescue F508del and other CFTR mutants with trafficking defects. This is an important step since the potency and efficacy of PP compounds on mutant CFTR function and trafficking needs to be improved.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30829</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>30851</offset><text>Chemistry</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30861</offset><text>Compounds shown in Fig.Â 2 were prepared according to our previously reported methods.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>30948</offset><text>Cell culture</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30961</offset><text>CFBE41o- cells, co-expressing F508del-CFTR and HS-YFP, and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM/Hamâs F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2Â mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100Â Âµg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM/F12 medium).

The protocol for collection and culture of human bronchial epithelial cells was described in detail in a previous study. Briefly, human bronchi, dissected from the lungs of CF patients undergoing lung transplant, were washed and incubated overnight at 4Â Â°C in protease XIV solution. Epithelial cells were then detached by vigorously pipetting of bronchial lumen, pelleted by centrifugation, and dissociated by 5â10Â min treatment with trypsin. After neutralization of trypsin with complete DMEM/F12 medium, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in a serum-free medium. This medium contained a 1:1 mixture of LHC basal medium and RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) plus hormones, growth factors, and other supplements as indicated previously. Additionally, to promote the proliferation of basal stem cells, the medium was supplemented with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist (DMH-1, 1Â ÂµM; Tocris), transforming growth factor- Î² (TGF- Î²) antagonist (A 83â01, 1Â ÂµM; Tocris), and the rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) inhibitor (Y-27632, 10Â ÂµM; Tocris).

Membranes were then incubated for one hour at room temperature with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Agilent) diluted 1:2000) in TBST plus 5% skimmed-milk.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>42370</offset><text>After CFTR fragment detection, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for GAPDH (for MSD1, MSD1-NBD1(âF)-R, and MSD1-NBD1(âF)-R-MSD2) or beta-actin (for MSD1-NBD1(âF)). For GAPDH, we used the mouse MAB374 clone 65C antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). For beta-actin, we used the mouse A1978 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Both antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 and 1:2000, respectively, in TBST plus 5% skimmed-milk. For GAPDH detection, membranes were previously stripped with the Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at dilution 1:20,000 for beta-actin and 1:50,000 for GAPDH. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence with the SuperSignal West Femto Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were obtained using the Molecular Imager UVITEC Cambridge System and subsequently analysed with Fiji software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). CFTR band intensities were analyzed as regions of interest and normalized against the GAPDH or beta-actin control.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>43436</offset><text>Cytotoxicity assay</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43455</offset><text>CFBE41o- cells were seeded in 96-well plates (PhenoPlate, PerkinElmer) at a density of 20,000 cells per well.
