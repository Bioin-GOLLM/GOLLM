The aim of this study was to analyze the association between the rs7158663 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility through a case-control study and meta-analysis. In a case-control study with 430 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 445 healthy controls, the rs7158663 polymorphism was genotyped by direct sequencing. STATA software was used to calculate the pooled odds ratio and 95  confidence interval in a meta-analysis including 4,649 cancer cases and 5,590 controls. Both the case-control study and meta-analysis showed that the rs7158663 polymorphism was associated with increased susceptibility to CRC. Individuals carrying the AA or GA genotype were more likely to develop CRC than those carrying the rs7158663 GG genotype. Interestingly, MEG3 expression was significantly lower in colorectal tissues of the AA or GA genotype compared to those of the rs7158663 GG genotype. In addition, the meta-analysis suggested that the rs7158663 polymorphism was also associated with increased susceptibility to breast cancer and gastric cancer. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the rs7158663 A allele contributed to the binding of hsa-miR-4307 and hsa-miR-1265 to MEG3. In conclusion, the current findings suggest that the MEG3 gene rs7158663 polymorphism may serve as a genetic marker for predicting the risk of cancers, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer and CRC. However, the sample size of the current study is still insufficient, especially in the subgroup analysis. Therefore large and well-designed studies are needed to validate our findings.</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="NCBI Gene">55384</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="108" length="4"/><text>MEG3</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="NCBI Gene">55384</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="966" length="4"/><text>MEG3</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="NCBI Gene">100423019</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="1350" length="12"/><text>hsa-miR-4307</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="NCBI Gene">100302116</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="1367" length="12"/><text>hsa-miR-1265</text></annotation><annotation id="5"><infon key="NCBI Gene">55384</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="1383" length="4"/><text>MEG3</text></annotation><annotation id="6"><infon key="NCBI Gene">55384</infon><infon key="type">Gene</infon><location offset="1442" length="4"/><text>MEG3</text></annotation></passage></document></collection>
