It is the largest apparatus in the human body, and its function is important for contraction and movements. In addition, it is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation. In fact, inhibition of protein synthesis and/or activation of catabolism determines a pathological condition called muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy is a reduction in muscle mass resulting in a partial or complete loss of function. It has been established that many physiopathological conditions can cause a reduction in muscle mass. Nevertheless, it is not well known the molecular mechanisms and signaling processes causing this dramatic event. There are multiple concomitant processes involved in muscle atrophy. In fact, the gene transcription of some factors, oxidative stress mechanisms, and the alteration of ion transport through specific ion channels may contribute to muscle function impairment. In this review, we focused on the molecular mechanisms responsible for muscle damage and potential drugs to be used to alleviate this disabling condition.</text><annotation id="0"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="255" length="5"/><text>human</text></annotation></passage></document></collection>
