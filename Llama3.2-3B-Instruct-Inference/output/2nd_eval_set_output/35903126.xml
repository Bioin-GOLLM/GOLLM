This study aimed to investigate the association of leukocytosis on admission with an increased risk of acute lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (LEDVT) in elderly patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective observational study of consecutive patients observed with spontaneous ICH aged 60 years or above at Lanzhou University Second Hospital from January 2017 to September 2021. Clinical data and demographic information were collected and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors of acute LEDVT. One-to-one matching was implemented to balance important patient characteristics by the groups' propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Results: A total of 371 elderly patients with primary ICH fulfilled requirements for inclusion and exclusion, of whom 33 (8.89 ) experienced LEDVT. Leukocyte counts were statistically higher in the LEDVT group compared to the non-LEDVT group [12.89 (8.80-14.61) x 109 cells/L vs. 8.31 (6.60-10.75) x 109 cells /L, p  lt; 0.001]. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for several potential confounding factors were performed, and leukocytes were consistently a significant independent predictor of LEDVT. The optimal cut-off value of leukocyte counts calculated from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to predict LEDVT was 10.22 x 109 cells /L (area under the curve:0.714, 95 CI 0.665-0.759; the sensitivity was 72.73 ; the specificity was 71.01 ) in elderly patients with primary ICH. After one-to-one PSM, compared to the matched non-LEDVT group, the matched LEDVT group had significantly higher leukocyte counts [11.98 (8.40-13.94) x 109 cells/L vs. 6.12 (4.68-12.00) x 109 cells/L, p = 0.003]. After PSM, the ROC curve was plotted for leukocytes as a predictor of LEDVT, with an AUC of 0.722 (95 CI 0.593-0.828, p = 0.001; the sensitivity was 87.10 , and the specificity was 61.29 ). Elevated leukocytes remained independently significant as predictors of LEDVT in elderly patients with primary ICH. Conclusion: Leukocyte at admission is an independent risk factor of LEDVT in elderly patients with primary ICH.</text><annotation id="1"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="466" length="8"/><text>patients</text></annotation><annotation id="2"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="604" length="8"/><text>patients</text></annotation><annotation id="3"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="974" length="7"/><text>patient</text></annotation><annotation id="4"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="1087" length="8"/><text>patients</text></annotation><annotation id="5"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="1839" length="8"/><text>patients</text></annotation><annotation id="6"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="2357" length="8"/><text>patients</text></annotation><annotation id="7"><infon key="NCBI Taxonomy">9606</infon><infon key="type">Species</infon><location offset="2469" length="8"/><text>patients</text></annotation></passage></document></collection>
