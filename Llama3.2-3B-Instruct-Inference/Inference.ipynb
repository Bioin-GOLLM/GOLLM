Muscle-specific RING finger protein-1 (MuRF1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase selectively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. This protein is upregulated during skeletal muscle atrophy and is able to control sarcomere muscle protein degradation.', 'Indeed, a decrease in muscle mass may be associated with an upregulation of some ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and some ubiquitin protein ligases (E3). The first muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that were discovered to have a role in muscle loss were Atrogin-1/MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF1). Substrates of MuRF1 are myosin heavy chains, myosin light chains, actin, myosin binding protein C, and troponin I.', 'It has been found that MuRF1 knockout mice are more resistant to muscle atrophy produced by different pathological conditions. Accordingly, the MuRF1 overexpression in mice enhances ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, and causes neuromuscular junction instability and muscle atrophy. However, the absence of MuRF1 does not protect soleus muscle atrophy induced by spaceflight, showing that this model is quite different with respect to other models of atrophy.', 'During atrophy, other E3s are produced in smaller quantities, including Trim32, a ligase important for actin, tropomyosin, and troponins degradation.', 'Muscle-specific TRAF6 knockout mice have low amounts of polyubiquitylated proteins in starving muscles. TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation is essential for the activation of different factors, such as JNK, AMPK, FoxO3, and NFkappaB, which, in turn, are important for atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression (Figure 1).', 'It has been found that NFkappaB activation in skeletal muscle determines muscle degeneration and inhibits regeneration in dystrophic muscles. NF-kappaB can raise the expression of ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins (e.g., MURF1) and/or proinflammatory cytokines, and also chemokines able to contribute to skeletal muscle wasting. In fact, it has been observed that the muscle-specific overexpression of IKKbeta in transgenic mice leads to muscle mass loss mediated by the action of the ubiquitin ligase E3 MuRF1.', 'In support of this, it was found that the specific deletion of IKKbeta in skeletal muscle in mice avoided the expression of the MuRF1 gene and consequently prevented atrophy. Despite the mechanisms still not being fully understood, NF-kB also seems to interfere with the IGF1-Akt signaling pathway.', \"Activation of NF-kappaB increases the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in muscle cells that sequester HuR (RNA-binding protein) by preventing transcription of MyoD. Denervation-induced atrophy is related to the upregulation of specific histone deacetylases (HDAC), able to repress a negative regulator of myogenin, with an increase in MuRF1 expression and muscle wasting. AMPK (protein kinase activated by 5'adenosine monophosphate) is also involved in muscle atrophy.\", 'Nevertheless, this response might turn into an adverse event with boosted muscle catabolism. A decrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and an increase in mRNA encoding for the ubiquitin protein ligases, atrogin, and MuRF1, were found during the earliest days of disuse. Together with muscle atrophy, we found a modification of the percentage of the various isoforms of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) in the soleus muscle.', 'In a preclinical model of cisplatin-induced cachexia, severe atrophy has been found in terms of cross-sectional area (CSA) decrease, and MURF-1 increased expression associated with a significant increase in resting intracellular calcium and functional modifications. Indeed, a decrease in membrane ionic conductances with an increase in sarcolemma excitability was found in EDL muscle.', 'Glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy relies on an increase in protein catabolism and reduced protein synthesis. The action of glucocorticoids on protein degradation is mediated by atrogenes such as FOXO, Atrogin-1, and MuRF-1. In particular, the myosin heavy chain contractile proteins are the most affected.', 'KLEF15 is a transcription factor involved in several metabolic processes in skeletal muscle, for example, in the upregulation of branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2), which, in turn, induces the degradation of branched-chain amino acids. Furthermore, KLF15 contributes to muscle catabolism through the transcriptional regulation of FoxO1, atrogin-1, and MuRF1 (Figure 3). ', 'For example, the inhibition of some specific muscle proteins such as MAFbx or Foxo, ATF4, Gadd45a, p21, and MEKK4 transcription factors can avoid the loss of muscle mass without leading to a hypertrophic condition. Among the different ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1 and TRAF6 have been studied for the development of muscle-specific inhibitors. However, the removal of MuRF1 or TRAF6 only partially preserves muscle atrophy during denervation in mice.', 'As an example, MG132 proteasome inhibitor can prevent muscle atrophy associated with muscle disuse.', 'Ghrelin null mice (Ghrl -/-) are more prone to fasting-induced muscle atrophy, particularly in the Gas muscle. In these mice, there is also a reduced expression of the myogenic regulator MyoD and a higher expression of the protein degradation marker MuRF1.', 'Therefore, the administration of protein supplements or compounds able to stimulate protein synthesis could be useful in the prevention of atrophy. For instance, ursolic acid stimulates muscle hypertrophy and reduces the expression of MuRF-1 in soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of chronic kidney disease mice. It also reduced myostatin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) in dexamethasone-treated C2C12 cell lines.', 'D-methionine, another essential amino acid found in some aliments such as yogurt, cheese, meat, and eggs, increases soleus and gastrocnemius muscle weight in the cisplatin-induced rat muscle atrophy model. The action of D-methionine is due to the downregulation of MAFbx and MuRF1 and to the upregulation of myogenin and MyoD.', 'In fact, it preserved resting gCl and resting cytosolic calcium concentration (restCa), corrected permeability of the calcium membrane through the sarcolemma cation channels, and improved the phenotypic transition induced by HU. In addition, taurine restored the expression of MURF-1, suggesting an early protective effect of this amino acid in the attenuation of the atrophic process. Some studies have shown that in C2C12 myotubes, taurine avoids muscle atrophy induced by cisplatin by restoring microtubular and mitochondrial function and reducing the overload and localization of autophagolysosomes.', 'The production of free radicals consequently determines an increase in protein catabolism. For example, vitamin C deficiency has been shown to cause muscle atrophy in mice, associated with high expression of MAFbx and MuRF1 and hyperproduction of ROS. Vitamin E has been described as an antioxidant able to prevent hindlimb immobilization-induced muscle atrophy in rats.', 'Identification of the MuRF1 Skeletal Muscle Ubiquitylome Through Quantitative Proteomics', 'Skeletal muscle in MuRF1 null mice is not spared in low-gravity conditions, indicating atrophy proceeds by unique mechanisms in space']\n",

The knockdown of UBR5 was found to be associated with reductions in ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, reduction in the level of eIF4e, which is involved in translation initiation, and consequent impairment of protein synthesis.', 'In support of this, it was found that the specific deletion of IKKbeta in skeletal muscle in mice avoided the expression of the MuRF1 gene and consequently prevented atrophy. Despite the mechanisms still not being fully understood, NF-kB also seems to interfere with the IGF1-Akt signaling pathway. Indeed, it has been noted that conditional IKKbeta knockout mice are resistant to muscle atrophy but demonstrate Akt hyper-phosphorylation.', 'Activation of NF-kB can also generate muscle atrophy by opposing myogenic differentiation.', 'Among the different isoforms of IGF1, IGF-1Ea is the one capable of increasing strength and muscle mass. Insulin and IGF1 have been shown to activate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways, fundamental in hypertrophy (Figure 4).

The glucocorticoid receptor promotes the expression of two genes, codifying for REDD1 and KLF15.', 'REDD1 inhibits the activity of mTOR. Inhibition of mTOR activates KLF15, promoting atrophy. KLEF15 is a transcription factor involved in several metabolic processes in skeletal muscle, for example, in the upregulation of branched-chain aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2), which, in turn, induces the degradation of branched-chain amino acids.', 'Insulin/IGF1 signaling interferes with the mTOR kinase, which, in turn, cooperates with different proteins to form two different complexes: the rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 complex, which includes Raptor, and the rapamycin-insensitive TORC2 complex, which includes Rictor. While the Rictor knockout mice in the muscle do not exhibit an evident phenotype, Raptor and mTOR-deficient mice show decreased growth of fast but not of slow muscle fibers. In addition, overexpression of IGF-1 has been shown to have limited effects in preventing HU-induced muscle atrophy since, after HU, slow or fast muscles are no longer responsive to the hypertrophic action of IGF-1.', 'These drugs promote protein synthesis and inhibit its degradation.

            "- In particular, atrogenes are thought to be important for protein loss. Muscle-specific RING finger protein-1 (MuRF1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase selectively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. This protein is upregulated during skeletal muscle atrophy and is able to control sarcomere muscle protein degradation.\n",
            "- Indeed, a decrease in muscle mass may be associated with an upregulation of some ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and some ubiquitin protein ligases (E3). The first muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that were discovered to have a role in muscle loss were Atrogin-1/MAFbx and muscle ring finger-1 (MuRF1). Substrates of MuRF1 are myosin heavy chains, myosin light chains, actin, myosin binding protein C, and troponin I.\n",
            "- It has been found that MuRF1 knockout mice are more resistant to muscle atrophy produced by different pathological conditions. Accordingly, the MuRF1 overexpression in mice enhances ubiquitination of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins, and causes neuromuscular junction instability and muscle atrophy. However, the absence of MuRF1 does not protect soleus muscle atrophy induced by spaceflight, showing that this model is quite different with respect to other models of atrophy.\n",
            "- During atrophy, other E3s are produced in smaller quantities, including Trim32, a ligase important for actin, tropomyosin, and troponins degradation.\n",
            "- Muscle-specific TRAF6 knockout mice have low amounts of polyubiquitylated proteins in starving muscles. TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation is essential for the activation of different factors, such as JNK, AMPK, FoxO3, and NFkappaB, which, in turn, are important for atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression (Figure 1).\n",
            "- It has been found that NFkappaB activation in skeletal muscle determines muscle degeneration and inhibits regeneration in dystrophic muscles. NF-kappaB can raise the expression of ubiquitin-proteasome system proteins (e.g., MURF1) and/or proinflammatory cytokines, and also chemokines able to contribute to skeletal muscle wasting. In fact, it has been observed that the muscle-specific overexpression of IKKbeta in transgenic mice leads to muscle mass loss mediated by the action of the ubiquitin ligase E3 MuRF1.\n",
            "- In support of this, it was found that the specific deletion of IKKbeta in skeletal muscle in mice avoided the expression of the MuRF1 gene and consequently prevented atrophy. Despite the mechanisms still not being fully understood, NF-kB also seems to interfere with the IGF1-Akt signaling pathway.\n",
            "- Activation of NF-kappaB increases the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in muscle cells that sequester HuR (RNA-binding protein) by preventing transcription of MyoD. Denervation-induced atrophy is related to the upregulation of specific histone deacetylases (HDAC), able to repress a negative regulator of myogenin, with an increase in MuRF1 expression and muscle wasting. AMPK (protein kinase activated by 5'adenosine monophosphate) is also involved in muscle atrophy.\n",
