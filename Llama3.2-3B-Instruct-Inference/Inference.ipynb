To do this, we tested two mutations with matching disruption profiles on the protein PSPH (Fig. 5a): (i) T152I, a rare variant (MAF = 0.10%) in ExAC that disrupts an interaction with itself and (ii) D32N, a disease-associated mutation that also disrupts an interaction with itself and causes phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency in a compound heterozygous individual with two deleterious PSPH mutations.', 'An additional PSPH non-disruptive rare variant, T149M, was included as a control. Since PSPH exists as a dimer in solution and can aggregate when mutations that interfere with dimerization are introduced, we reasoned that mutations that disrupt this dimerization may also reduce PSPH enzymatic activity. We therefore purified recombinant WT, D32N, T152I, and T149M PSPH proteins and measured for changes in phosphatase activity for PSPH mutants relative to WT using a malachite green assay.', 'Our in vitro assays revealed that T152I significantly reduced PSPH phosphatase activity to 59.2% +- 4.3% relative to WT (SEM; P = 0.0010 by one-tailed t-test; n = 3), which nearly matched the D32N reduction in activity (60.0% +- 3.3%, P = 6.6 x 10-4 by one-tailed t-test compared to WT; n = 3).

Both mutations perturbed interactions with SEPT7 and SEPT2 subgroup proteins, SEPT1 and SEPT5 (Fig. 5c).', 'These perturbations are particularly relevant because SEPT12 is known to interact with other septin proteins found in the SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7 protein subgroups to form a filamentous structure at the sperm annulus. Moreover, the infertility-causing mutation SEPT12_D197N has been previously shown to perturb interactions with these same septin subgroup proteins, resulting in a disorganized sperm annulus and poor sperm motility in a mouse model for D197N. Lastly, using homology modeling, we observed that both G169E and D197N mutations occur at SEPT12 interaction interface residues with SEPT1 (Fig.', '5d) and confirmed that both mutations disrupt the SEPT12-SEPT1 interaction without reducing protein stability in 293T cells (Fig. 5e). These results demonstrate that these mutations function by specifically perturbing SEPT12 protein-protein interactions, as opposed to disrupting SEPT12 stability as a whole.', '5g), a phenotype also reported for Sept12D197N male mice. Our observations of poor sperm motility and subfertility in homozygous Sept12G169E male mice suggest that SEPT12_G169E may deleteriously impact fertility in men homozygous for this mutation, although we note that no individuals homozygous for SEPT12_G169E have been reported in ExAC. Taken together with our in vitro data, these results also demonstrate how shared disruption profiles can be used to prioritize candidate disease-associated mutations.', 'SEPT12 mutations cause male infertility with defective sperm annulus', 'SEPT12 orchestrates the formation of mammalian sperm annulus by organizing core octameric complexes with other SEPT proteins']\n",

To do this, we tested two mutations with matching disruption profiles on the protein PSPH (Fig. 5a): (i) T152I, a rare variant (MAF = 0.10%) in ExAC that disrupts an interaction with itself and (ii) D32N, a disease-associated mutation that also disrupts an interaction with itself and causes phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency in a compound heterozygous individual with two deleterious PSPH mutations.\n",

Since PSPH exists as a dimer in solution and can aggregate when mutations that interfere with dimerization are introduced, we reasoned that mutations that disrupt this dimerization may also reduce PSPH enzymatic activity. We therefore purified recombinant WT, D32N, T152I, and T149M PSPH proteins and measured for changes in phosphatase activity for PSPH mutants relative to WT using a malachite green assay.\n",
