Luciferase assay showed that miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p targeted two different sites in 3'-UTR of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 receptor 3 (TGFBR3) respectively. Consistently, TGFBR3 siRNA could increase fibrosis-related genes expression, along with the Smad1 inactivation and Smad3 activation in HAFs.\", 'Additionally, overexpression of TGFBR3 could alleviate the increase of COL1A1, COL3A1 and ACTA2 in HAFs after transfection with miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p respectively. Moreover, Smad3 was activated in HAFs in response to Ang-II treatment and inactivation of Smad3 attenuated up-regulation of miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p in Ang-II-treated HAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that the clustered miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p consistently promote atrial fibrosis by targeting TGFBR3 to activate Smad3 signalling in HAFs, suggesting that miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p are potential therapeutic targets for atrial fibrosis.', 'In light of its essential role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, TGF-beta has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target.22 TGF-beta1 receptor 3(TGFBR3) is negatively regulated by TGF-beta1 in multiple cell types and mediates TGF-beta superfamily ligand-dependent as well as ligand-independent signalling to both Smad and non-Smad signalling pathways.23 A recent study showed that TGFBR3 inhibited TGF-beta1 expression, Smad2/3 activation and TGFBR1-TGFBR2 complex formation and collagen production in cardiac fibroblasts.24 However, it still not known whether TGFBR3 can be modulated by miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p in atrial fibroblasts.', 'In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p in atrial appendages of patients with rheumatic AF and in HAFs treated with Ang-II. Based on bio-informatic analysis, we speculated that TGFBR3 is a target of miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p and further validated their interactions in this study.
