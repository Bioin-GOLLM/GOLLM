In agreement with this paradigm, large-scale whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing efforts have reported an excess of genetic variation in human genomes segregating at very low allele frequencies. In particular, rare coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have been predicted to disproportionately impact protein function in human genomes; however, methods and metrics for estimating the functionality of coding SNVs vary widely, and there is no consensus estimate for the number of functional variants per individual. As such, a direct assessment of the functional impact of coding SNVs could prove indispensable to furthering our understanding on how segregating genetic variation influences complex traits and human disease.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2494</offset><text>Biological processes are likely regulated through intricate networks of protein and macromolecular interactions, as opposed to single proteins acting independently. Researchers have accordingly identified a large number of mutations that disrupt these interactions; however, most of these perturbations correspond to synthetic mutations from scanning mutagenesis experiments, the vast majority of which do not occur naturally in human populations. For example, the SKEMPI database comprehensively collected the impact of 3047 mutations on protein-binding events published in the literature, only seven of which are listed as human population variants in ExAC. Efforts to examine the impact of disease-associated mutations on protein function are also limited because most of these mutations are very rare and consequently only impact a small number of individuals. The evolutionary context in which all genomic variants evolve is largely missing from such studies as a result.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3471</offset><text>In order to acquire a more representative understanding of the functional impact of human population variants on protein function, we leveraged the ExAC dataset of coding variants from 60,706 human exomes to systematically evaluate the impact of 2009 missense SNVs, 811 of which are segregating at minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.1% in human populations, across 2185 protein-protein interactions. We find that disruptive SNVs are strongly enriched at conserved protein loci and occur more prevalently at lower allele frequencies, underscoring the functional importance of disruptive variants uncovered by our assays. Moreover, we also determine that on average 10.5% of coding SNVs carried per individual are expected to impact protein-protein interactions, a rate much higher than indicated by previous reports. Unexpectedly, while we observe an enrichment of functional SNVs at rare allele frequencies in agreement with previous literature, we also find that 9.6% of tested common variants with MAF &gt; 10% perturbed protein interactions, indicating that many common variants are also functional. Finally, we show how candidate disease-associated mutations can be identified through matching interaction perturbation profiles with known disease-causing mutations. In this manner, we characterize a rare variant on the enzyme PSPH that significantly reduces its catalytic activity, as well as a rare variant on SEPT12 that results in male subfertility in CRISPR-edited mice, demonstrating the functional relevance of the interaction-disruptive SNVs reported here.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5047</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5055</offset><text>Disruptive SNVs occur extensively across broad MAF ranges</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41467_2019_11959_Fig1_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>5113</offset><text>A pipeline for surveying the impact of 2009 SNVs on protein-protein interactions. a Phenotypic consequences of coding variants in human genotypes can be interpreted as products of protein-protein interaction perturbations in the interactome. b Over half of all unique missense variants in ExAC are singletons.

As such, coding variation at interaction interfaces is mostly rare and subject to evolutionary constraint. In contrast, common variation is expected to be largely neutral and therefore unlikely to be extensively functional. Nonetheless, notable exceptions exist, including APOE-epsilon 4, a risk-associated allele for Alzheimer's disease (MAF = 18.4%), and the P12A polymorphism (MAF = 11.0%) of PPARG, which increases risk for type 2 diabetes. Indeed, the extent to which MAF indicates whether an allele is disruptive to protein interactions remains largely unexplored. Hence, to systematically identify functionally relevant SNVs across rare to common allele frequencies, we constructed a resource of sequence-verified, single-colony clones for 2009 SNVs derived from three major databases: 1676 variants from ExAC, 204 Mendelian disease-associated mutations from HGMD, and 162 somatic mutations in cancer from COSMIC. To avoid oversampling rare variants which dominate ExAC, we randomly selected alleles in ExAC across defined MAF bins ranging from singletons to very common alleles (Fig. 1b; see the section &quot;Methods&quot;).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41467_2019_11959_Fig2_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>7105</offset><text>Assessing the impact of disruptive alleles on protein function. a Fraction of protein pairs recovered by PCA for disrupted and intact interactions in comparison to positive and random reference sets (PRS and RRS).

In this manner, we identified 442 interaction-disrupting SNVs, including 298 disruptive ExAC variants, comprising a network of 4797 SNV-interaction pairs (Fig. 1c). We further validated the quality of our SNV-interaction network by performing Protein Complementation Assay (PCA) in human 293T cells to retest a representative subset of ~400 disrupted and non-disrupted SNV-interactions pairs from our ExAC subset. SNV-disrupted interactions retested at a rate approximate to a negative reference set comprising randomly selected ORF pairs whereas non-disrupted interactions retested at a rate statistically indistinguishable from a positive reference set of literature-established protein interactions (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1a). Our result remained unchanged when we removed interactions corresponding to highly disruptive SNVs (Supplementary Fig. 1b).

We found that the fraction of disruptive variants decreased inversely with increasing allele frequency (P = 0.0054 by chi-square test, Fig. 2b), which agrees with expectations; however, we note that 9.6% of very common variants (MAF &gt; 10%) were still disruptive. Considering that the majority of SNVs found in an individual genome are common, this elevated proportion may indicate that disruptive coding variation is markedly widespread across populations. To investigate this more closely, we weighted these MAF-stratified disruption rates by their expected proportions within a typical human genome using the site frequency spectrum for missense variants in ExAC (Supplementary Note 2; see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). In this manner, we determined that given an average of 13,595 missense variants per genome, 1434 (10.5% +- 1.8%; SEM) are expected to disrupt protein interactions, a figure notably higher than indicated by previous estimates (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Tables 1-3). We note, however, that the extent to which interaction disruptions result in cellular phenotypes, particularly for common variants, remains undetermined. Regardless, our results demonstrate that many variants show some degree of functionality, at least within the context of our interaction assays; as such, the genetic background in each individual genome might be far more complex than expected.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11499</offset><text>To add further context to our disruption rate analysis, we also determined the fraction of cancer-associated somatic mutations that disrupt interactions and found that 34.8% of somatic mutations located in genes with established roles in cancer progression were disruptive (Fig. 2b; see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). Notably, this fraction decreased significantly to 22.1% for somatic mutations located in all other genes (P = 0.036 by one-tailed Z-test), a figure comparable to the 20.0% disruption rate observed for very rare (MAF &lt;= 0.1%) ExAC alleles. In contrast, 52.9% of tested HGMD disease-associated mutations were disruptive (Fig. 2b). Collectively, these trends in disruption rate suggest that driver mutations in oncogenesis may often function by perturbing interactions, as is the case for disease-associated mutations. Therefore, prioritizing disruptive somatic mutations through our interaction perturbation approach may be an effective means to identify potential driver genes and mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12514</offset><text>The extent to which a mutation is disruptive can also be categorized by measuring the fraction of corresponding protein interactions disrupted by a particular variant. Accordingly, we first grouped each of our 298 disruptive variants by the number of interactions they perturb (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We observed that 205 of our tested SNVs disrupted only a single interaction (68.8%), while a small fraction of variants (6.7%) disrupted five or more interactions, suggesting that disruptive mutations tend to perturb specific subsets of protein function as opposed to perturbing protein function as a whole. Examining the distribution of disruptive variants across the number of interactions perturbed revealed a similar trend (Supplementary Fig. 1d).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13268</offset><text>Next, for proteins tested against multiple interaction partners, ExAC variants that leave all interactions intact were categorized as non-disruptive, variants that disrupt a subset of interaction partners were categorized as partially disruptive, and variants that disrupt all tested protein interactions were categorized as null-like (Fig. 2d). Across these three categories, the median allele frequency for tested variants in ExAC decreased significantly from 0.21% for non-disruptive variants to 0.085% for partially disruptive variants (P = 0.0067 by one-tailed U-test) then nominally to 0.034% for null-like variants (Fig. 2e), suggesting that partially disruptive and null-like variants are potentially deleterious. Furthermore, we also find that Grantham scores, a biochemical measure quantifying the dissimilarity between amino acid residues, for partially disruptive and null-like variants are significantly higher in comparison to non-disruptive variants (Fig. 2f). Moreover, conservation-based functional prediction algorithms, including PolyPhen-2 and MutPred2, show significant increases in the likelihood that a variant is deleterious across non-disruptive, partially disruptive, and null-like disruption categories (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Fig. 1e). Taken together, these results show that disruptive variants follow expected patterns of selective constraint and conservation that are characteristic of damaging mutations and imply that these disruptive variants may be functionally relevant in cells.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14788</offset><text>Missense variants seldom result in unstable protein expression</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41467_2019_11959_Fig3_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>14851</offset><text>Disruptive population variants seldom result in unstable protein expression. a Western blots for representative wild-type:variant pairs across three stability categories detected using alpha-GFP. alpha-GAPDH was used as a loading control. b DUAL-FLOU protein stability scores for 278 wild-type:variant pairs.

To distinguish between these two distinct mechanisms, we developed a dual fluorescence screening assay to survey the impact of interaction-disruptive variants on protein folding. To set up our dual fluorescent screen, we cloned a subset of wild-type (WT) ORFs that are stably expressed when tagged with GFP, as well as their corresponding ExAC variant clones, into a custom GFP-tagged expression vector that co-expresses an untagged mCherry control (see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). We then transfected WT and mutant ORFs into 293T cells to test for mutation-induced changes to protein expression in 96-well plate formats (Fig. 1c). GFP expression levels for transfected WT and mutant samples, normalized with respect to mCherry expression levels, were then used to calculate stability scores for all WT and mutant proteins (Supplementary Note 3). We then grouped variants across stable, moderately stable, and unstable protein expression categories using these stability scores (see the &quot;Methods&quot; section), noting that our three demarcations corresponded well with western blot intensity (Fig. 3a).

While destabilized protein expression certainly influences protein interaction perturbations, we found only seven cases (7%) in which an interaction-disruptive variant resulted in unstable mutant protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 2b). As such, we conclude that most disruptive variants function by inducing local structural perturbations that disrupt specific protein interactions as opposed to destabilizing protein stability as a whole, which agrees with previous studies on disease-associated mutations.

AKR7A2 is an NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase that catalyzes the reduction of succinic semialdehyde (SSA) to gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), an important reaction in the degradation pathway for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Since AKR7A2 is a dimer in solution and A142T disrupts an AKR7A2 interaction with itself, we hypothesized that this mutation might also impact AKR7A2 enzymatic activity. As such, we purified recombinant WT and mutant AKR7A2 protein to test for changes in NADPH-dependent turnover of SSA (see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). Accordingly, we found that kcat/KM decreased from 1.8 x 107 min-1 M-1 for WT protein to 1.0 x 107 min-1 M-1 for AKR7A2_A142T (P = 0.035 by one-tailed t-test, Fig. 3f). In addition to impacting SSA turnover, the A142T mutation is reported to significantly decrease the in vitro metabolism of both doxorubicin and daunorubicin by AKR7A2, which could have important implications in cancer therapy. Moreover, missense mutations that impair ABAT and SSADH activity, enzymes immediately upstream of AKR7A2 (Supplementary Fig. 2c), can result in severe human neurological disorders. Hence, we postulate that AKR7A2_A142T may indeed be functionally relevant in genetic backgrounds with lowered ABAT or SSADH activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>21285</offset><text>Disruptive variants are widespread in disease-relevant genes</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41467_2019_11959_Fig4_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>21346</offset><text>Disruptive variants occur in important gene groups and at conserved genomic sites. a Fraction of disruptive variants that occur in non-constrained (n = 1349), disease-associated (n = 423), cancer-associated (n = 78), essential (n = 223), or LoF-intolerant genes (n = 270). b Fraction of interactions disrupted by variants that occur on interface residues or interface domains (n = 307) in comparison to interactions disrupted by variants that occur away from interaction interfaces (n = 41). c Distribution of Jensen-Shannon Divergence scores for amino acid residues at sites corresponding to disruptive and non-disruptive variants.

We observed comparable enrichment for disruptive variants across disease-associated, cancer-associated, and essential gene sets (Fig. 4a; see the &quot;Methods&quot; section); this enrichment was also comparable to the fraction of disruptive variants found across all genes tested in our SNV-interaction network, excluding highly constrained LoF-intolerant genes (pLI &gt;= 0.9), which were significantly depleted for disruptive variants in comparison to other gene sets (Fig. 4a). LoF-intolerant genes correspond well with haploinsufficient genes in which a single mutant copy of a gene is enough to be deleterious. Such genes would be highly sensitive to disruptive variants as a result, potentially explaining the lower fraction of disruptive variants observed in such genes. Notably, duplicate or functionally similar genes can compensate for corresponding proteins impacted by a disruptive mutation. However, we found no enrichment for disruptive variants within a published set of duplicate genes in comparison to non-disruptive variants (Supplementary Fig. 3a), nor within a custom-generated set of sequence-conserved, functionally similar proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3b; see the &quot;Methods&quot; section).

Similar to disease-associated mutations, we found that variants located at the interaction interface disrupted interactions significantly more often than variants located away from the interface (19.2% and 5.0%, respectively; P = 3.9 x 10-5 by one-tailed Z-test, Fig. 4b; see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). Protein sites corresponding to disruptive variants were also found to be substantially more conserved than those for non-disruptive variants (P = 1.2 x 10-10 by one-tailed U-test, Fig. 4c). Purifying selection may also be more specific to disruptive variants at conserved protein sites than non-disruptive variants at equally conserved sites. To demonstrate this, we binned disruptive and non-disruptive variants by their corresponding Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) scores, an amino acid-based metric for conservation, and then compared their mean allele frequency per JSD scoring bin (see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). We found that while allele frequencies for both disruptive and non-disruptive variants were somewhat comparable at low JSD conservation scores, allele frequency for disruptive variants strongly decreased across increasingly stringent JSD cutoffs in comparison to non-disruptive variants (Supplementary Fig. 4a). A similar pattern was also observed using a genomic:as opposed to an amino acid-based:measure for conservation, phyloP (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Therefore, in addition to frequently occurring in disease-relevant genes, disruptive variants are also more likely to occur at functionally important sites in these genes, further implying that a significant fraction of these disruptive variants may be phenotypically relevant.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26389</offset><text>To complement our exploration of the relationship between conservation and disruptive variation, we also investigated whether disruptive variants tend to occur at genomic regions under positive selection. We applied a test for positive selection based on the distribution of allele frequency around a variant using whole-genome sequencing data from Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project (see the &quot;Methods&quot; section). We observed that genomic regions with disruptive variants exhibit a significant signature of positive selection more often than those with non-disruptive variants. This is the case both within 1000 Genomes continental population groups and globally (Fig. 4d). This result may point to the functional importance of some of the disruptive variants identified here. Therefore, this result also facilitates molecular interpretation of positive selection signals, both in terms of interaction perturbations and by investigating the functions of interacting proteins lost and gained in the presence of these disruptive variants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>27430</offset><text>Identifying phenotypic SNVs via matching disruption profiles</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27491</offset><text>Previous studies have shown that disease-associated mutations often function by perturbing specific protein-protein interactions.

We found that pairs of disease-associated mutations that share at least one or more disrupted interactions resulted in the same disease significantly more often than mutations that did not share any disrupted interactions (0.738 to 0.630, respectively; P = 8.5 x 10-4 by one-tailed Z-test, Fig. 4e).

Two mutations on SMAD4, E330K, and G352R, are associated with juvenile polyposis, while a third mutation, N13S, results in a clinically distinct disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension. We observed that E330K and G352R cluster together in three-dimensional space near the SMAD4-SMAD3 interaction interface (Fig. 4g). N13S, in contrast, appears positioned away from E330K and G352R near the N-terminus of SMAD4. In agreement with the proximal clustering of E330K and G352R near the SMAD4-SMAD3 interaction interface, both mutations disrupted the SMAD4 interaction with SMAD3 in addition to disrupting the SMAD4-SMAD9 interaction (Fig. 4f). These SMAD protein disruption results agree with previous evidence implicating the TGFbeta/SMAD signaling pathway in the formation of juvenile polyposis. In contrast, the N13S mutation left SMAD4 interactions with SMAD3 and SMAD9 intact, which agrees with a previous study that found no evidence that N13S alters SMAD-mediated signaling.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">41467_2019_11959_Fig5_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig5</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>29911</offset><text>Prioritizing candidate disease-associated mutations through shared disruption profiles. a Schematic of interaction disruption profiles for disease-associated mutation D32N and rare variants T152I and T149M.

To do this, we tested two mutations with matching disruption profiles on the protein PSPH (Fig. 5a): (i) T152I, a rare variant (MAF = 0.10%) in ExAC that disrupts an interaction with itself and (ii) D32N, a disease-associated mutation that also disrupts an interaction with itself and causes phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency in a compound heterozygous individual with two deleterious PSPH mutations. An additional PSPH non-disruptive rare variant, T149M, was included as a control. Since PSPH exists as a dimer in solution and can aggregate when mutations that interfere with dimerization are introduced, we reasoned that mutations that disrupt this dimerization may also reduce PSPH enzymatic activity. We therefore purified recombinant WT, D32N, T152I, and T149M PSPH proteins and measured for changes in phosphatase activity for PSPH mutants relative to WT using a malachite green assay. Our in vitro assays revealed that T152I significantly reduced PSPH phosphatase activity to 59.2% +- 4.3% relative to WT (SEM; P = 0.0010 by one-tailed t-test; n = 3), which nearly matched the D32N reduction in activity (60.0% +- 3.3%, P = 6.6 x 10-4 by one-tailed t-test compared to WT; n = 3). In contrast, T149M showed no significant change in enzymatic activity relative to WT (P = 0.19 by one-tailed t-test, Fig. 5b). Because phosphoserine phosphatase deficiency is a recessively inherited condition, our findings suggest that T152I may lead to the same disease phenotype in homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33679</offset><text>To further demonstrate how potential physiologically relevant mutations can be identified using shared disruption profiles, we also characterized a pair of disruptive mutations on the GTPase, SEPT12: G169E (MAF = 0.02%), a rare variant not known to associate with any disease phenotypes, and D197N, an infertility-causing mutation in men. Both mutations perturbed interactions with SEPT7 and SEPT2 subgroup proteins, SEPT1 and SEPT5 (Fig. 5c). These perturbations are particularly relevant because SEPT12 is known to interact with other septin proteins found in the SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7 protein subgroups to form a filamentous structure at the sperm annulus. Moreover, the infertility-causing mutation SEPT12_D197N has been previously shown to perturb interactions with these same septin subgroup proteins, resulting in a disorganized sperm annulus and poor sperm motility in a mouse model for D197N. Lastly, using homology modeling, we observed that both G169E and D197N mutations occur at SEPT12 interaction interface residues with SEPT1 (Fig. 5d) and confirmed that both mutations disrupt the SEPT12-SEPT1 interaction without reducing protein stability in 293T cells (Fig. 5e). These results demonstrate that these mutations function by specifically perturbing SEPT12 protein-protein interactions, as opposed to disrupting SEPT12 stability as a whole.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35045</offset><text>We then investigated whether these matching SEPT12 molecular phenotypes result in corresponding organismal phenotypes by generating Sept12G169E mice using a CRISPR-editing approach.

Notably, sperm from homozygous Sept12G169E males exhibited poor motility (Fig. 5g), a phenotype also reported for Sept12D197N male mice. Our observations of poor sperm motility and subfertility in homozygous Sept12G169E male mice suggest that SEPT12_G169E may deleteriously impact fertility in men homozygous for this mutation, although we note that no individuals homozygous for SEPT12_G169E have been reported in ExAC. Taken together with our in vitro data, these results also demonstrate how shared disruption profiles can be used to prioritize candidate disease-associated mutations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>35911</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35922</offset><text>Disentangling the phenotypic impact of functional missense mutations from benign mutations has proven to be uniquely challenging. Conventions for determining which missense mutations are functional vary widely, as do their genome-wide estimates for the number of functional coding mutations per individual (Fig. 2c). These inconsistencies are problematic, since accurate measurements of the impact of SNVs on protein functions are essential for generating concrete hypotheses about disease etiology based on molecular mechanisms. Therefore, in the absence of a consensus metric for assessing the functional impact of missense mutations across a large set of proteins, we directly measured the impact of 1676 missense ExAC-listed population variants (811 with MAF &gt; 0.1%) across 4109 protein-variant interaction pairs and identified 298 disruptive variants affecting 669 human protein interactions. In this manner, we have constructed an unbiased resource to examine the relationships between the population, genetic, and evolutionary characteristics of SNVs and their functional impacts genome-wide.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>37026</offset><text>By weighting our measured disruption rates against their expected proportions per individual genome, we further determined that 10.5% of missense variants per individual are expected to be disruptive. It should be noted that, like any high-throughput assay, Y2H cannot detect all interactions for a given protein. If we were able to detect more interactions, we would likely discover more interaction disruptions. Therefore, this 10.5% figure represents only a lower-bound estimate for the number of disruptive missense variants per individual. Furthermore, considering that interaction perturbations are just one way in which mutations can perturb protein function, genome-wide surveys for other types of activities (e.g., enzymatic activities, transcription factors binding to DNA, etc.) may reveal that functional variants, at least at the molecular-level, are even more widespread than suggested here. Finally, we note that literature-curated sources are not appropriate for reproducing the analyses presented here because of their strong biases to synthetic and very rare mutations. Even literature-curated mutations listed at appreciable allele frequencies may be inappropriate, since such mutations are often selected because of their known disease associations. For example, a recent study comprehensively collected the impact of 7955 mutations on human protein interactions published in the literature; however, only 161 of these mutations were without disease annotations and listed in ExAC, of which 49 occurred at appreciable frequencies (MAF &gt; 0.1%).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38594</offset><text>The genetic and genomic context in which a variant occurs is crucial for properly interpreting the functional impact that a disruptive mutation may have. While haplosufficiency likely mitigates the impact of numerous disruptive variants, an individual already harboring one disruptive variant can become sensitized to the consequences of subsequent mutations in the same gene or pathway. For example, we identified a null-like, common variant, A142T, on the protein AKR7A2 that significantly reduces its enzymatic activity relative to WT (Fig. 3g). This mutation alone likely has a minimal impact on fitness; however, mutations to enzymes immediately upstream to AKR7A2, particularly ABAT and SSADH (Supplementary Fig. 2b), can result in severe neurological disorders. Co-occurrence of AKR7A2_A142T with similarly disruptive mutations in ABAT or SSADH could therefore result in a neurological disorder that would not otherwise occur in an individual harboring only a single disruptive mutation. Such relationships are frequent in complex disease, including cancer and heart disease, which unlike Mendelian mutations, require multiple mutations on more than one gene to cause a disorder. Each disease-associated mutation in complex disease therefore contributes a certain measure of disease risk that can be quantified by a GWAS, and some authors consider these effects to be approximately additive across loci. Measuring how one mutation modulates the impact of another is challenging; however, measuring which mutations are individually functional is a crucial first step. Hence, we anticipate that our SNV-interaction network will serve as a pivotal framework for defining the epistatic relationships that modulate the impact of disruptive variants, particularly for partially penetrant variants that only result in disease in certain genetic backgrounds (Supplementary Note 4).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40476</offset><text>Several methods to experimentally measure the impact of coding mutations at large scales have been recently reported. The depth of proteins, variants, and interactions presented here complements these previous methods well. For example, Fields and Shendure developed a massively parallel single-amino-acid mutagenesis pipeline, named PALS, that can generate nearly all potential singleton mutations possible for a particular gene of interest. This impressive depth makes PALS an excellent method for studying extensive variation in a single protein, most notably TP53 and BRCA1, but remains to be optimized for studying variation across a large set of unique genes. In contrast, our mutagenesis approach allowed us to survey &gt; 2000 mutations across 847 unique genes. Similarly, while Y2H is widely used for characterizing the impact of mutations on protein-protein interactions, several derivatives for detecting perturbations by Y2H exist. For instance, Stelzl and colleagues developed the Int-Seq platform for probing protein-protein interaction disruptions using a Reverse Two-Hybrid (R2H) approach. While this R2H approach increases assay sensitivity, a R2H reference interactome is not yet available, limiting the coverage of this approach to a handful of interactions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41759</offset><text>Interaction perturbations constitute only a particular subset of the variety of ways in which mutations can impair protein function.

Valid representative ORFs had to be identical within a 31 amino acid window centered on the position of interest for mutagenesis.

If mutant protein expression dropped below plate reader detection thresholds, as indicated by a mutant stability score &lt; 0, we instead categorized the mutant protein as unstable. Mutant proteins above both thresholds are scored as stable (Supplementary Note 3). Stability data for tested ExAC variants are reported in Supplementary Data 5.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>55737</offset><text>Retesting disrupted and non-disrupted interactions by PCA</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>55795</offset><text>To confirm that variant-disrupted protein-protein interactions are reproducible across a different assay, we systemically selected a subset of Y2H-tested mutant protein interactions for retesting by PCA.
