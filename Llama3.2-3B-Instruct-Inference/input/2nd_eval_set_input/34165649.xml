Although structurally and mechanistically similar to the human lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (hNAGLU) in GH89 which is involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate in the lysosome, the reported bacterial GH89 enzymes characterized so far have no or low activity toward alpha-N-acetylglucosamine-terminated heparosan oligosaccharides, the preferred substrates of hNAGLU. We cloned and expressed several soluble and active recombinant bacterial GH89 enzymes in Escherichia coli. Among these enzymes, a truncated recombinant alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase from gut symbiotic bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron  22Bt3590 was found to catalyze the cleavage of the terminal alpha1-4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from a heparosan disaccharide with high efficiency. Heparosan oligosaccharides with lengths up to decasaccharide were also suitable substrates. This bacterial alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase could be a useful catalyst for heparan sulfate analysis.</text></passage></document></collection>
