Inflammatory responses due to the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been demonstrated to alter cellular metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in different cell populations, and hence increases the risks for organ toxicity including cancer. The exact molecular mechanism is however not clear. In the present study, we investigated the role and mechanism of an antioxidant, azadirachtin (AZD), a limonoid extracted from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica), against LPS-induced oxidative stress in the pancreatic beta-cell line, Rin-5F. We demonstrated that cells treated with LPS (1 microg/mL for 24 h) showed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Our results also showed that LPS induced alterations in the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, suppressing autophagy and augmenting apoptosis. Treatment with Azadirachtin (25 microM for 24 h), on the other hand, rendered some degree of protection to the pancreatic cells from apoptosis by inducing the autophagy signals required for cell survival. These results may have significance in elucidating the mechanisms of pancreatic beta-cell survival and death by balancing the molecular communication between autophagy and apoptosis under inflammatory and pathological conditions.</text></passage></document></collection>
